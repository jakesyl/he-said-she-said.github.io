jrajav - that's ok, now i'm thinking i should write something that does what i think the shell does - ie. walk the process tree sending lots of SIGINT events. My theory is that detached processes will not be in the tree as they will be in their own process groups. So now i'm trying to figure out how to send events to or enumerate process groups/trees :)
