jrajav: ok maybe i should just assume that ctrl-c will kill the whole process tree but it feels like a leap of faith. Particulalry as i'm pretty sure that I could write code (using the detached property?) that would result in ctrl-c not killing the whole process tree - so my test is supposed to show that i didn't accidentally do that (ie. i'm not testing node)
