Absolute0: personal experience. i can poke headius (charles nutter) on IRC and he'll respond. once i had an issue with openssl in jruby that would only occur when connecting to this one specific IIS server over https, but i couldn't give him access to it, code to reproduce with, or anything other than a backtrace. he had that shit fixed in jruby master within like 10-15 minutes. BAM. rock star.
