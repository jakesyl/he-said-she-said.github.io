TehShrike: Let's say I'm building a recipe site and want to store recipes, all recipes have at least a name and a unique identifier, a part from that, they can contain almost anything, some might have an "experience level", some a dish type (dessert, main course...), and some a set of ingredients. The set of properties will probably vary over time, I'd like to store everything as objects somewhere and easily do searches on whatever prope
