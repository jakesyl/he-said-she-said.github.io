Anyone using https+signed cert+ca-bundle successfully?  My self signed cert works fine but using the signed cert (with or without the ca-bundle) results in "139768612140704:error:140790E5:SSL routines:SSL23_WRITE:ssl handshake failure:s23_lib.c:177" from `openssl s_client -connect host:port -showcerts`
