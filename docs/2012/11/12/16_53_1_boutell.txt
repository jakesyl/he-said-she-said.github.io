Just reading backâ€¦ re: sethetter's questions, you might want to look at justjs.com, because the tutorials I presented there are focused on a pretty traditional web app that might otherwise get built in Rails, at least at first. (Eventually I went off into more frontend-heavy, REST-backed stuff as well.)
