What i wanted to use it for is ember-runner, don't know if anyone is familiar with that. ( https://github.com/envone/ember-runner ) -- to generate a single file (for the client) with different js files included in that. -- I thought that that was what the ember-runner-sample ( https://github.com/envone/ember-runner-sample ) did.
