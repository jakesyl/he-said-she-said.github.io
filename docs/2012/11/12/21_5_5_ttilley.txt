Absolute0: you want to start a server. and have it live. thus start it from init rather than from a tty that encloses a process group that goes away when you remove the controlling terminal. if you're worried about crashes and restarts, as well as logging and monitoring, augment with a system that provides this functionality... like supervisord/monit/god/etc.
