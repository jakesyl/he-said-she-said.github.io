Has anyone ever encountered JSON.parse() silently failing on invalid JSON? I validated it and apparently JSON.stringify() created a string that did not encapsulate an object's keys in double quotes. I'm a little baffled as I've not experienced this before. IE: JSON.stringify({ foo: 'bar' }) ending up as { foo: 'bar' } and then JSON.parse() saying no thank you. Do I have some notices not enabled or something?
