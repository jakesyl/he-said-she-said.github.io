othiym23: Yeah, that's what I was thinking, too. AppJS can take Express as a drop-in replacement for it's routing, but when it transfers control, it passes the 'http://appjs' to the request url, causing Express to handle it as a route to '/http://appjs/' for a route to '/'. Can't figure out a good way to do it with autodetection, since flatiron, et al can be dropped in there, too.
