this isn't directly node related, i'm using $ as an id to trigger a color change on IRC... so $c04blah would make "blah" red, i'm trying to make it so if i do \$c04blah it would just return "$c04blah", but it's not working for some reason. i tried to use [^\\]\$ and (?!\\)\$ -- anyone know what i'm doing wrong? =/
