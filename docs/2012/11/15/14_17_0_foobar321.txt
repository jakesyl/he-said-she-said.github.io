Hi. How to pass JavaScript variable inside Jade templates? I have page.jade which has div(data-role="page", id=pageId) and block content inside it. Now in other login.jade I want to extend page.jade and setup pageId variable. But var = does not work. Any ideas ? Or how I should resolve this problem ?
