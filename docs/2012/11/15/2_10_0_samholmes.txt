chilts: I found the issue was in my code. I thought .getDate printed a number 0-30, so I added 1 to it. Why I thought this was because my localhost (my computer) has the time set to GMT-7. So my dates where appearing as 17 hours into the previous day (24 - 7 = 17), so my dates are in fact behind 7 hours on my localhost.
