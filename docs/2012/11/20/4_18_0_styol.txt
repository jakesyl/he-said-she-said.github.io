Is anyone familiar with mocha + chai and why it chooses to fail on a timeout of 2000ms instead of a should/expect failure? Is that so that potentially more individual failures can be output? I noticed this does not happen without providing "done" to the it method callback, but this is an async request so I figured done is potentially required
