I'm migrating an unmaintained npm package from WAF to GYP but hit a bit of a stumbling block. In the WSCRIPT there is the line conf.env.append_value("FRAMEWORK_TC", '/Library/Frameworks/TelldusCore.framework/'). Is this the equivalent of doing 'defines': ['FRAMEWORKPATH_TC="/Library/Frameworks/TelldusCore.framework/"'] in binding.gyp, or instead of defines should I be using something else?
