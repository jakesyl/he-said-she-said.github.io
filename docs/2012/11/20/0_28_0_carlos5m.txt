Well I found this "TCP does not know, or care, about your program's concept of message framing. It does not care that you send 3 "messages" with separate calls to send. A valid TCP implementation could return a single byte for each call to a function that reads from the stream or it could buffer up as much as it feels like before returning bytes to you. You should code accordingly."
