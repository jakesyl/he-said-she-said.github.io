so.. I'm using Express and I made a site ( http://icom5016.ece.uprm.edu:3000/ ) when someone searches for a professor and there's no result, I throw em to a 404, I want to give em an alert (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/components.html#alerts).  Can anyone point me in the right way to do this @.@?
