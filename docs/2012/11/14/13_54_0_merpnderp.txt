mscdex: Anyways, thanks. So far mongo has been significantly faster in my tests, but I don't know if that's worth giving up all the groovy stuff in an RDBMS. My service will be free so I probably do need to optimize this for speed as I want to be able to service 100's of thousands of users on the cheapest joyent or amazon virtual.
