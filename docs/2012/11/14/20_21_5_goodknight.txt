I have an entire Node.js, Express, Socket.IO app that is written. It's functional and I know it all works. It's using Redis for data management for the time being but I'd like to stress test it a bit. Right now, during development, I'm only creating one connection at a time. Is there something (such as Mocha or whatever) that can get the server with 10,000 connections and run a series of functions?
