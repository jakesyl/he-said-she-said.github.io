this versions works just fine, but when I try to add indentation, I end up with double spaced output instead...  http://bpaste.net/show/2jpMxIWu49kNmVpFyoAn/ that tells me that it has to be in the concatenate functioin starting on line 53... it's only ten lines, so if anyone could have a look for me, that would be fabulous.
