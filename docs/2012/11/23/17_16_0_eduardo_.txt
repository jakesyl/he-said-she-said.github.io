guys can anyone help me it's making me nuts. i am using express with passport, trying to use FB authentication. after my callback is called, for some reason my page is rendered as "[object Object]" and i see the same in my console log. changing the url to anything, sticks it to the same output. its not being done from my code. any idea?
