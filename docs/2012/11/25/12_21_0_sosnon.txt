well, you can modify any 'Prototype' instance (since there can be plenty) at any time (since this is what __dict__ is for) at which will affect any new 'Prototype' instance created in the future; if you let it inherit from a bunch of other classes, you will mess up the Prototype and effectively introduce unwanted multiple inheritance (classical style)
