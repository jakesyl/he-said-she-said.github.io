hey hey everyone. i'm working on a big project and use nodejs under win7. i always having an error : Unknown system errno 31. after it the server crushes. and doesn't display any logs. i'm experiencing it for months. maybe it connected somehow to working with database. but maybe no, it's really bad. need help
