Hey guys! I am trying to start a http server in node.js using connect. When i open multiple instances (multiple clients), sometimes the dependent files are not being sent (mainly the images). I have to refresh the page repeatedly to get all the dependencies. And there is no error message in the console when this happens. Have you faced this issue before?
