can a connect middleware be a wrap around filter? I mean can it run code after the next middleware in the chain is complete? for example, if it has to set a response header based on the status code that could be set by middleware further down the chain, can it do it in code after the next() invocation? or is the only for it to do something like this is hook into other existing methods?
