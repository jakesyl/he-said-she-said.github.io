Hrm.. thus far I've only used express for http requests and I'm trying to tread lightly on this project, so I've foregone express for the time being. I need to parse out GET variables which is something that express handled with the req.query object, but I'm not seeing something similar in the core http(s) module. Anyone know if I'm missing something or do I need to do my own parsing of the req.url object to extract GET variables?
