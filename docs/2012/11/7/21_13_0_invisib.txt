So right now I'm trying to make an app with Django/TastyPie(makes APIs with Django models) and using Backbone/Pusher as the client. It does what I want (realtime updates to Django database and the page the user is currently viewing), but it seems like a lot of working parts. Could I replace my technique with Node?
