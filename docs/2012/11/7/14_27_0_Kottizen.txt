AAA_awright: I'm making a web based chat using Socket.IO and Node.JS. In my MySQL database I have two tables of importance, "conversations" and "participants". "conversations" keeps track of all conversations, with their subjects and date of last message. "participants" keeps track of who's in which conversation - each row has a conversation_id and a user_id.
