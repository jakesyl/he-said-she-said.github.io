caracos: If something is only being applied to the 'last' one of many, you have a scoping  problem. e.g.: in for (i=0; i<5; ++i) {doX(function(){ doY(i) })}; `doY' might only  receive 4 as a value. You can solve this using closures, so see !closures. For more  info see http://www.mennovanslooten.nl/blog/post/62/
