azbyin: no buddy, it still doesn't work, but at least it doesnot give the previous error, thanks for that, but now it does not write the result on the screen named 127.0.0.1:8888/fromServ and it returns value to the game client as null, but it copies it in the log accurately. so what it the problem :(
