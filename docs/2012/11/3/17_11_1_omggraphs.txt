aandy: Let's say i want to iterate over all nodes to see if they have matches (i.e. two nodes need to like each other), do you know how to do this. It seems that any query hogs up my machine. and in think it might be better to have a list of all nodes, and use every node as a start point individually instead of doing START n = node(*)
