I learned a little about html, js and php and am thinking I want to create websites (and web services) for clients. I am thinking I want to be self employed and provide hosting myself. I think node might fit the job, else if I was working for someone else then I guess I might have to learn php. Am I in over my head? Advice would be greatly appreciated
