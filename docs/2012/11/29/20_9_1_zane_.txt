tnorris: I'm about to try something desperate: keeping a file that represents all active API endpoints (eg, request that have been made, but not yet responded to). That way, when the process crashes, I can examine what was "alive" at that time (as well as all input). I'm afraid about the File IO overhead, but can't think of a better idea. Sound logical?
