sosnon, well, with express.. you can drop the binding of routing and rendering engine and use connect directly.. you can choose different authentication modules.. for my API service, it checks for a querystring/body/header for an api key for each request, and adds a user object for that user to request... other modules work differently.. you don't have to do much.. it just adds enough.
