so far the gist for me is: plow through the docs of flatiron/express/geddy/tower/... and crawl your way towards a usable app (by plugging in plenty of other modules for file uploading/streaming/...) or just ('just') set up your own rudimentary MVC, connect to your data store and then (finally) start to add features to your app
