tnorris: Well, again, we're not sure that the JS object allocation IS a string / JSON.stringify, but assuming it is, yes I know what the objects are that are 4Mb or so in size... I've done my best to reduce them, they're the streams themselves though, and are implicitly large (eg, mulitple RSS feeds). Most of what I've done is to try piping them directly into express' res.write() function instead of putting them in memory
