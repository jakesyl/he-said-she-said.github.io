nlf: sure, i'm not complaining about that, but in the case of 'module.exports.foo = foo; exports.foo = bar;' 'foo' will be foo, not bar and since some people set exports in the head of their files a second dev extending it and extending it in the bottom, may end up changing 0% of foo, but gets 100% confused since there is no error/warning, especially in larger projects
