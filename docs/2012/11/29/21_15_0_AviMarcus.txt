This might not be the best place to ask... I'm planning on making an API with restify (I have a smaller version already working) and then building a GUI that only uses that API for users. (e.g. Stripe.) Any recommendations for the gui side? I'm planning on using angular, but something that can automatically adapt to the API would be great during development.
