Yes i have been reading Express Framework for last week, love the flexibility of the middleware, connect etc.. Came across node with the "Meteor screencast" on railscast and love the realtime interaction... Just want to put all my energy into one framework at present and give it a go...(express, flatiron, meteor?!?!)
