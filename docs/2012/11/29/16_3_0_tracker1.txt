sosnon.. my first couple apps were backend processors, and then the email spool (essentially using a db for a list of emails to send), then started on an initial API.. not I've got a more feature complete API using express... so far it's come together pretty well.. .there's a lot you need to do by hand, but I equate this to using say bootstrap, because other options make way too many assumptions for you.
