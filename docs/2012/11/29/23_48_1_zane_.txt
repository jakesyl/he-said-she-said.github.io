tnorris: sorry for my newbishness here... I'm having a hard time determining what is nested. Eg, dominators has 1 object @ root that is 97% of "retained size" yet the contents are each objects which don't give me much clue as to what the parent object (owner) is... eg, I can't tell what the retained object is
