Just come across node recently, been using ruby, rails, javascript & html5 responsive web design for a while now, our company now wants an new internal intranet system, and website. I have been reading a few node blogs lately and starting to love the flexibility of what it can offer without "all the magic under the hood" that rails provides. Can anyone point me to learning resources, main coding patterns, frameworks to get started
