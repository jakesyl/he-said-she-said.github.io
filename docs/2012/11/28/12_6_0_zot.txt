back for more!  I've got SIGINT and 'exit' handlers done as suggested.  but when running from the command line debugger, neither, hitting CTRL-d or CTRL-c (2x) leaves me in the same place â€” no exit handler gets called.  it appears that SIGINT isn't passed through, and I have no idea what happens when you hit ctrl-D from the debugger.
