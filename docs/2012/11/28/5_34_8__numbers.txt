i am trying to install stylus-sprites. it wants node-gd installed as a depdency. but i am using latest node so only the git master branch of node-gd will compile successfully. how do i tell npm that when installing stylus-sprites, it should use the node-gd lib i already specified in package.json and which is already installed in the local ./node_modules/ dir?
