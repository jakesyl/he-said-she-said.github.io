chovy, migrating from ms-sql to mongo for a reading data for now... using a node.js script... one gets record(s) that have a modified date, newer than the migrated date, and tosses that record id into rabbitmq... another set of listeners get a record at a time, and import/process them...  if you're staing in mongo, I have a _meta property with a schema_version property... would use a script inside mongp directly to bump that.
