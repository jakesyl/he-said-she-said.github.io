sinclair|work: all that to say, I've found the attitudes in this channel to be pretty accepting of alternative views (classic ASP really kicks node in the teeth).  But yes, it's not a democracy, and yes, you can be kicked when you cross what you might feel to be nonsensical lines.  Isn't that how IRC operates in general?
