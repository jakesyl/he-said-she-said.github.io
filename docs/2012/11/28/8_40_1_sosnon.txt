konobi: what i'm interested in, nevertheless, is how i could 'model' it in a way that i have a Parser 'class'/object which does an async readFile call, but then provides the file contents in an easily accessible property (like 'var parser = Parser(); parser.parse(myfile); console.log(parser.fileContent)') as soon as readFile is done reading the file
