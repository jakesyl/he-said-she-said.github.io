Deployment readiness.   I'm looking to deploy a new Node.js application with an expected 1,500 req/s.  I'll be using nodes cluster module and will be spread over a few AWS instances.  I plan on using Forever to start/stop/monitor. httperf says I'm good for 18,000 req/s.   I'm looking for gotcha people have had to overcome in the past when deploying mayjor Node.js apps; lessons learned?.  I'm tentatively optimistic.
