is npm known to have problems with installing packages under sshfs mountpoints? I'm having a weird problem where installing 'express' fails in any directory that is under an sshfs mount (i.e. in ~/Remotes/myothermachine/tmp/foo, see pastebin link), but on my local fs it installs fine, I don't entirely understand the error it is throwing at me either: http://pastebin.com/AaK9PPBz
