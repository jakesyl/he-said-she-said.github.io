I have a number of Notifications, I loop through each notifcation (each notification can have multiple tokens to send the notifciation to), for each notification, I call pushNotification(notification.message, arrTokens);, In my pushNotification() function, I loop through all the tokens in the array but as it is currently, it is only using the first token of my array everytime.
