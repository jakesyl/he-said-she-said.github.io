tnorris: ah. I need to learn more about buffers. The only other time I've touched them was when trying to convert one to a string that was a hex token, but I wouldn't particularly consider it exposure. May I ask, since you seem pretty comfy with them, some other common uses? I think I know that they are generally used/related to binary data but that is about it.
