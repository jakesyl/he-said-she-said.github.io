i'm having immense problems with setting up a private repo. "adduser" works fine, and it ends with "Authorized user foo", but any subsequent login attempts with that user fails (login, publish, etc). it always responds these login attmpts with "Name or password is incorrect". I've tried creating the most trivial users with simple passwords to no avail...
