deoxxa: No, latest. And I actually just figured out out... I am developing in a linux VM, with a windows host. My dev directory is a dir on my windows host mounted via CIFS on the linux VM... the socket.io install requires symlinks which windows does not support. Installing into a directory local to the VM works fine.
