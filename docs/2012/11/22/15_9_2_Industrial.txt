But somewhere down the line an HTTP response needs to be sent. I was wondering if I can do that ina  different ZeroMQ node then the one that got the (req, res) callback. If not then all the messages through the system leading to a response must end at that seome point again? kinda meh.. :-) I'm not sure if I'm thinking about this the right way.
