one more problem with the whole .js -> .coffee/ .coffee -> .js dance for already existing projects is the loss of comments/overheat with comments (docco, for instance does not support multiline comments while .coffee -> .js only preserves multiline comments and using a pre-commit hook just to remove all the "/*" and "*/" becomes annoying)
