Hi, I am having the exact issue mentioned in this report: https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io/issues/749 ... The submitter says he resolved the issue by "manually cloning uglify-js". Any hints on how I might go about doing that? Simply putting the correct uglify-js folder in node_modules/socket.io/node_modules does not work -- npm wipes that whole folder before starting it's install. Thanks.
