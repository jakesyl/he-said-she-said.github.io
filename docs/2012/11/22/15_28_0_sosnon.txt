i'm not actually talking about the serialization as such, but rather the CRUD part, so i could just say 'helperthingy.save(mystuff);' and 'helperthingy.update(mystuff);' and it handles validation/duplication checking/err callbacks/... automatically; but forget it, it is a horrible way of complicating things, writing an adapter once and adjusting it for various apps seems more sane
