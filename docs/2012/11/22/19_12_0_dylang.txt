i'm using cluster with Doodle or Die just because we mostly code late at night and deploy often, sometimes with buggy code. thanks to cluster if a worker crashes and burns there are a couple other workers more than happy to accept the connections while the crashed worker restarts. to the end users it feels like zero downtime except for the one user who killed a worker, and a browser reload fixes that.
