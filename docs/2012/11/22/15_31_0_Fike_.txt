So, in my code I have a socket object. I have the event listeners set up for it, however I'm not trying to add SSL/TLS support. So, in the options object I did socket: this.socket, which works fine. However when it connects it returns all this gibberish to my terminal and my parser doesn't work on it. I have no experience with the tls module, could someone help me out? :)
