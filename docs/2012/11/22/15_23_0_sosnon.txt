aandy: one more thing, there is no node-specific 'serialization' protocoll which would allow dumping data and then 'importing' it into various data stores (mongo, redis, ...) (besides JSON, of course), is there? something like pickling just for development so one could skip/delay writing adapters for a while during prototyping etc.
