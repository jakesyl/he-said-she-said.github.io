works fine stand-alone. I can start from a blank slate, git clone and npm install it.. everything is great. But if I depend on this package from another package,  I get npm ERR! Failed at the tinyapp@0.0.1 postinstall script. Further up I see: Local Npm module "grunt-browserify" not found. Is it installed?
