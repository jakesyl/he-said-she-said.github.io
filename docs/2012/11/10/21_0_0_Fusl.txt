niggler, yep i know.. so i thought i can buffer the entire input (character-wise) and print it out, when a new stdout was executed... BUT: this example http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8233097/detect-enter-in-keypress-event-node-js-rawmode does not work... maybe because i'm connected with ssh to the server?
