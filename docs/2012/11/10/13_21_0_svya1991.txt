necco: Thank you so much... There were 2 errors, in fact... Both of them were '/' errors... https://gist.github.com/f0901fccaa5e29686920 One, as you noticed, was in the JS code (app.post statement) the 2nd was in the jade code, line 2... It should've read '/ads/likes/'+ad._id ... The 2nd '/' was missing... Thanks a lot again!!!
