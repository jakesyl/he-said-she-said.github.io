hi, i want to learn some nosql db, as i want all my stack in js(i only know js btw). mongo seems popular, but i was reading about loss of data, etc. that puts me off a lil. then i was reading about couch, seems fine although it doesn't scale, etc. then i was looking into riak, and so far, it looks like the best choice. note that i'm not looking into that debate about relational db or not, i just want a db that works with js. give your opinio
