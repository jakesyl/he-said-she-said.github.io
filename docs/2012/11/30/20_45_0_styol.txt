Conceptual questionâ€¦ if you're writing functions for something that will only be used internally, at a certain point is it pointless and possibly less performant to be checking for the existence of function arguments, a specific type of those arguments, and so forth? Essentially something that, when used properly internally, will never change. Granted, user input being exempt from that scenario.
