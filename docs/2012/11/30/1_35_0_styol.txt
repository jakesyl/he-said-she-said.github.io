I've been playing with couchbase but it is still in development node module wise. Also, the 2.0 version that has map/reduce type views (written in javascript) does not have a stable release yet, but scaling wise it is pretty awesome and easy. It is probably neither here nor there as there are probably 3 people in the node community using it ;)
