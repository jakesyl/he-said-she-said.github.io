AAA_awright, everything from the parser downward is stream programming. May as well start it here. Having to return es.pipeline(tagger, next_parser) hints that I could have rolled all this together, but writing the unit tests to reassure myself that I'd done the back pressure right in that context would have driven me a little nuts. :)
