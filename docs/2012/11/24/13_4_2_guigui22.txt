Hi! I'm knew in node.js. For a university project, I would like to realize a server in node that allow the user to know the fattest way to go from a point A to a point B. I was thinking about using the dijkstra algorithms. But my city provides the data using the GTFS format.. Does anyone already used it? I don't know how it's work..
