trankil, no, well it not the focus, just plain old webdesign is the focus, but being cheap is a focus, and using free templates will help my customers save money, if they want me to design, it will cost more.  I will charge by the hour, like $20/hr, so if they use a free template, they will save the hours taken for me to code their custom design
