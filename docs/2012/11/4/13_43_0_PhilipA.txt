Hi I am new to node.js, and uses expressjs. Hope someone can help me with a wierd issue. It seems like when I look at my command promt when loading the front page that the static files are loaded in an endless loop. All the scripts and stylesheets are given a dynamic id like: /javascripts/lib/angular.js?_=1352036376699 200 5ms - 465.22kb Anyone got an idea what might be wrong?
