Can someone help me with rsa encryption? I am trying to make secure connection with php and node using rsa public/private keys. I need to encrypt on node side with private key and decrypt on php side using public key. I tried using http://phpseclib.sourceforge.net/ and https://github.com/Obvious/ursa/
