Hey guys.. looking to leverage Node.JS to do some web socket stuff (possibly with Faye or Socket.IO), however I want to integrate it with an existing site... ideally I don't want to be using non-standard ports (which can cause firewall issues for people), so are there any options like a Node.JS reverse proxy, or a reverse proxy that works with web sockets?
