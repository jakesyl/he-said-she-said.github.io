I'm using node to write some client side code, because it is the best environment to do javascript TDD that I have found. How am I supposed to organize my code so that I can easily test individual units in isolation and also easily bundle everything together? I like the simplicity of node's require, which makes me lean toward something like browserify. Thoughts?
