larzconwell: Well, I think what you suggested works, but there's another problem now... The browser displays another Reference error, saying that "flash" is not defined... When I comment out lines 31 and 32 from here: https://gist.github.com/954e78c46158007c0e34 (my layout.jade) it renders the page, but not completely... The buttons on the top are coming, but the drop down and search box aren't... A little more help, please???
