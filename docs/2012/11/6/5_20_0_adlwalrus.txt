would anyone mind looking over my build script real quick, before I run it? it's my first script on node.js, and I don't want to write over any work or otherwise make my machine explode, so I'm a little nervous to run it without any review... :-/ It's only 65 lines, and fairly straight forward -- just meant to concatenate and minify my js files... http://dpaste.org/VyiMa/ thanks to anyone who has the spare minute.. :)
