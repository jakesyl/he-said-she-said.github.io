when the user logs out so I end up having stale views when the user is no longer logged in (expired session) or otherwise. What do you propose is the best way to handle timing out a user -- possibly from inactivity or just predicting staleness of a view. I currently have two datasets. Users with an array of tickets and tickets with arrays of users.
