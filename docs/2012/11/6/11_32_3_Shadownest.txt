Morning ! i would like to make a REST API in node.js using http... and i've got a question ! My API must be easily edited (adding/removing/modifying actions), that's why i would like to use the filesysteme as route (asking : /aaa/bbb/ccc should open the file ./aaa/bbb/ccc.js), is it better to use require() and catch the missing file error (is require() enough fast for an api?) or should i use something else ?
