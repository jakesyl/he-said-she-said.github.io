Say I create a HTTPServer EventEmitter that wraps a http.createServer() and emits 'request' events when a request happens; I want other parts (e.g. Template loader) to connect to this to eventually form the response to send to response.send(). What I don't understand is how to keep track of the reqquest/response objects.
