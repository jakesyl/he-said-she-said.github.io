hey everyone. my scenario is this: when a user requests for a file, i'm checking with fs.exists if this file exists on the server. if it is not, i'm getting it from amazon s3 and when the stream ends i'm sending the file. then, i want to set a timer to delete the file in the near future (there is some caching because i'm expecting that other users will request the same file in the near future).
