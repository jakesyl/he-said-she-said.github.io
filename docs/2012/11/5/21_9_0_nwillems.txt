can I be unserious for a moment? I have some weirdness with the mkdirp module :( I have a small script that runs and keeps to workers alive(aka respawns) as child procceses, when the workers start they make a log directory for themself but at somepoint after 4 hours one of the workers decide that it doesn't have access to the directory structure anymore and therefore throws an EACCES error.
