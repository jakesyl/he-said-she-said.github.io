Hello everyone, I'm currently coding a school project and decide to implement with nodejs, mongodb, and mongoosejs. I can run a certain query with sort in the mongod shell, but I cannot get my NodeJS to retrieve the same data. My node-code is only working with .find(-stuff-) and .findOne(dsasf). Any ideas?
