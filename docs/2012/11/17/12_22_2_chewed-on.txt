aandy: there are reasons to do certain things server side than client side, for example, if you want to re order a table of data based on row weights, it would be faster having a stored procedure in the SQL database and using the client code to tell the server to execute the stored procedure to reorder the table rows (I am talking about HTML table rows of data).
