I have a quick security question... Using express. I get a POST with a text field, and I want to save what the client sends to me in a text file. If I use: fs.writeFile('dir/', req.body.code, callback);, is there a risk that the code in the body can be escaped? for example, in the req.body.code, if it were to end in \, could it be used to escape? I'm not sure how Javascript evaluates the code. Or since I'm using the variable, do I avoid this?
