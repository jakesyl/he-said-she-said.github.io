I'm not sure, that would depend on what their team was good at. Haskell might have been a good choice, but no one will ever know. Node didn't exist at the time, but there are some problems with memory limitations if I remember correctly â€” it still rocks, though. Maybe Go, maybe Erlang, maybe lots of other good languages/tools.
