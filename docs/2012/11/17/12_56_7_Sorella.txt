agu10^_, again, you won't be seeing AAA games in the browser anywhere in the near future. That's not what the browsers are for, there is too much overhead, JS is not a language for low-level stuff, and the pipeline is entirely driven by the browser. But you will see lots of acceptable games, that run on multiple platforms without much work.
