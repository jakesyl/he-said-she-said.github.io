Sorella:  recently, I've picked up Symfony web framework, it was great that it can completely separate data, business logic and presentation, it had an ORM Doctrine for data management, a Twig Template engine for Presentation and it structured the controllers into folders and such, I am wondering if Node JS have something similar, I don't want to go back to writing websites with raw PHP :P
