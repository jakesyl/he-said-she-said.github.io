I'm running into a rather strange problem.. I have a local machine and a dev machine both with phantomjs.. I have the following code: https://gist.github.com/29400ca068e85891e4ff and it works fine on my local machine.. but on the dev server I get a 504 timeout with it... both are behind nginx with the same configs, both have the same version of phantomjs.. any ideas?
