I'm not sure going about from hereâ€¦ I use lxc groups for php-fpm and because php and mysql are fucked, "localhost" is always the local socket (which isn't accessible because >lxc containers).. i made a small nodejs proxy that pipes things through which is working fine, now sometimes i have runaway queries taking more than n time, is there a way i can kill a socket/connection if it takes longer than "x" secs?
