hi all.. i'm trying to use cluster module to have several workers and make them exit gracefully. it mostly works, except in case of keep alive connections. I'm using it on ec2, and their load balancer opens long-lived connection to my nodes, even if the actual requests are sent very rarely.. so node.js cluster does not shut down in such case :(
