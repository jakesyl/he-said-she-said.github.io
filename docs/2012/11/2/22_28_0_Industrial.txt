Say I have a few different kinds of eventemitters (Website, Logger). I'm not sure how to 'connect' these e.g. When creating a Website should I create a Logger too? What if I only want one Logger and 10 Website's, can I connect all those to one Logger EventEmitter but still know where the message came from with each log message? Could I be running these EventEmitters on different hosts/processes?
