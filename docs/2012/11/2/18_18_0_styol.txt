Anybody by chance familiar with a decent guide or example on user registration / user login with salted passwords? I'm presently checking out an example that appears to require that you save the salt along with every password, but I may be interpreting it wrong or generally not understanding: https://github.com/alexyoung/nodepad/blob/master/models.js explanations on the salt aspect are also welcome (line 40 - line 84)
