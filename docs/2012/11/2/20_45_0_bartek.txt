Are there any decent patterns for storing the result of something into a variable without going through callback hell? I am using the node redis client and I do a .get() for my key. If it doesn't exist, I have to make an external call, then I have a callback on success to set the key. Now I just want to do var result = MyFunction() .. What kind of pattern should I be doing to achieve this?
