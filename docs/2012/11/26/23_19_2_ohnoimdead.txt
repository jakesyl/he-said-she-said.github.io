othiym23: i would do that (just include the full node_modules folder in the package) however we have two npm packages that compile native code which i believe is done as a part of npm install. so i think what i need is to have the source of each npm package available in the debian package bootstrap chroot thingy and do the npm install from there. unless i'm just thinking about this all wrong (which is entirely possible and i would be delighted to hear).
