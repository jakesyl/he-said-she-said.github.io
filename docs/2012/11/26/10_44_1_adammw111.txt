HI all. I'm trying to write a node.js module to use the rtmp protocol but I'm coming a bit unhinged on my api design, I think partially due to my heavily OO design and stateful nature of the protocol. going back, should i be considering using Streams and if so, how do Streams that do processing work generally? Does anyone know of examples that do similar things?
