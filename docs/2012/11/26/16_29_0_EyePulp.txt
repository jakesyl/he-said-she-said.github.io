jrajav: Finding stuff (via google we'll say) doesn't necessarily help you implement it in the context of your own code.  Finding is one skill, implementing is another, and quality of implementation a degree of that latter skill.  I'd say a "good" programmer should have both the discovery and implementation skills in high amounts.
