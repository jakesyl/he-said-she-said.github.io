hey everyone, im interested in using node.js for a project involving drupal and an ios/android app. could anyone point me in the right direction to start learning? i figured i should just ask the expert source first instead of wasting all my time googling with no result. im a complete newbie to node.js, but im decently familiar with jquery and javascript to the level that i can guess most things correctly
