well, part of the whole debian bootstrap chroot thingy is to provide an environment identical to the target install environment. so building from there totally works. i just can't actually get the npm packages from there. in sad, but maybe humorous news, i tried using npm cache add then include that in the source for our build thinking that doing an npm install would try to install from the cache and maybe not care it has no internets. but no. not the way
