substack: so in this case, i'm reading N images, and encoding their data to base64, and dumping something like ".foo { background-image: url(" + base64encodeddata + "); }" to the css file - so the stream is going to give me chunks of image data, right? so how do i ensure that all the encoded data arrives in the right order, and in between the prefix and suffix strings?
