hello! i'm very new to nodejs and i try to get this sample running (http://vijayannadi.wordpress.com/tutorials/sample-chat-app-using-nodejs-socketio/). but everytime i points my browser to the sample, the node server quits with the message: "Can't set headers after they are sent." Have you an idea, what's going wrong? i use the latest version of nodejs from git. thanks.
