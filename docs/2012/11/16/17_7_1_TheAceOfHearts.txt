so.. I wanna use MVR (http://benedmunds.com/2012/04/19/simple-nodejs-express-mvr-template/), but I wanna do authentication from a MySQL database... I'm thinking of using Passport (https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport), but I'm not sure where to put the configuration and such @_@... Could anyone point me in the right direction?
