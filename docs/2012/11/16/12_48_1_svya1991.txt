RLa: Redirection issue. This page is rendered in x.js, and I want to send the variable "items" to /ad/like, as I've written on line 33... trankil: I need to display the results from a database query on this particular jade, but when the button (line 34) is clicked, I want the results being displayed on the page to be sent to the /ad/like page, too...
