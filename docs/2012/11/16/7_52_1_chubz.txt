hey guys, node beginner here. any help would be appreciated... so i'm trying to pass file properties to a post method, but im not too sure how to do it. I know how to upload a file, i did this example. https://github.com/ntanya/node-file-upload/blob/master/upload.js But I'm wondering how can i upload without having to use a form? IE i already have a file i want to upload so i want the script to do it by itself
