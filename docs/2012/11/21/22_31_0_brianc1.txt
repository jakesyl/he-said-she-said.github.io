tnorris: is not big deal to pull down a large amount of data from the API. it does 100 per page, so you can pull down a few hundred a second. so 2-3 seconds of loading should get a lot of notification data. then I just gotta display it pretty and make information surface from it.  I'll give it a shot anyway.  I'll send you a msg when I make some progress
