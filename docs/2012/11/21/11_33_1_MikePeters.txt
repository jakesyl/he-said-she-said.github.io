clever: Yeah now that I understand things better, I am sure plugging in redisstore to my two node.js instances will fix things.  But still I'm not happy with socket.io (I assume socket.io is to blame) inability to properly handle the "not handshaked" error and no one over at the many socket.io threads coming up with a solution for it.
