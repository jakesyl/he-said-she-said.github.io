Actually I am first going to try replacing socket.io with sock.js.  I am reading nice things about it. (Thanks for the reference!). My hope is that sockJS does a better job handling with the scenario of node.mydomain.com switching from ip1 to ip2 in the middle, having the client properly realize that, disconnect and reconnect.  It sounds like from node.js perspective things should work well
