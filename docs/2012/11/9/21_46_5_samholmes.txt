I had the idea of forking browserify or starting a new project entirely that does the require-y stuff, but wrap a package manager/registry around the project directly solely at providing a collaborative framework for front-end code. Firstly, I'd include a lot of the jQuery kinds of native stuff such as domready and selector tools etc, but doing it all in a require-y way. I'd call it the phi project or possibly tau.
