Anyone aware of an awesome example method for function argument validation? I've been finding myself repeating the same sanity checks at the beginning of functions and I'd like to turn it into a function or otherwise that is less duplicatey. If not, perhaps any recommendations on things to test for? Right now I mostly just utilize (typeof foo === 'undefined') but I suspect I'm missing some things. Perhaps even just common keywords or phrases for this notion?
