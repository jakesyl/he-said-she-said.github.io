mscdex: sry to be more precise, i changed registry settings for f:/StartMenu to c:/StartMenu.. The thing is i installed the msi last year (i think it was 0.6.8) so i was able just to copy the node.exe from the download site and overwrite my existing one.. however the msi also installs npm, i cant ask other developers to start changing their reg settings
