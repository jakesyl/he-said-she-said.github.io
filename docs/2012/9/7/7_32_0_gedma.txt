Hello guys, after a couple of weeks using node.js and finding it awesome, I decided to try out developing a module. It has to do with caching (memory/redis) http(s) requests' response; I needed something fast to handle REST API calls to Twitter preventing rate issues. Any comment would be really appreciated https://github.com/matteoagosti/node-request-caching
