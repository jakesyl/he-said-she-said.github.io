Owner: did you see this part?: "There is a workaround, but I donâ€™t see the benefit: use a TCP proxy (there is a custom module for this by Weibin Yao, see here ). However, you cannot run another service on the same port (e.g. your main app and Socket.io on port 80) as the TCP proxy does not support routing based on the URL (e.g. /socket.io/ to Socket.io and the rest to the main app), only simple load balancing."
