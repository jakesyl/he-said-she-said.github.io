hi, i'm currently looking for the right platform that i can use with a project. it will a web application that should be able to handle many concurrent connections and long running pull requests. is there a good article about Node.js that tell's where it performs good and where not. (i for sure will do my own benchmarks, but i want to have a brief overview)
