We currently use StatsD to gather information about calls, but does not help when we could potentially have a blocking issue on Node. Any tips on how to gather this info? NPM modules, etc..? Coming from Java where I have jstacks / jconsole / jmx / thread dumps. Little info on these type of tools for Node.
