Hey everyone. I'm looking for a good facebook graph api library. I don't need express or connect integration (I'm using socket.io), but I'd like it to handle signedRequest validation (since I'm using the javascript sdk for fb login). I've now looked at a couple, but there are so many libraries for this around and a lot of them are fairly crappy, so I'd love some suggestions.
