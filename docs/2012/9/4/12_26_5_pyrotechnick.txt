The reason this is necessary is to allow cycles to be resolved. You can see an example of this here:http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/modules.html#cycles. If you could invalidate the cache somehow, you could cause an infinite loop due to circular dependencies. Even if you can be reasonably confident that your application code won't cause this, it could happen in any libraries you use.
