Hello, I'm having issues with massive memory 'leaks', I'm using reading a file line by line and converting them into objects and using 'node-mongodb-native' to store them in a collection. My issue seems to be when I run 'collection.update', as it stores a ton of objects with each update. Anyone know how to prevent or clear the objects when this happens?
