I am trying to request a web page that serves some JSON using the request npm. It seems to take forever and all my tests (written in mocha) timeout. Apprantly for others it's never been an issue. The time it takes to execute the request call should be same time approximately as you would see in your browser wouldn't it? It takes my request more than two minutes. Would you guys like me to put this question/code up on stackover
