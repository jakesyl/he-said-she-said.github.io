Anyone know how you can publish an alpha/beta version of a new major release to NPM and still have people install the "latest" version by default? I tried publishing a 0.1.0-alpha but doing an `npm install <module>` would then install the 0.1.0-alpha version instead of my current stable `0.0.9` version.
