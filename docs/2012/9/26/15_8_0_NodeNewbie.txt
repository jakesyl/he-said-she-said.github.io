So - question about client certificates, websockets, and node v0.8.9 - It seems that if I turn on rejectUnauthroized:true - that any access of the https server with a client certificate works fine. However, with ws, websocket, or socket.io - they all fail with "socket hung up" or connection reset. Seems something down in TLS.js is barfing on an SSL3 error about "Get peer certificate".
