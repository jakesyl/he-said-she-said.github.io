I have a bit of a problem. I'm using handlebars templates on the server, but now that I want to play with Ember.js a bit, which also uses handlebars templates but for the client, I find myself embedding client handlebars code in server handlebars code, and the server handlebars doesn't like it. Can I get it to ignore parts of the template?
