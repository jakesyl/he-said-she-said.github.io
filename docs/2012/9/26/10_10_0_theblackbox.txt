hello all, I'm attempting to utilise socket.io but I can't figure out for the life of me why socket.io.js is not available client side. From the MANY examples I've found it should be made available through the serverâ€¦ so the only thing I could conclude was that it isn't doing this because I'm using testify and not express, but this seems odd and I get no error messages
