ljharb: If you need proof enough the difference between an objectid, and tags and branches, a commit id is mathematically related to the contents it's identifying. A mathematical set is uniquely identified only by it's contents, and since a hash is *uniquely* determined by the contents it's pointing to, you can also use a hash to identify a set. This is why Git uses a hash tree, and not tags for identifying commits, subtrees, and blobs.
