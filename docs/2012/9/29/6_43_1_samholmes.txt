I think it's the browser vendors duty to make sure their shit works with existing apps. If it doesn't then they're users will suffer, and should think twice before buying crappy products. If I made a crappy web browser, and tricked a bunch of idiots to use it, does that mean that developers are now forced to support it and degrade their apps?
