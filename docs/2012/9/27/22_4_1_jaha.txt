How can I add modules to client side dynamically? id like my JS app to check if a module is installed, if so, require and run, if not, download, then require and run, id like to use something like npm but the modules will be more like javascript apps instead of node modules (node.js will server multiple "minigames" to the local browser and download them from a server if out of date or not installed)
