superjoe: I'm setting up a mobile version of my site. I decided to server the mobile app from a different port on my server. My main app serves on 8000, the mobile app will server on 8002. I'm already using bouncy to route the different ports to the different domains, so I plopped m.mydomain.com in the bouncy routes.json file and set it to port 8002.
