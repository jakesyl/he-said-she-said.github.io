in short, I had a "ghost" log server process running that was duplicating insert I was doing. Since I use a redis backend with pub/sub I could have a dozen log server receiving the logs and inserting them in the same database. So since I had this ghost process running whenever I was logging an event from my web server it was inserted twice in the db...
