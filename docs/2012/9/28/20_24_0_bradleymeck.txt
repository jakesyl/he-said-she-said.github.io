tnorris: having that large of object in memory unless you are doing something crazy like reimplementing a memory allocation strategy is 1. going to destroy locality on the translation lookaside buffer 2. probably means you are loading something for large computations or static assets otherwise and would be better suited in some other language meant for large memory/cpu bound tasks
