mscdex: It's something to do with the build I think. My version of VS2010 only builds 32bit apps, although I'm on 64bit windows. So it wouldn't build serialport from the 64bit version of node. So I installed the 32bit version and it seemed to build it ok. However I'm guessing it didnt' actually build it correctly
