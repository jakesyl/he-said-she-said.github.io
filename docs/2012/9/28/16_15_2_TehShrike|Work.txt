substack: lets say you have a process that's accessible via dnode, from the browser and from other processes running on the server.  How would you differentiate between connections from clients, and a connection from another service?  Does it seem reasonable to run those on different ports, and just make sure that the port that other processes use to connect is not publicly accessible?
