Well, I write to a json file in the parent. lsof tells me what filenames a process has open. The child process has multiple write instances open of a file the parent wrote. ie. if the parent has some unrelated writeFile going on while doing child_process.spawn, you will leak against ulimit open file. My stuff is suppoed to run for months, AND be perfect...
