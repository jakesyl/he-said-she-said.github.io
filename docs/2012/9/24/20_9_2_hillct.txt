isaacs: how do I pass build arguments for dependencies within package.json? For example my app depends upon mongodb and I want to always pass the argument --mongodb:native to coerce it to build the binary BSON parser. Is there a way I can indicate this within my package.json? Or to at least default to native binary builds where possible?
