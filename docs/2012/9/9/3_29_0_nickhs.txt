Hey! I have an array of URLs (containing pngs) that I would like to download and write to file - I currently do so using request(url).pipe(fs.createWriteSteam(filename)) and then traverse the array using array.forEach. Is that the best way to go about it? And how do I know when all the downloads are completed?
