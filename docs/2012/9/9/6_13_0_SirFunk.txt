ok. let me describe the speciffic problem i had that made me start trying this mess. I have an object called a Piece. each Piece can have many Runs. All the data is stored on my backend. I wanted to be able to call piece.runs and have it check to see if it has loaded the data yet. if not fetch it , if so return a cached copy
