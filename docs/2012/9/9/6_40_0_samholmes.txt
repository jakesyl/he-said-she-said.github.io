Using dnode/shoe, what's a good way to authenticate RPCs? If I have a RPC method called removeSomeData on the server, that removes some kind of data on the server, but you have to be the owner of that data, how can I authenticate that you are the owner of this data? I already have HTTP authentication using express' session middleware.
