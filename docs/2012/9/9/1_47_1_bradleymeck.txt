samholmes: ipc requires the server to keep the object alive for future communication as long as a client may be using it, dnode has some measures to help with that, but if an event emitter is created per connection and there are dangling clients you should not GC the emitter, this can lead to possible memory leaks due to silent clients improper closing of connections etc.
