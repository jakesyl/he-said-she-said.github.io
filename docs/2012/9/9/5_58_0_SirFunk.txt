deoxxa: well I'm thinking of writing a "model" library. Where every object's real data will be stored in _data but then you would have setters/getters that could do other stuff.. it's much nicer to write myModel.age rather than myModel.name -- which isn't overridden and then myModel.age() elsewhere if it is computed
