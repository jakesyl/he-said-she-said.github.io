I want to use cluster to take advantage of the multiple cpus. However, they need to share some data. I tried Redis, but there's a chance of locking issues/race condition. Would it be a good idea to store some memory in the cluster's master and use messaging? So that the workers can access the data without having to worry about locking issues?
