I haven't worked with binary buffers since 0.4.x something, can someone tell me the best way to accumulate binary data (a JPG image in this case) in a buffer, preferably using pipe. And yes I know I should be using streams all over but S3 doesn't support transfer-encoding: chunked so I'll have to buffer it.
