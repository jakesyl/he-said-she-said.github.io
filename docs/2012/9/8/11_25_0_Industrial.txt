I'm trying ot get remote debugging working on a ubuntu 12.04 VPS. I have started the debugger with --debug-brk=8881 and added 8881 in the firewall. I think it has something to do with domain name resolving. if I take the small script from the node site (https://gist.github.com/e3fb6e2837d071403548) and run it on 127.0.0.1:8881 then it's not approachable by eg telnet.
