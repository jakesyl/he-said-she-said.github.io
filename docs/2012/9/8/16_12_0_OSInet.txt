hello. I have  a problem with NPM: I replicated the registry locally, and check it with the CouchDB console without problem. However when I go "npm install -g http://localhost:5684/registry somecomponent", npm fails with a 401 on http://localhost:5684/registry/somecomponent, although I can access this URL without a problem in a browser, with CURL, GET, wget, or just a plain telnet localhost 5684 and a manual HTTP request. Any suggestions ?
