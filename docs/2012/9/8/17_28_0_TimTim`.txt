suppose i have my own set of utility functions in its own module that multiple modules will use, i would have to require that file at the top of every other module right?  and also suppose i have an instance of a redis client (e.g., redis = new (require('/home/user/node_modules/redis')).createClient()) that i want every other module to have access to, i'd have to make every module using that
