i had a friend who stayed with me for ages, we were best mates in my last year of high school. he ended up leaving out of the blue one night, stealing a bunch of money from my mum and taking my bike (that i needed to get to work). so i know how you feel, i guess... but yeah, it never really started to feel better until i just decided to go on with things.
