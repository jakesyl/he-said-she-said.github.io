Unrelated to Node. My best friend was in a bind so I let him stay with me at my mom's house for a while, he offered to help with a home improvement project that ended up taking all summer (should have been 1-2 weeks)… my mom kicked him out because he's a slob and now I'm trying to finish up the room… he ruined tons of tools that were borrowed, got paint in things I can't sand and basically I'm realizing he drug out this project
