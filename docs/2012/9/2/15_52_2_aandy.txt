Hi, I have a generic "design" question. I have two connections I need to make, and when both have been established, I wish to do something. How should I do this (best practice)? One way would be to issue connect for both, and have them emit a "connected" event, and check if the other is connected aswel, but that seems "wrong" to have the logic in both. Any thoughts on this?
