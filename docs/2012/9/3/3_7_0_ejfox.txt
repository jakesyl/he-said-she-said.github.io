Hi all, super duper nooby question here. I am working off the node boiler plate. I've got my server.get('/', etcâ€¦ running properly. However I have a bunch of stuff in my views/ folder that my index.html file depends on. However when the page tries to get them it gets a 404. How would I let the server serve these, without making them server.get routes one-by-one. Again pardon the noobyness
