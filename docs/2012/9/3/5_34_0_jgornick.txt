hey guys, i've just updated to the latest node 0.8.8 through homebrew. i noticed that the new formula also installs npm. when i install a package globally, something is not linking properly for me to access bins from the pakcages. it doesn't seem like it's adding the symlinks from /usr/local/bin to where the npm modules bins are being installed.
