if i want to install a package from npm, like express, i go into the root folder of my project and run npm install express, and it creates a folder called node_modules/express in the root of my project. express has its own node modules in its folder, with its dependencies. i then install two packages that both depend on redis.  does each redis dependent package also install its own copy of package redis as a dependency?
