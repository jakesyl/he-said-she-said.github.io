Hey guys, basic javascript/coffeescrip question here. Trying to get https://github.com/Hoverbear/Gathering-Our-Voices-Testing/blob/master/config/routes.coffee#L13 to not give errors when ultimately called by https://github.com/Hoverbear/Gathering-Our-Voices-Testing/blob/master/server.coffee#L48 (Which has the definition for Groups)
