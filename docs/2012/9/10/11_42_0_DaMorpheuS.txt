I need nosql because I don't want my app to be restricted on a predefined datamodel. Because my idea I need large amount of data to be put in the database. and the output can change every day so if I create a datamodel around this my tool has boundries I don;t want to have. With nosql the boundries are not in the database anymore but are in you code is much easier to change.
