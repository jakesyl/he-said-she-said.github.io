okay, yeoman was the last drop. seriously people, does one really need all those scaffolding tools? how many projects do you start anyway? I've created 3 in the past month. why is "init" the favorite command? No, I don't find it hard to initialize my directory structure. I do it once every 2 weeks. Thats a liberal estimate.
