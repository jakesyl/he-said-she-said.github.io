Is there a problem with v0.9.2 and debugging? When I use the following "node-inspector & node --debug-brk test.js" with the default Ubuntu 12.04 repo nodejs (v0.6.12), debugger works correctly, but when I use v0.9.2, program executes to completion. The same occurs in Webstorm. Breakpoints are ignored.
