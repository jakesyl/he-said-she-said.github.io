tnorris: > db.conquers_en1.find() \n { "_id" : ObjectId("5057ba5b6bab1185bc6bc542"), "id" : "2803", "new" : [ "3071" ], "old" : [ "3050" ], "time" : [ "1150774485" ] } <-- it seems to insert a single object, but the callback never fires so i can't resume the line reader.. i have no idea what's going on http://thepb.in/private/5057bb5a88b085410b000009
