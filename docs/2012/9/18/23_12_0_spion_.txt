tnorris, I probably need to improve the readme though. there is a central registry and there are workers. you can connect to it and ask it to create named "actors" (basically tiny services) and it will, on a random worker. you can also ask it to get you a client to that actor. afterwards all streaming (or on higher level actors, message passing) is done between whatever process you're in and whatever worker the actor is working in.
