hi. ruby output of Digest::SHA1.digest('test') gives me a completely different output than crypto.createHash('sha1').update('test').digest(). Does anyone have experience with interoperable sha1 hashes / encodings of hashes? What I need at the end is the node.js equivalent of Base64::encode64(Digest::SHA1.digest(content)). content is the md5 of multipart request body + some other request parameters
