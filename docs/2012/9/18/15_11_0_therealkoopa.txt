If you have multiple workers, you'll have different clients connected to separate workers. If you emit a message using a memory store, it will only go to clients connected to that worker. If you are using a redisstore (or something similar), it will publish it to the redis pub/sub, which will be handled by all workers, so all clients will get the message.
