Hi guys, I noticed that a lot of uuid / guid generators in node rely strictly on the pseudo-random method of id generation, which can be problematic when scaling horizontally (the more hosts you have generating ids, the higher chance of id collisions). I made a node build of cuid. Any comments or criticisms?
