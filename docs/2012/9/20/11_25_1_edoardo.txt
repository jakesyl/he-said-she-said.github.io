Question: I created a server with the 'net' module which writes a stream of data to a UNIX socket - then I connected to it with another app using net.createClient. The amounts of data are big, and I noticed that the nodejs client process keeps growing in memory as it reads from the stream, till it exhausts system memory. Can I fix it??
