Anyone here use node-mongodb-native? I'm reading a file line by line and converting it to an object, then using collection.update() to store it, but when update is called it seems to keep everything in memory. I don't have near enough RAM to do all the files I need because of this, is there something or does someone have any ideas on how to fix this issue?
