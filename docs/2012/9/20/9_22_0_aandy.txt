hi, i'm parsing a small fire hose (that is, lot of random data -> my node script), and want to listen with regexes similar to Hubot. as per robot.coffee it simply iterates over a regex-based object array, letting the object flag a msg to mark "stop iterating". i'd really prefer to make it "regex with best fit". does anyone have any thoughts on this?
