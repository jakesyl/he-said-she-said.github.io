hi guys, I have a general js question, think I will just ask here: after overwriting the prototype property of a function, is it nesssary to reassign prototype.constructor? by not doing so, what code (other than directly accessing obj.constructor) might break? I thought instanceof might not work, but it turns out that's not the case.
