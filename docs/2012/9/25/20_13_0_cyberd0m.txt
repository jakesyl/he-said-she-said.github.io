Hihi, maybe someone can help me with mongodb. I'm simply trying to connect to it. It works from the shell (i.e. mongo localhost/test) but I can't connect from the node terminal. I try: require('mongodb').connect('mongodb://localhost/test', function(x) { console.log(x); }); It tells me: [Error: failed to connect to [localhost:27017]]
