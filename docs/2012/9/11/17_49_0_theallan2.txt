Hello all - I've got a bit of an odd one. I need to get the IP address of the remote client, but the socket object doesn't appear to have a 'remoteAddress' parameter like the documentation says it should. I've put a dump of my 'request' object (from http createServer) here: http://pastebin.com/wwSUzfyQ
