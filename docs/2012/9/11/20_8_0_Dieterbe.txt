addisonj: hmm that's correct. my problem is as follows: i want to process files as they appear on the filesystem (with https://github.com/crcn/node-watchr) as well as any existing files when my program starts (fs.readdir), to make sure i don't miss any file, i launch the inotify watchr first, and then do the fs.readfile, meaning there's a small timeframe where i could process the same file twice
