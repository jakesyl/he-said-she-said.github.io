Second: I might have listener leaks due to client-side server event registering. What I do is allow client-side callbacks to be registered to events on a server-side emitter. I do this using dnode. I asked here before whether this would leak, but didn't really get a definite answer. Will the callbacks registered to the emitter be garbage collected after the dnode connections close?
