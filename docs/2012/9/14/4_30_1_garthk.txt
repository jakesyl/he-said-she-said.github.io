I'm looking to refactor a lot of worker classes as streams. They're all pretty simple: they take data in, and occasionally spit data out. Is there some kind of StreamedWorker base class in a module somewhere that'll take care of all the back-pressure detail if you override work(inputdata) and call queueoutput(output data) as necessary?
