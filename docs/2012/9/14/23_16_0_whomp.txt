i am making an app, using the google maps api, that provides the user with data based on where they are zoomed in. the data is fetched whenever the user moves to a different geographical location. should i keep an open connection between each client and the server while the client is running the app, or should i open up a new connection each time the client needs new data and close it as soon as all the new data has been sent?
