I guess the thing that seems to drive me a little nutty lately is the framework hate that is goign around. Sure I can write vanilla.js but then I have to account for the 10,000 differece between IE 8-10, Firefox, Chrome and Safari. In an ideal world we should beable to use the language exactly the same across all browsers without having to write a shit ton of edge cases.
