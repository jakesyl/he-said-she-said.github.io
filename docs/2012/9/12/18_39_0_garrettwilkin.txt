though this seems more like a question than an answer -->  "socket.on('disconnect', function() {}) - fired when the socket disconnects? Not sure when exactly, i.e. will it only fire if client initiates disconnect or also if server initiates disconnect. Does it fire on unexpected network failure, or a mobile device losing connection?"
