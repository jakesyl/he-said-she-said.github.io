WarheadsSE: my employer has it's own datacenters. currently if i want to setup a typical website (2 servers + load balancer) i have to create tickets for creating cname, vips, wip, ACL, host names, etc. it's a long and annyoing process and involved a few ops people. is it possible to create something similar to AWS but internaly? simple web interface with a few buttons that will create those in minutes?
