I've been using Express and Connect for a long tim, but today sometimes went awfully wrong and I'm not able to track what's wrong. None of my POST requests aren't getting through. I've peppered my app, express and connect with `console.log`s and this is where the trail ends: https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/blob/master/lib/middleware/urlencoded.js#L61 neither the event "data" or "end" is triggered on `req`. Not sure what's wrong. Any ideas?
