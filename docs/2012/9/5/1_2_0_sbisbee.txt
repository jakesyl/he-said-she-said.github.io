Hey - Hopefully a qq: i'm creating a readable stream, keeping it in memory for a bit, and then trying to pipe it to a writable stream. Both streams are files. I've tried using resume/pause, but to no avail - I assume the data events are flying by before the pipe can be set up. Does this sound right?
