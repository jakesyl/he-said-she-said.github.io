hi! there's a phrase in the Module doc that i find quite strange: "Multiple calls to require('foo') may not cause the module code to be executed multiple times."   how exactly would 'foo's code be executed multiple times? i've always assumed 1-code inside the module file is run once 2-only the module.exports get cached.   any pointers? thank you
