Hi. Is thera a way to make a object (that's created by a callblack) public? So I have a connection to my sockets. (io.sockets.on('connection', sendToClient);) In that function I have an object called httpObject. I want to emit some other things to the io.sockets (aka the httpObject) but I can't acces it in an other callback. Can you help me? :P
