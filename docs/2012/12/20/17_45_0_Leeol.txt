mbalho: Using what, timers? That is what i was originally thinking to do, anytime the app starts simply check the time, and calculate the timer and set it off. For any dynamic destinations, you could always log the end point in case of failure, i was just unsure how likely Node/setTimeout will silently fail the timer. Vanish, with no way of knowing the timer needs to be restarted
