Has anyone here done networked multiplayer game programming with canvas and socket.io?  I've got a solid prototype of a multiplayer server + client engine working, but I'm having trouble debugging lag issues ( determining if they're client side or server side, etc. ) - looking for suggestions or good examples.  :)
