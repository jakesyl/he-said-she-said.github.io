othiym23: testing on dev mainly - used memwatch lib on dev to try to find some leaks, but it doesn't flag a leak ever (only flags if heap goes up over 5 GC rounds) .  On dev I fluctuate around 5 -10 MB memory usage on lower demand.  Currently no demand on production, but it's sitting at 735MB usage
