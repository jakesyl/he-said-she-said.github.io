anyone who've toyed with unity? i was just going over some Unity3D docs and a bit surprise at their lax definition of "javascript". anyone know if it's just to make javascript a pseudo typed language or if the differences go beyond that? (for instance, the var varName : somethingElse, seems to be type definition or inheritance, e.g. var test : String)
