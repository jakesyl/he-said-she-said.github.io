I have an application which is keeping track of "Rooms", "Users", and Sockets (from socket.io). For now, this will be a relatively low-activity application - maybe 20 Rooms and 20 Users concurrently. Right now I'm storing everything in memory... is that generally okay? Or should I go for some sort of persistance like Redis?
