I'm not sure if I understand client/server side rendering war. I was under the impression that creating a rest JSON only API was a good thing (backend seperate from frontend) meaning we can build clients for desktop browsers and mobile devices separately (native ios/android apps). However if the server was giving us html responses then this wouldn't be the case right?
