i need a way, to spawn httperf and grab its stdout/stderr by node, but not after httperf will done its job, i need to grab it 'live' - https://gist.github.com/14e0c91d723576cab0fb this code, can spawn 'traceroute' for example, and it works as expected, but for httperf it dumps whole output only at the end
