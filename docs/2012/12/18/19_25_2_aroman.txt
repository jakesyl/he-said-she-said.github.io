hey so there's this cool node module I use, and it's on npm. I forked it on github and added some features that I really could use in my project. Of course, I submitted a pull request/responded to existing bug reports for those features on the original project. Thing is though, I don't want to wait for the original author to merge my stuff in. How can I use my fork of the module in my production app via npm?
