In case my question got buried, just wanted to know if anyone has used a clustered "cron" type thing before. I've found kue, which seems like way more than I need, anyone know of a simple cron scheduler that will work in a cluster? We already have RabbitMQ, so if there is a way to do a delayed job with that, that would be good as well.
