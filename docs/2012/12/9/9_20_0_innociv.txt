I'm trying to get monit to kill node.js when it's using too much cpu.  Can someone help?  I have it set up like this: http://pastebin.com/7TbrJBvU when I run "monit status" it will monit it once, then stop it once when triggered to properly. The program will automatically restart(because of forever), but it no longer monitors it unless I change the process name in the config and restart monit.
