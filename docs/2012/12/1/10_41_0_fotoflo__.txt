hello   i am having a problem with mongoose. working on some already built code.  I have a user object and I've just added a "type" to the user in mongo db.  When I query the user object in the node debugger and type user.name  i get my user name, same works for other properties, but not for type… however when i type user._doc.type i get my user's type…  whats going on here?
