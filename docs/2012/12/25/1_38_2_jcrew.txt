i sold a guy a car about a year ago that his wife told him he couldn't have so he told me he'd just bring it back and i'd refund all of his money and we'd be gravy and when i told him "no" (mostly cause i bought a motorcycle with it) he asked me if i had ever been to court and that he'd take me there if i didn't refund his car
