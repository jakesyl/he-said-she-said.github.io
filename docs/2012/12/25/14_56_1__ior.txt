hi all, new to node and js in general here, and i'm wondering if anyone has any resources about how to design a good DAL... (fwiw i'm using brianc's node-postgres). i've got no problems with functionality, but i'm using the evented model atm and my on.row and on.end functions are getting to be this huge mash of if else clauses
