Hi friends. I'm trying to decide between python, ruby, or node.js for implmentation of an html5 game. For python I was considering Flask, Ruby Sinatra with EventMachine, and finally Node.js. I'm leaning towards Node.js since Flask doenst have good web sockets support. Was wondering on opinions about this?
