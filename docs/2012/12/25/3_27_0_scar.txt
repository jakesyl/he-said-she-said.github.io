if im using a script in PHP that would be much more efficient to run in javascript (ie, a tester that tests for # of images in a html document, etc), would it be more efficient to run it on node.js platform, or do it via web? i kinda dont wanna release the code i'll write in JS, and i think node.js lets me hide it
