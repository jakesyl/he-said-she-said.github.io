quick google and I don't think thats what im looking for, iterally what im looking for... its more about syntax then anything else. basically a grouping mechanism that works with raw json objects. For instance lets say I have a list with json objects [{classes=[]},{classes=[]}] , i would like the ability to go fn('.something').<selector function>
