quick query. experimenting with tcp sockets. i am connecting via telnet to node and trying to understand a bit about buffers / incoming data etc. when a new connection is opened the connection is created then immediately a small amount of data is sent. "????? ?????'?????????" im trying to ensure that data that doesnt come in whole is joined up later. what is this first bit of data i am receiving?
