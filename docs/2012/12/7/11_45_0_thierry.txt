Hi, I am setting up TCP communication between two servers, the first one sending requests to the second that will answer asynchronously. This is the very first time I am dealing with requests as low as TCP and I would appreciate greatly an article summing up the best practices, but I really can't find something like that, and maybe you can help me finding that. =)
