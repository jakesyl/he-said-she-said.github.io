I have a fairly lenghty (long-running) CLI that I'm getting an EventEmitter leak on.  Its coming from line 134 in realine.js, which is a `once()` binding on `self`.  In this case `self` is the `Interface` function.  Not sure how I can raise max listeners.. how to access the right object to set it on?
