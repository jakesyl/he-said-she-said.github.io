Ello. I just realized that for iterating over arrays that I could be using Array.forEach, but after some quick research, seems that on most browsers "for" outperforms "Array.forEach". The comparison didn't include Node, so it is perhaps not entirely applicable, but does anyone believe this is reason enough to continue to act like Array.forEach doesn't exist?
