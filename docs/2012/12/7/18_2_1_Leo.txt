For example.. if i have a module called user.js where users are loaded to buf from the db, i include user.js in a.js and b.js, a and b would each get a diferent instance of user.js correct? So if a change some 'user.propertie' in a.js it would not affect 'user.propertie' of b.js correct? is there anyway way to aproach this sharing the pointers?
