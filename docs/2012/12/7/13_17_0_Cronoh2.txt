i am new to node and working on my first application, if i wanted to create a website where players login, can have teams and comments/reviews and such, as well as a live chat and looking for group type system between users, would i do the entire thing using node (I want to) or just the chat system and lfg stuff and use my native language (php w/ Symfony2) for the backbone (users/teams)?
