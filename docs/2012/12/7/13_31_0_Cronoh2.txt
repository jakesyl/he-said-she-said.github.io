Erriond: Ok thanks for the info, i am making a test chat application right now using socket.io, node is freakin awesome, so im excited wasn't sure if i could somehow just use node to interact with my databases and do work, or if i should serve the pages using node like normal php pages, and seperately use node to run the chat and such as their own node server
