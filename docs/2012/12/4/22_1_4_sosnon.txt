i've asked this question before, but who cares: has someone used YUIDoc in larger node projects? what are your expriences? are there caveats? i haven't used it, but, by the looks of it, it is more versatile than JSDoc (@static, @extends, language neutrality, ...) - and it is better mentained than JSDoc; or am i mistaken?
