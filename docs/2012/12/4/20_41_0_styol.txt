Ello. Anybody know what the deal is with process.setMaxListeners(0); and whether or not it is a good/bad idea? It almost seems like one might want to increase them for more specific event emitters rather than everything in the process, but I'm not sure. Any info or opinions not easily gleaned from the docs would be great.
