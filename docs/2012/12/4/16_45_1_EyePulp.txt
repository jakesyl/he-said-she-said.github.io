so let's say I'm completely ignorant of how to do formalized testing (I assume that means unit tests, but again, ignorance) of a codebase.  I've got a node project, and am struggling with some debugging, and figure, hey, let's learn to write tests and improve our skills a bit. Any advice on how to learning the process?
