The main reason I ask is because while doing some relatively simple benchmarks with a concurrency level of 10, I've managed to reliably reproduce complete degradation of node's performance after 2 cycles of 1000 requests. Setting the max listeners of the process to unlimited made things magical again, but I'm not sure why and I like to understand magic.
