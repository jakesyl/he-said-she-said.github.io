what are good js documentation generators for larger projects (basic 'inline' documentation in comments + auto-generation of HTML/PDF/Markdown/... output)? maybe something that even recognizes modules/objects instead of just operating on files and functions? is there a special recommendation for node.js? things like jsDoc Tookit/docco/dox/jsduck all struggle a bit with those requirements
