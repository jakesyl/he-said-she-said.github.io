q: i've written a couchapp, but i'm not sure whether i should stick with that or just use couchdb for the db side of things but have the app side of things separate, i.e. just a node app that accesses couchdb, instead of a html/js app being served out of couchdb -- what are the advantages/disadvantages re performance?
