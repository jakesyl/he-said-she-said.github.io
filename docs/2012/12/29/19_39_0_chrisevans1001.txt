hi. i wonder if anyone can point me in the right direction. i am hoping to use node.js for a android/ios app that i have developed to allow very basic multiplayer. i don't believe i can use socket.io as i can't use the client in my code. therefore im using a regular socket to connect. my worry is, looking at others code, there appears to be things that i dont fully understand such as buffers.
