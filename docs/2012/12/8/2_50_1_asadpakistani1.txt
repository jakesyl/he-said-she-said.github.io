what i don't understand is. Lets say i increment a value in a document on one database. Then some internet user increments the value on another database. Now what I don't understand is will the document that was incremented the latest win...or will i get the sum of the increments. I obviously want the sum of the increments because both increments are individual modifications to the document.
