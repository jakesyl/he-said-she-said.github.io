I've narrowed down my issue a bit... has anyone heard of firefox making a reconnect, on disconnect?  I have a very absic chat application using socket.io, eveyrthing works but on firefox when i disconnect, it opens another connection (Which passes my validation) and disconnects right away, so when someone on FF leves, it looks like he double-left, any ideas?
