im having a hard time trying to figure out how to hook into the on connect event when using express framework?  I'm trying to deny all requests except on a single url, in every example i find they do this on the .createServer(function(request,result){ // here })  but this is taken over by express framework (I put express() in there instead) can someone pls give a noob some advice?
