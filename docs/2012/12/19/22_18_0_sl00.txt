Hi. I just created a test app with nodejs/mongodb to try different ways to get a group count on the different values of a key. Quickest is (to my surprise) distinct+count at ~500ms for 100000 documents (if I have an index). IMO it (group, aggregate and distinct+count) is very slow and I wonder if that is normal?
