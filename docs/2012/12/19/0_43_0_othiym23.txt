ec: the only times I haven't been able to step into function calls in node-inspector, it's either been because stepping goes off the end of the call stack in the event loop, the JIT is handing execution off to a native method or extension, or I'm trying to step into a standard ECMAScript function like Array.prototype.forEach()
