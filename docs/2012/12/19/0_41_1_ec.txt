I can't seem to reproduce it in a simple context; I spent most of yesterday stepping through the relevant code, and trying to reproduce the exact chain of events so I could post it here; but no luck. Outside of the extremely complex framework it occurs in, trying to reproduce the same steps doesn't have any of the issues.
