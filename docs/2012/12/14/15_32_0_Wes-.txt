Using EventEmitters like this:      socket.addListener("drain", socket.close);      safe?     Or should I be creating a temporary function to insure that the 'this' is 'socket' when the close method is invoked?    (I guess I'm confused about how 'this' works in Node EventEmitters -- I know it would not work with browser events!)
