substack: Say I have a few git repo's that I would like to use across the board in other repos, like a private library of helper functions or whatever. I'm using fleet to deploy some code but propagit or at least fleet's arguments to propagit deploy don't cover git submodules, I think. Is there any way to check out submodules on deploys?
