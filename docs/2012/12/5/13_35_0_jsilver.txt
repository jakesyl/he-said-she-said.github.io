sandfox: pretty much. there's a good drawing of it because it's complex, but Nexus, is the Master List Server program, that runs on Heroku, then there is GChatServ which can run on any Nix platform reasonably and MacRuby, which pings the Nexus that it's up, but I also have ServerDropper, a private project which drops the GChatServs (currently only the node ones cuz its efficient) on a linode and controls them.
