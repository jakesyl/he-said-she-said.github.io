bnoordhuis: please tell me how silly this is (goal is to allow a child process to inherit an fd, so that the fd can be manipulated with ioctl): parent opens a file, calls exec and passes fd in the `stdio` options hash. child runs `ls -al /proc/CHILD_FD/fd` yielding a mapping of fd:filename. The correct fd is chosen, then the child calls ioctl on that fd.
