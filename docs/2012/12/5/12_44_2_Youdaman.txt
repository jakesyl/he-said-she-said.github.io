garbagecollectio: if you're smarter than crockford that's cool, go write a book on js. if you prefer foo = {} to using new, that's fine. next time you ask a question i'm going to ask you why you're asking -- as in what is the point, because from what i've experienced today you're asking questions with no direction and wasting time -- both your own and everyone else who tries to help you
