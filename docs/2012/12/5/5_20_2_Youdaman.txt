i like JS because it's on the client and now on the server, i like Python becuase it just feels clean (and maybe i should do more CoffeeScript?), i like C++ because it's oldschool and yet pro re desktop and console apps/games -- i liked perl because it was the glue of the web, but i think js is now coming into that space, and doing the one language on both the client and server is a win
