chance: there is an api plugin for WP which i want to use to export some data. this plugin responds to requests with json, so it's kinda nice. another wp plugin makes a POST request to a specified url (this would be my nodejs script, listening to it), and when this happens I need to make further request through the aforementioned api to get all the data needed. after i got everything, i have to save this out
