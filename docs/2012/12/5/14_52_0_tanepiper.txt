daleharvey: cool :) yea works nice, I have two of them running just now - one 1000ms and, one 10ms ticks for a smooth animation and they work pretty well (although some weirdness when the device sleeps or the window looses focus - they keep working accuratly, but basically have to 'catch up' to the current time so you see them speed up a lot to catch up, then go normal again)
