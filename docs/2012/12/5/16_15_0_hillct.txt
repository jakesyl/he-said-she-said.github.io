konobi: it seems the only npm config option that would impact the bin path i 'prefix' but that impacts all other install paths as well, which makes it unsuitable. I guess I'll be adding it to my path, in it's current location. Can't get a way from the feeling that this is a poor practice. Never been a fad of adding application-specific bin paths to my pathâ€¦ oh well
