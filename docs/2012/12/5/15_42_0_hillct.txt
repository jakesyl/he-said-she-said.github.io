isaacs: I ran into an oddity when installing yeoman via nom -g. What determines the path where sgmlinks for executables are created? In my case. the install created links in /usr/local/share/bin rather than in a location that's in my path. This is certainly easily corrected in a one-off basis but I'm just trying to understand why that location was selected.
