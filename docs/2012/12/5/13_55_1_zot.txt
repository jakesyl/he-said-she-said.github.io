guor_: not sure what you meanâ€¦ my problem is this.  I have a Handle<Value>, in an Arguments array;  if there is a C++ type for Buffer, I would gladly cast to to that, and grab the underlying data buffer.  but I've not found that, so strings felt like the way to go.  (normal c++ strings can be coerced into this non-modifying behavior, iirc.)
