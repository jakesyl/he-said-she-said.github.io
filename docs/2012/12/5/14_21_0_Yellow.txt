sandfox:  well.. im learning... :) and might i add that i hate the sockjs/socket.io ".install()" method to wrap webserver request handlers (is it for that? why can't we wrap the request handlers directly?). What i'm doing now is trying to accomplish an elegant way of separating http requests from the others, inside a tcp connection handler.
