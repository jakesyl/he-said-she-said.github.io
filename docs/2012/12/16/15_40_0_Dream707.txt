hi. I have a question. Iâ€™m using Appjs SDK(which is node js plus CEF framework, so i have both client side and server side together) and in my module i need to use jQuery. i tried this https://gist.github.com/4306534 but it does not working(should print function but returns error with $ is not defined), what am i doing wrong?
