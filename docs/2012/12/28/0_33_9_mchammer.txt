hi! i am new to mongodb and have a question about storing large amounts of data via a nodejs-shell-script. on the client i have a data-scructure that looks like this: i've got a 2d-array of chunks (100x100) each chunk containing another 2d-array of  64 * 16 "tiles" and in each of tile some strings and numbers. what would be the best way to save this in mongodb?
