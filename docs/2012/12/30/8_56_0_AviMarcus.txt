mistertwig, no idea what to make of this re: rethinkdb: We no longer use a log-based approach. RethinkDB adjust for the underlying hardware - it's log-based on hardware that performs optimally on a log-structured workload, random for hardware that performs optimally on random workloads, and anywhere in between depending on the hardware system underneath.
