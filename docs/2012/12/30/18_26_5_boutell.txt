Is it considered bad practice to have singletons in an npm module? If my app installs npm modules a, b, and c and they all depend on module 'shared', nom is going to install three copies of 'shared' (note the main project does not depend on shared). Then 'require' will find different versions and any singletons in the module will get created over and over
