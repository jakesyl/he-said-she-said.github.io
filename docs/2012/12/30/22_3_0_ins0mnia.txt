having awkward issues with browserify's API when using it within a module I'm writing, it seems to always try to load the modules from the main project (node_modules instead of node_modules/myplugin/node_modules); when manually setting the path on each required module browserify includes the full path in the bundle (not relative) making the bundled module inaccessible
