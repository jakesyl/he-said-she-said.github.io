im new to the nosql game so when researching i was able ti witness mongo first becoming the beez knees and the perfect solution to everything and then everyone moving off of it, and then everyone hating it...  what gives?  after a few tests with node it seems awesome and fast and so much better than sql and i even like it better than redis after testing a few different scenarios in it
