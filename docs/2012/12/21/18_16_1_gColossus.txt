I am installing azure-cli using "sudo npm install azure-cli -g" with node v0.8.16 and npm v1.1.69. However, it failing due to an error related to git checkout "release-dec-2012" did not match any file(s) known to git. The complete log could be found here. Would anyone be able to look at it and give me some pointers? http://sprunge.us/EVEc
