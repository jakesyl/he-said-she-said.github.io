Say I have a VPS with one IP that I expect to run as many as 20-30  domains on (at some point). I'm not that good with linux server administration, so I don't know the correct policy of which user needs to run what. Right now I actually have my root user running the proxy (in nodejs) because I couldn't get my normal user run it.
