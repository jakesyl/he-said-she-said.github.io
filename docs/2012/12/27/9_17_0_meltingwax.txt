hi, interesting in trying out node.js. One thing I get tired of is ConcurrencyModificationExceptions from java, ie the whole data-structure-being-used-from-different-threads-deal. this is a question being asked before I know what my code wants to do, but are there any thoughts you give me about data structures and having a global state for a Server in node.js?
