so since there's fewer idle people than when i first asked, perhaps i may ask again: i'm pretty new to node and trying to get a file upload going with formidable. i have other things that need doing between server request and form handling, though, so for formidable i buffer chunks on data events, then in the handler, i removeAllListeners, declare my form.parse callback, and then pop data chunks and emit new data events
