I have read about it, especially the part that is regarding "sending private messages", but... suppose I am sending a message to an id "123", if somebody else can get holf of that id, wouldn't he be able to get his messages/notifications? also I thought that .emit is sort of public (streamed to everyone and then filtered out by events, defined on the client)
