substack: I'm starting to understand dnode a little bit more every day (excuse me if it's taking longer than the average for me to understand). However, I have a question for you (I'd figure I'd direct it at you because you're the one that created dnode, if that's alright). Is it pointless to have a d.on('remote') or d.on('local') if you already have a callback provided to dnode()?
