aandy: another question (feel free to ignore if u'r busy) about the usage of redis - when request comes, i insert it into redis, push to apple service and on success/failure I update the data in redis, right? and later on create a web interface that will query all the data in the 1..n redis dbs to view report or maybe retry the failures. does that make sense?
