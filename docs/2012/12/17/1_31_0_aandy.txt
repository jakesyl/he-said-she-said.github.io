similar to the "i just want to get started because i'm so excited". node is typically about smaller things to begin with. if you thought "i think node is cool 'cus it's realtime and stuff" maybe explore that further. if you wanted to learn node because it's new, explore some of the things that set it apart from regular web frameworks (not that node is just a web framework), etc, if you catch my drift
