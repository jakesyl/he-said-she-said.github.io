I have a design question that I think is probably bad to begin with. But let me run it by you. I have a system where there's a cache. the key to the cache is a number, the value is an object. cache misses are expensive (obtained via a web service call). The question is - how do i structure this? I need to use callbacks obviously, but I don't want to force my client code to write a callback
