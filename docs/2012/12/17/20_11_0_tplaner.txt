hi, I'm attempting to install npm via the command: "curl https://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh" -- and I keep getting the error "Error: EACCES, mkdir '/opt/local/lib/node_modules'" -- I've attempted to use the command as sudo as well with the same result -- is there an easy fix or should I try install via a different method?
