Why would this line: console.log(self.client_data[user], row, row.is_connecting, row['is_connecting']); print this output? http://pastebin.com/AkCxNrwK I just can't access row.is_connecting at all, comes out with undefined, yet I can see it's in the row object because that outputs correctly? I'm stumped, any ideas anyone.
