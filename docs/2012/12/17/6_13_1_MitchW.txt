otherwise, if you just want to poll every N seconds (very simple approach, but a bit more taxing than other options) that can work too.  the main downside I guess there is you're gonna be passing the same data back and forth a lot, and you'll have HTTP header overheads and the likes which may be much larger than the actual messages you're sending/receiving
