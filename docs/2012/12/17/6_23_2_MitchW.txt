kv1: yeah similar to client side js - except node also has a lot of non-blocking APIs, so you can call your DB request function, and node can queue that while it wait sfor the DB, and begin processing the next web request (and potentially complete it) before the DB response comes back and it resumes processing that request.  so race conditions and stuff are possible if your logic is tooooo complicated (but that's not often the case)
