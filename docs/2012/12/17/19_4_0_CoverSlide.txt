Slade-: from what I understand, Ember is very monolithic, but it's great for writing long-lived apps that stay open in the browser for hours at a time. It's also tied to the handlebars template system, which people may or may not like. backbone is fairly simple, but usually easier to develop one-shot pages that people are on only for a few minutes and go to a different page later
