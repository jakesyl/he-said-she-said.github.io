hey.  im having some issues setting up a private npm registry.  I've successfully replicated from http://isaacs.iriscouch.com/ and added a user, but when i try to publish it gets stuck in an infinite loop PUTing to the registry and receiving a 401.  When i try to GET the package couch gives me a not found.  Any ideas where I might start looking to figure out whats going on would be very welcome
