Hello everyone.  I've fallen in love with node.js's simple model and I'd like to try out some web development with it.  The problem is that I'm not much of a Linux sysadmin and I'm receiving some errors while I'm trying to build it.  I'm using CentOS 5.8.  I've downloaded node.js v0.8.16 source, unzipped it, and tried ./configure but it gives me the error " 1 if options.unsafe_optimizations else 0)".  Any ideas?
