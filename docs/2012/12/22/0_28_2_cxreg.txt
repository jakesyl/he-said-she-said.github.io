i have some code that appears to be eating an exception.  there's no try {} block that i can find, and although there is an uncaughtException handler (domain actually), it's not being fired.  the process does not exist.  the exception simply disappears.  any idea how to determine what happened to it?  i'm trying to instument TryCatch and FatalException but no luck so far
