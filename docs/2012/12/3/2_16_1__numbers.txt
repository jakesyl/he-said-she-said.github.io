othiym23: its just hard to make changes. like towerjs has a healthy number of depdendencies and sub-dependencies; duplicate versions of stylus for example are installed in like 15+ subdirectories. if you want to change one thing about stylus, its painful to do locally, and even more painful to distribute (e.g. to a nodejs dev team, or to a staging/production server)
