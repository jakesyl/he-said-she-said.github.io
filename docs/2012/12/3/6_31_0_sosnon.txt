i have a function 'getRandomData()' which does fs.reafFile(..., callback) where the data is only accessible from within the callback and i have io.socket.on(..., callback); how do i properly tretrieve the data and hand it over to another var in the io.socket.on callback; it looks like a callback standoff, but since i know there is no such thing, i assume there is a more rational solution, isn't there?
