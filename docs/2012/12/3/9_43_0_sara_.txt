I am using elastical plugin to index and unindex documents in elasticsearch. I am trying to unindex documents asynchronously in a loop calling client.delete to unindex document. While doing so, I am getting the following error -> (node) warning: possible EventEmitter memory leak detected. 11 listeners added. Use emitter.setMaxListeners() to increase limit. What possible causes there might be?
