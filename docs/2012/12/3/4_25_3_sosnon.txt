i'm running nodemon in my app's roto directory like this 'nodemon -w ./** app.js' and it works for app.js (./**.js seems to work for all js files); however, it does not cause a new request/push if static files change (of coursed); is there such a tool yet? something that issues the client to refresh automtically (by requesting the static files, maybe?)?
