I have a quick question, i'm trying to do an app with express and sockets, but now i want to load some external js files from the index.html file, but it says that the file doesn't exist, i have tried adding this line on the server with no luck: app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public'))); and created the .public folder
