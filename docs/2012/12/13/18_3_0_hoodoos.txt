just wonder how it works, you know sometimes there's a blocking tasks on eventloop so let's say i made request, set timeout to 20 and then other process comes and launches blocking task for 30 seconds. and let's assume that http request will process really quickly. so after eventloop returns to process and check timeout will it first check that it has all data needed or will simply callback timeout function?
