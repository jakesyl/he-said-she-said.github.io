Peter Moskovits did a presentation with some comparisons published recently.    a company based around the comet model shares these numbers.    50,000 users with a specific number of messages per second.    Their latency with their highest grade comet server takes around 700 milliseconds to push.    They did the same experiment with WebSockets with 20%-40% more users and it was around 4 milliseconds.
