TehShrike: substack said that, too, but I really want to pipe XML text in and get a stream of objects like { what: "start", tag: "X" } fragments out. Then I can hook up a nice long pipeline through filters and processors which operate on objects, and eventually have one spit buffers or strings out, and pipe it into a file, and have back-pressure work properly through the whole thing.
