managing dependencies in node is harder than ruby i guess because bundler makes a master list of all gems at various versions in a single ~/.rvm/gems/ruby*/bundler/gems/ directory. where npm scatters them throughout various ./node_module/ subdirectories. so if i just want to patch a certain version of a dependency in a large project, i have to do it in many places. but with bundler i only have to do it in one place.
