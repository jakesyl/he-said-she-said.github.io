Yeah, one of my tactics is to pre-filter it as it's downloaded, perhaps by parodying the machine from which it's pulled. That way I can throw out around 85% of it. That said, the final engine is still going to OOM or have to scan through it a lot more than seven times. My eventual goal is to replace it and generate the graphs in a smarter fashion.
