_numbers: I first picked up on it from the Python community, where Fredrik Lundh had a 1998 Jamie Zawinsky quote about regular expressions and two problems. Turns out Jamie, in turn, repurposed an old saw about people using 'sed'. It wouldn't surprise me at all if it goes back to mainframe days, or perhaps even mechanical engineering. http://regex.info/blog/2006-09-15/247
