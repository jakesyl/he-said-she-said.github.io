I'd like to write a command line app like vim that takes over the entire terminal buffer and doesn't scroll like a typical command line app would.  Does anyone have any good resources for learning how to do this?  I've googled, but I'm not finding anything.  I'm honestly not even sure what the term for that is which makes googling a bit hard.
