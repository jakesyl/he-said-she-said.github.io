manuelbieh, SomeoneWeird I've looked into grunt, and it seems nice, but also like an overkill for what I need. With jade I could do something like: `jade --watch *` and *.jade files would turn into *.html ones properly processed, always updated after each file-save. Isn't there such a CLI tool available for EJS, Mustache or something similar?
