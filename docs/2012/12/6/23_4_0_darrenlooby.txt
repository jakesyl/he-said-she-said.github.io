Sly... I'm still playing around with earlier... I don't want to be greedy (I don't think), as all things will be {{camelCase}}. The regex that I got working today, works grate... only it still returns the {{}} around the bit that I want... so, I'm currently doing .replace("{{","").replace("}}","")) to get rid of. Strikes me as not a good way of doing things, if I can rid myself of the {{}} in the first regex
