Hello guys. I'm not exactly new to node.js but I've only used it for local scripts (!). There are some things I don't understand. First, what's node.js's actual purpose? To serve static pages via http, in place of apache? And what's the right way of doing this? I've heard there's a little building you have to do before actually comparing to apache?
