Hi all, I'm using either Wachr or fs.watchFile to... well, watch a file. I'd like to come up with a single function that gets its content into a var, watches it and then updates it when changes occur. I'm wondering a) anyone know of tutorial or current module.. or b) how I should approach doing it... i.e. should I load first, or watch first and so on.
