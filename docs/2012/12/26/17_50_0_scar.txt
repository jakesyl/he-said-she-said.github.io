i have a PHP app that takes forever running, bc it grabs the source of a website and checks for stuff via regex for # of images, wheter the title exits, etc etc etc. it came to my attention that javascript is the easier way to do this, and more efficient. would this still be so if passing the js parsing load to Node.js (back to the server), instead of having the user/client run the code?
