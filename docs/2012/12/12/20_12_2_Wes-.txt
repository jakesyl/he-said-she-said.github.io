isaacs: Ah! Literally at the high level -- gotcha.  I happened to be buried in a "should I do a shared-read/copy-on-write" implementation on ByteThings right now, to get down to zero-copy from the network stack to the JS object.. So, you know how that goes, what you're working on affects your perception of what's going on around you. :)
