i may not know much but this is what i understood from just reading about it. 1. if you have 10 servers with the exact same stock express app running on port whatever ..the load balancer will just pick one server for each request. 2. if you use the cluster api from nodejs you have basically the same app spawned in multiple workers and they share the connection and they listen to the same port
