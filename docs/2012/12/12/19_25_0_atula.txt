hello. I am using Express and Socket.IO and I know that I could use cookie session to remember stuff.  However, in my case, it's quite simple.  I have some play/pause button in the client and when I emit the "play" state, I want a variable on the server to remember that play=true and vice versa.  Do I need to use session here or can I just do a var is_playing = false; and change it in the socket on event?
