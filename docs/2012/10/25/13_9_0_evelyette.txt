I want to setup clustering with nodejs, but I'm not entirely sure whether the following works as expected: I want to have 4 nodejs (distributed over 4 separate systems over WAN) and I want to use socket.io with my game ... the problem is that I need to connect two players together, but i'm not sure whether I can do that if one player is connected to node1 and the other to node3 ?
