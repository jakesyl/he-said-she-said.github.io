I need some expert adviceâ€¦ I have a web service which makes a request to itself. Imagine you have a web service for a user (/user) and you want to create a new web service for a user that returns just a subset of the data (let's call it /user/minimal) and that makes a request to /group/minimal which then in trun makes a request to /group. If I hit the the /user/minimal in the browser everything works fine. If I hit it with siege it hangs.
