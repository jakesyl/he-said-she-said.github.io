so i'm totally new to node.js, but i was hoping to figure out how to dive in. i love javascript and the thought of embedded inline serverside javascript is something I find very intriguing. but am I correct that node.js is actually a platform for writing webservers itself, e.g. something competing with apache? in other words, it's not something competing with, say, PHP or what have you?
