Well, I'm trying to add user auth to my node.js app that comms thru socket.io. And it seems to be a huge pain in the arse to do sessions over https over socket.io. And it's even harder if I want to avoid tools that I don't understand (yet) and that might complicate things in the future (connect & express). Steep learning curve for a newbie.
