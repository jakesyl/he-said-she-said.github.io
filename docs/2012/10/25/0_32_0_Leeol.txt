ChrisPartridge: Well i wasn't so much asking for help with this, but more for debugging tools to see what is not closed. I can't reproduce the error at all so i'm having trouble pinning it down.. i was hoping Nodejs had some advanced debugging options that would list out how many different event branches it has, and which one hasn't returned.. or something
