Hi, when I use "Content-Type: application/json" as my HTTP request header  field, server listening at port 3000 (created using node.js) doesn't recognize "Content-Type" as a valid header field.  "Content-type" in place of "Content-Type" as my HTTP request header  field makes things work fine. Is there a difference between "Content-Type" and "Content-type" with node.js?
