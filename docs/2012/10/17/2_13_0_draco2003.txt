looking to abstract out the calculations in StatsD, but there is concerns about the calculations blocking. Is this sufficient to do https://github.com/draco2003/statsd/blob/c341f969e34d664700c900d80e50ed959504dc05/stats.js#L74 ? or would something like https://gist.github.com/3903315 be better/worse?
