is the no module to mkfifo ? I have worked out my app needs to create two fifos, and export these as env variables, then start the application i need to run, it will connect its stdin/out one to each. Then i send my data to the stdin fifo of the program and get the response back on the stdout, after which the program closes and the fifos can be removed
