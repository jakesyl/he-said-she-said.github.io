Sup guys, I've been battling with this problem earlier and I've not found a solid solution for it just yet. The problem is that I'm supposed to run a server-side function from client side on POST submit, but I would need to wait for the function to run before the actual POST is made. Adding a onsubmit parameter to form seem to not work either. Any ideas?
