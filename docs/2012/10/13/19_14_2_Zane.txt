context: okay, more specific then. I am using the Node+OAuth library in my API to make requests to  Facebook, Twitter, etc. Sometimes these requests take >10sec. When several are open at once, sometimes I cannot connect to my node.js app server at all. I have inserted a console.log in the very first line of express middleware, and it is not called.
