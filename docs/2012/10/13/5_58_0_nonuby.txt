if I send 100mbits/sec of UDP datagrams to a IP that will go via gateway which reachable via eth0 and eth0 is set at 10mbit full duplex, are the packets (or 90% of them) just discarded, and at what layer does this happen? i.e. does the kernel handle this? or can I query the physical nic for dropped packets?
