Hey i am trying to use node.js and three.js together. I need a http server to make some components of three.js work. But i am unsuccessful. I first tried to create a normal http server and try to send a static webpage. But I think all the dependent js and image files are not sent properly. I changed to use conenct framework and was still unsuccessful. Do any of you know what the problem is?
