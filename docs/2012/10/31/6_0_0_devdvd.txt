Hi all.  messing around with the cluster module of node.js and when i try to spin it up i get a bunch of "Error: getaddrinfo ENOENT" messages (4 of them to be exact cuz i have 4 cores in a vmware vm running gentoo with kernel 3.2.12) here is the paste of my code http://pastebin.com/73jtmhFw  i just pulled the example from the nodejs.org api docs so i might be missing something
