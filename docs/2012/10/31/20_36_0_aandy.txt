i'm an odd fish. i don't support 100% freedom, and i don't like patents/gpl gibberish. if you can create something great, by all means keep it to yourself. you made it, your reward. if you share your findings to get feedback from a (large) community, like open source/publish on github, then your IP is pretty much lost, as it should be. quiquid pro quo.
