EyePulp: I'm currently writing a webapp that is entirely working with an api. I'm currently thinking about having 2 servers. 1 in node that streams the api, stores stuff into the database and emits events through socket io to the client. The other (rails) would be for the "frontend". Not sure if this is approach is good.
