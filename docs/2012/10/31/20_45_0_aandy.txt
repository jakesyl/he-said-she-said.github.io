bradleymeck: btw, if you remember i asked you for assistance on some login/session setup not too long ago. i went with ip/ua + session id, and i don't invalidate sessions if they don't match, but send the "attacker" to /login. is that how you're suppose to do (if i'm trying to protect users from hijacking)?
