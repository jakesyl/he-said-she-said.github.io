so I understand the general strategy for dev-> production deployment of node projects is to include the node_modules with your repo, so you don't depend on package availability for deployment.  However, is there a strategy for the compiled bits and pieces to make sure those get built/rebuilt on production? And should I be ignoring certain directories?
