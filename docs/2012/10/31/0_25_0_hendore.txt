I'm not sure how this should really be done, kind of a design question here. I have 2 models (actor and movie), the movie model has an array of actors (the cast) and a method to add an actor. Should I also do the reverse on the actor such as an array of movies with a method to add the actor to a movie object? only problem is I can see this leading to a circular dependency
