let's say i want to create a web app (browser and mobile), that has a lot of forms. those forms are complicated, i.e. form validations are interdependent etc. since i have to write a lot of js to do the client side logic, i thought it might be cool to use the same parts on the server side. my question is: how do i go about that?
