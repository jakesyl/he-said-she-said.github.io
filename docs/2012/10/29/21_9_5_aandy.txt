i wasn't arguing for or against it, i was just saying it works great for what i need on this app, and the fact that i can put ssl on top of it without going through stud, nginx or similar only sweetens the deal. haven't used a stable version of haproxy, it's that new, so can't really benchmark yet. but compared to the nginx https response on comparable pages it's fine
