hey guys. i'd like to write a library that where i concat this file (https://github.com/Wolfy87/EventEmitter/blob/master/EventEmitter.js) into my own file and build some features on top of it. but in an AMD setting, the above file doesn't expose itself nicelyâ€¦ how would I reference it later in the file?
