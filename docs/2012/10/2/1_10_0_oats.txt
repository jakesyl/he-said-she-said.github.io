Hey, so I'd like to start write my first node.js application form scratch, preferably a very simple todo list sort of thing. Any suggestions on where to start? I've found a few tutorials using frameworks, but I'd rather build the server from scratch so I truly understand whats going on before choosing a framework to work with. I've already The Node Beginner Book by Manuel Kiessling, so that is the extent of my Node.js knowledge.
