jesusabdullah: Dart, Groovy, Python, i dunno, I am not happy with things. Either language is great, and platform sucks, or language sucks, and platform is great. Dart is close to having both for me, but its still in infancy. Groovy is nice, but comes with teh Java baggage, Python is decent, and well rounded, but gets blah. Ruby meh.
