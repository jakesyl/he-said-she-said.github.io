question about global installs.  i'm on a ubuntu system and i tried doing a global package install but when i try requiring it from a node script it is not found.  i could SWEAR this worked in the past.  i tried changing my NODE_PATH to /usr/local/lib/node_modules.  it works, but now node can't find any of the standard modules!  what's going on here?
