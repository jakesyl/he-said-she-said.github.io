i'm creating some unit tests using assert and i'm wondering what the best strategy is for running these tests as a suite.  i have multiple files, each testing a different module.  should i just have start up node and eval them each?  i'd rather do it in node than like a shell script since it's more portable that way.  any thoughts on this?
