hey, i have a "weird" task. i have this program which only takes a file as an input (no pipe, stdin) seemingly because it needs to seek the file (but i know for a fact that it doesn't). any way i can "stream" data to a virtual file? i know the size beforehand, and i'm able to throttle the program (so my feeding is faster than it's reading). or is it not possible without some sort of userspace filesystem?
