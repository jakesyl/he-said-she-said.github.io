hey, simple question, i'm serving an html page from a template (STATIC template), which has <link href="stylesheet/stylesheets/bootstrap.css" rel="stylesheet"> in it. But it doesnt work, not when i try to access: http://localhost:3000/stylesheet/stylesheets/bootstrap.css , the files are there (i verified the __dirname gives the right path and all), can that be some node.js permissions thingie?
