Good evening all. I'm running into an issue with bodyParser/Formidable where after writing my uploaded image file, Formidable gives up http://pastebin.com/fvkJfSKv due to an improperly formatted body, but I need to be able to see what's been uploaded. What event do I need to hook onto so I can at least log the body content?
