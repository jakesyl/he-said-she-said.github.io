_schulte_: we're talking about a few different things. if you want to use require('my-package') in any node app you can either publish the package to npm and include the package name in package.json or define the git url in package.json. Both of these things will put the package into the projects node_modules folder when you "npm install". If the module just isn't working because of C++ bindings that's a different issue that i can't help with right
