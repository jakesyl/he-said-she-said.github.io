I am trying to keep an array updated across multiple computers. What is the best way to do this? I would like as much to be managed by the library as possible. Now.js seems to be what I want are there alternatives? It is for a playlist where one computer is the master and the others can alter the playlist (add songs to the playlist, etc)
