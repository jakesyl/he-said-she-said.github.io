hello everybody! I'm trying to setup Etherpad lite on a IIS server with IISNode (and later I plan on uploading it to Azure), but when I visit the local site, I get this error: http://pastebin.com/4rZWbqix Also, if I run it from start.bat, it works fine, but since I plan on uploading it to Azure that's not much of an option. Any ideas?
