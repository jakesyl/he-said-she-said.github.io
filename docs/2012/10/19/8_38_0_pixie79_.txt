i have gone for a slightly different approach, I am not reading the data in from the tcp socket and pushing it on to an array, however when the data sent in is 'END' (being the whole line of text) then it should terminate adding to the array and output it to console, it seems to never match END though, any ideas ? -> https://gist.github.com/3916977
