Anyone know of a nice way to do fixtures for mongodb databases? I've tried just sticking them into JSON files but when you need to reference to different collections through objectID's then you need those Id's generated, so you end up with a dependancy tree of fixtures in order of which needs to be inserted first (to fetch the id).
