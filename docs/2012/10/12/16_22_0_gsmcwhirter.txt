I have a question about the best way to do something: I have a file that will be written to by an external program more-or-less continually. I want to write a node program to read the file updates and do stuff. Is there a way to create a ReadableStream that will just wait for more data, or should I be using something like fs.watcher to detect the writes and then read bits manually every time?
