elliottcable: arms for home defense should (imho) be excluded. handguns otoh, i think it's reasonable to outlaw within city limits. those have limited value and require ongoing training in order to be effective. most ppl (again imho) are too lax in their training, i wouldn't want them keeping handguns under their pillow and escalating a simple break-in.
