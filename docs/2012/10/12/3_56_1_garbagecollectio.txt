Even if this can be acceptable in a web browser, IMHO it is not when dealing with server-side processes. In my case, I've been forced to suddenly stop my work (an experiment with real-time web) with node.js because it cannot handle more than ~140K websockets concurrent connections (and my target is quite higher).
