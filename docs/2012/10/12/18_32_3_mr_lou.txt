mbalho, Well mostly Firefox, which is where I've set the default background to black. But I also use Chrome and Opera, in which the default background is white. Whenever I stumble across a website where the background is not set by stylesheet, it uses the default background. It's not a common "issue" really. But it wouldn't hurt to set a background-color: white; in the API pages.
