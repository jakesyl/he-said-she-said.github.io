isaacs: i have 35 npm modules, many of which are interlinked. basically, what i'm doing is iterating over all of them and for each) removing the node_modules; npm install; npm link. Then, once done, i go back into each on and remove all modules in each module's npm_modules that is a just-linked module. then i do npm install --link to link them all together
