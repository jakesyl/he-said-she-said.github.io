hi all - i am having a problem i think with syncronisity, when reading from a file and passing its contents via a callback onto other functions -> https://github.com/pixie79/npm-drbd-metrics/blob/master/lib/drbdProc currently line 7 seems to be undefined and so passes that to line 9 - any ideas how to change that around to work ?
