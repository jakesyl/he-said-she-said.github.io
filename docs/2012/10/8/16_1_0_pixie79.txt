i seem to be getting a bit of a json issue, if output my script results as it, then i get all the records, https://gist.github.com/3853259 -> however if i do json.parse(data) then i can output console.log(data.drbd.drbdversion) however I can not call data.drbd.drbd0.state as it returns undefined - any ideas ?
