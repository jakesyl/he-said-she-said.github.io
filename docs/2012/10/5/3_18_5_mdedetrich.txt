In mathematics and computer science, currying is the technique of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments (or an n-tuple of arguments) in such a way that it can be called as a chain of functions each with a single argument (partial application). It was originated by Moses Sch√∂nfinkel[1] and later re-discovered by Haskell Curry.[2][not specific enough to verify] Because of this, some say it would be more correct to name
