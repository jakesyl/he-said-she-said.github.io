I have a question about environment handling in node.js (development, test and production). I'm using nconf and sequelize and both of them seem to assume that there is only one enviroment. for example, sequelize's migrations read from config/config.json (this file path is hard coded in sequelize) and it completely ignores NODE_ENV. what am I missing here? what should be my approach to make sure that when tests run they don't muck around with development data?
