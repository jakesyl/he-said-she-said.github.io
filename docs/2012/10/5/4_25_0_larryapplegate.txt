  I am using the Apple sample code SimpleURLConnections to try and upload test images to node-formidable, using upload.js in the example folder. I get this response - Error: parser error, 0 of 22900 bytes parsed. The header is 158 bytes, the file is 22570 bytes, and the trailer 172 bytes, adding up to 22900. I can watch the IOS app send the correct file data. So I am guessing that the header is wrong. Any suggestions?
