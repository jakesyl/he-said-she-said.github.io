just watching the NodeJS 0.2 -> 0.3 roadmap lecture, about copying strings out of V8 to send them over the net vs. getting a pointer to the string directly. did that work out since then? also, should i try and store static parts of my web templates in Buffers and write them to the socket directly, instead of building up strings and sending them?
