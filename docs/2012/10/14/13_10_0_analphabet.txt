pyrotechnick: Suppose, I'm connecting to my database and this fails (then it maybe outputs an error, but it won't exit, because i don't want it to exit). Now, a request comes in and my app queries the database (aka <Model>.find), but it's like the requested  document doesn't exist, since mongoose doesn't tell me, it's disconnected / issues an error.
