if anyone's looking for something to build, I have this idea for a friendly botnet for startups to use. the startup peeps get all their friends to install the client & set it up w/their credentials for different sites (social/HN/reddit/etc) and then the client rountinely connects to the C&C server for directions, ie. share post X, upvote submission Y, retweet Z
