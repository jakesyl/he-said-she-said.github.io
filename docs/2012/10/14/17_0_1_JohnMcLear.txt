imho meteor tries to hard to be a full application development stack and forgets how important middleware is.  But hey, Meteor essentially came from Appjet and the lead on the project(david) really sees a real time application stack as being something that is useful.  I'm just more keen on developers developing application stacks that are specific to their application/user feature requirements.
