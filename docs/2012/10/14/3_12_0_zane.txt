My node app appears to be slowing down over time, eventually blocking such that it sometimes does not even accept incoming requests. Is it safe to assume this is a memory related error? If so, what's a good way to debug? I've tried getting a heap snapshot with nodetime but it doesn't work for me :( I can't seem to find where my code is blocking and/or running out of memory...
