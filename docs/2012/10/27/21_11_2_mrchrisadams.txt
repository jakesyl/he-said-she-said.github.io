hi guys, I'm having a really hard time working out how to use mocha, should and node redis together to write extremely simple coder to wrap a few calls to node-redis's  fetching functions in a User object. What is the obvious thing that I'm doing wrong here in this gist, to not get an object returned how I'd expect?
