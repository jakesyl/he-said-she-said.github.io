shripadk: step by step. I had an index.html. I set up a static server. then I set up passport for auth. then I added dnode. everything works fine untill this point. now I would like to write code with dnode or similar which then reads the session cookie, sends it back to the server through websockets or whatever I am using and checks if this cookie is still connected to a live session, or it's expired or
