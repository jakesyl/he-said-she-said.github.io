substack: actually, my problem is much more modest. I am pretty sure I have conceptional issues mostly. I have a static server which I don't want to change, so I don't want to conditionnaly send different data through that. I would like to be able to send back through dnode the session cookie name and check if the session is still alive, that's all.
