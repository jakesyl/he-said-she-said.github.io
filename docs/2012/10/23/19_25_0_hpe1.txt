What I'm doing is making a realtime tracking app. A call to '../count/ios/ will increment the counter after I do the call, but I also need it to fetch data from the DB when I load the page. So I figured: make a route app.get('/', ..) route and emit tracking data fetched from the database. I'm a total node.js/socket.io/express noob btw.
