hi, i use csrf protection (and serve over https), but i'm wondering about best practice for what to store in cookies. my sole purpose, initially, is to authenticate/hold session, that's it. some simple examples have trivial cookies like: name=<username>, but i've also seen people talk about useragent+ip+whatnot. any tips? my thought was to store something like a session id, but dunno if that's "enough"?
