visnup, I'm sure that the randomness like that should be fine.  my question is mainly what should I do with the token?  Right now I'm storing the token in redis as the key and the user_id as the value and then setting that to expire in x days.  To verify I just retrieve the user_id by the token/key and then activate the user.  Is this enough? Or are there better best practices?
