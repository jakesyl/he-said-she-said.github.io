Hey, I am doing mutlipart uploads to S3, whereby I have a buffer, on data received add to the buffer, then if the buffer is over 5MB upload it, reset the buffer string and continue. However, the download is a lot quicker than the upload, so I get ~10 uploading buffers at once, and I am getting a socket hang up issue (presumably because I have lots of connections to s3)
