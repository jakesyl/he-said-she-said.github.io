not sure if this is the best place to ask native node questions, but I always get a "Trap abort" problem when I call pthread_mutex_lock in the thread pool, even if the mutex is my own.  anyone know why this might be?  also, if i call fs.readFileSync() beforehand in node, it also causes some weird locking issues
