Ok, I think I might have been on the wrong track here.  My node processes are able to do 250 req/s serving 1MB files. (they do 260 req/s when serving 5KB files, so that's in line with what I would expect)  But earlier today I had my node processes completely fall over while serving 20 req/s.  Could it be due to really slow clients downloading slowly and holding open too many connections?
