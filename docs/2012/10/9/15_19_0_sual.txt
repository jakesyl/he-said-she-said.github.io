Forgive me if this sounds dumb but I'm new to server-client deal, trying to add some basic multiplayer functionality to my game (turn based so it doesnt have to be fast).  I want it to work across all mobile browsers and even EI8,  my question is,  Does node.js support these browsers and is socket.io in anyway related to nodejs?
