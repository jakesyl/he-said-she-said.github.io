well, i got a bit further and i managed to access all the data in my JSON store, but i am now trying to use async.parallel to bring them all togeather so that i can return the result to the calling script however, it seems to only be replying with the first result, then setting the string to undefined and returning that, if i leave in line 38 i can see i have all the correct results though - any ideas ? https://github.com/pixie79/npm-drbd-metrics/blo
