i feel stupid asking this:  In node + express, how do I pass a library reference to an app router that's in another file?  in my main app.js I create a reference to a library, and all my route functions need to call different methods on this library - the lib itself is stateless, so should I just include it in EVERY route?  Each time I create it, I have to read a config file and set some config variables, so that seems "heavy"
