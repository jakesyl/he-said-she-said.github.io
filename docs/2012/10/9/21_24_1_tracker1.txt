Hey.. I'm wanting to process a fairly large XML file in Node... does anyone have an example that I can follow that reads a stream, and selects a segment at a time?  <root><sub><node>....</node><node>...</node>...</sub></root>  as an example... mainly want to get each <node /> segment as a string, so that I can process it individually, without huge memory use.
