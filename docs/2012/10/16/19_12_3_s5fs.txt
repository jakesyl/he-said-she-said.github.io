eindoofus: if you want detailed tutorials, screencasts, etc then go rails. it's got a lot larger community behind it and more hand-holding for new users. node is a bit more rough-and-ready, still pretty new and you have to be a bit more of a self-started. i think node folks are the hardier of the two groups, but i'm clearly biased.
