jefffan24: I'm about 75% done with a deep read and have less than 2hrs invested. understanding with node core provides helps immensely when you start looking at modules. knowing where a module starts and core stops is very important (imho). also, it helps to keep things in perspective, most modules provide a ton of functionality but if you were forced to write it yourself, it's totally possible (because node code is pretty darned good already)
