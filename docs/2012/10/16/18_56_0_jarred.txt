I'm not very familiar with the Node.js ecosystem, but I'm familiar with Ruby/Ruby on Rails' ecosystem. I need to make a Node.js app that has a JSON API, an ORM, and some kind of background jobs similar to delayed_job. What would be a good combination of packages/tools to do this? (or a single framework?)
