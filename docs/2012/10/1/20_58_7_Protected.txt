Hey people. I'm trying to post a string to a remote server via http using the http package and code like what's in the docs for the http request method. The correct remote location receives the request, and I can return stuff from it, however the actual string being posted doesn't seem to arrive there. Is there anything I must set on the node side in order to enable sending the body, or
