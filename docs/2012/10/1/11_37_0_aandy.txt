a bit off topic: i know it's a gray area, but with crawling (saving 3 pieces of information that are widely public, and not "authored" by any particular source), i'd be able to have an okay defence against cease and desist (not hosted in the US) or worse legal action, when i'm using different sources to get the facts, right? say i have 3 sources where the info is available, randomly checking one or the other should be "ok"? any thoughts?
