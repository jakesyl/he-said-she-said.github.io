Can someone explain to me how/if this is possible with nodejs? There's a lot of chat about it but i'm not exactly sure if it's meant to solve my problem. I want to trigger a server request that returns information to 5 categories. Seeing as it could take some time to process, i'd like the 5 categories to be updates asynchronously, so the data updates the view whenever that category's info is ready. Is this possible?
