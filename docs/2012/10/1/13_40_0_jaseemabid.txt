superjoe, I have read that. I have written quite some node stuff. Like apps, hubot, express.js websites etc. Its my calculator since a long rime. repl comes as a quick js checker. I use it for mocha, jslint... Now, I am building a git wrapper in js with v8 in c++. Now i am wondering what exactly did node do? I have a repl here I made myself in like 20- 30 lines of c++, i might be albe to evaluate  a js file with c++ and v8 alone with another 20 more
