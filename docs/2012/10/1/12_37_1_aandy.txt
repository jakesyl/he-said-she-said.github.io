Bren_: do you happen to know about press releases? reading http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:FAQ/Copyright says without explicit permission can't be reproduced, but doesn't specifically mention derivative work. here i'm thinking more about citing though (as in, Source: Company X Press Release # y)
