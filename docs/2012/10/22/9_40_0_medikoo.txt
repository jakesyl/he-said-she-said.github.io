gavin_huang: that's what I thought ;) ..but think about it, also mind that Webmake was made also with kind of obsession for pureness: it provides smallest footprint possible (nothing to compare with Browserify).. and doesn't change a single character in your modules code. Additionally with source maps feature you even see your modules as separate files in browser console, so as if browser would directly support modules
