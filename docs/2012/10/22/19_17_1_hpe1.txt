Stupid question coming up: I've created a realtime tracking site which updates a counter if a certain url is accessed (e.g. www.site.com/track/ios/). Now, the counters update fine on my HTML-page works fine, except for the fact that it is not populated with data from the database when it is loaded. How do I do this? Do I have to use app.get('/', ..) to render the HTML page to get it working?
