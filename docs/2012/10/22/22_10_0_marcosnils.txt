Hi there, I'm trying to profile a nodejs application with Dtrace and sackvis to get the famous flamgraph. However, for what I've read, the only way to do that is by using an Illumos based system such as SmartOs. Does anyone know if there's a pre-installed image somewhere I can use to download and start profiling without installing SmartOs and compiling node myself?. Thx
