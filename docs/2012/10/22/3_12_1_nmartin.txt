I'm just curious at this point, so forgive me for asking, but are you trying to do something like: Recieve a http request for /somepage/.  your /somepage/ router needs to something, then send the response to that browser request, you send an html response, but inline a block of code, say jquery.js as you send it, vs sending just a client side <script src='blah.js'>?
