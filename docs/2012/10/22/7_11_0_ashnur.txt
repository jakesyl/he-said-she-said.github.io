RLa: maybe we are not talking about the same thing. I know a lot of solutions for loading apps. My problems come that I can't setup a production environment on debian with node. If I had at least one script I could be sure it will allways run, I could then implement any kind of api for loading any kind of apps. But I don't have such a thing.
