gavin_huang: the nearest you can get is Webmake: https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake it also provides like require shim, but it's just 50 lines of code to manage require logic, nothing extra. What your asking (trimmed out requires) would possible with next version, bus still in development it's best to port code exactly as it is in files, without additional processing.
