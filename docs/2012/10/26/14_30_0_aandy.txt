hi, i have a "working" login test http://pastebin.com/d8aRru8Q but with a cookie expire/maxAge problem which i can't specify. not sure if it's express.session, RedisStore or passport. req.session.cookie is updated correctly when the session is used (time reset), and also in RedisStore, however the browser (Chrome) still keeps the old expires/maxAge. any ideas how i can debug this?
