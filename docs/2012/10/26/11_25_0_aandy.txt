hi, i've recently begun using express.session() (with connect-redis, but that's not important). it works as it should with defining and expiring sessions after maxAge, but i'm wondering... aren't I suppose to update the session maxAge when the session is used? e.g. i have maxAge set to 10mins, so 10 mins later the session stops working, even if the user actively makes requests using this session up until 9-10 mins.  surely i'm not suppose to save user/pw i
