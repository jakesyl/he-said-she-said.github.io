isaacs: BTW - I did a little testing with `npm ls` - it doesn't seem to do what we want it to without a bit of extra work, including us parsing package.json versions, and comparing to the json output.  What we really are looking for is a simple way to determine if any of the listed packages in package.json are a) out of date (old version), b) not installed and exit cleanly before breaking in weird ways
