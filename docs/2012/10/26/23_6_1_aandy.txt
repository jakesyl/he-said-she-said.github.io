my point of "simple" was just that there's some intution to the fact that you shouldn't sudo node to port (whichever), being that, if you lose control, your app has access to everything. imagine a stackoverflow or bad stringconcat parsing, resulting in a shell "rm -r /usr". if your process is sudo'ed, then chances are you're not going to like the result :)
