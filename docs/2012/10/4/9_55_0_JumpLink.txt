I have more than one webservices on my server, at the moment I use nginx to manage my different domains to forward the domain-request to my nodejs apps which each has his own port.  Is it possible to configure my nodejs-service that it responds to a defined domain (not only to a separate port) without nginx or apache as an intermediate layer?
