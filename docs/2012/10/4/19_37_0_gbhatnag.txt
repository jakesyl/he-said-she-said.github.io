niggler: familiar with phantomjs? I'm trying to get it running within my existing mocha tests. I've installed it (downloaded from their site, placed /bin in my path as well as done an npm install phantomjs), but doing a require('webpage').create() fails b/c 'webpage' module can't be found -- am I missing something?
