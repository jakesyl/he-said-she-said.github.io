hi y'all - looking for a testing module that can act as a browser and log in to make authenticated requests to our server. We're using cookie/session-based auth - any modules out there I should look into? Currently using mocha + superagent + should for testing. I've heard good things about phantomjs, but can't seem to find docs on its support for sessions...
