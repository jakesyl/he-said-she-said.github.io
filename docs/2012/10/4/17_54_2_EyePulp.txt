baudehlo: We run postfix currently and it reads via tcp from a redis list to do redirects for some 20k different addresses - I think we're getting a couple million messages a day to relay, but I'd have to check.  I'm looking for a nice way to get some deeper inspection/logging functionality in line w/o having to do more work in postfix
