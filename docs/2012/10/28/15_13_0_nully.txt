So it's not enough that javascript exploits roam the internet. Oh no, we gotta allow servers to recive and process the same nasty code on that turns the clients into zombies on our servers. Node.js: Allowing non-programmers to write exploitable code. And leaving SysAdmins to constatnly clean up the mess. Good work, great project. I hope you kill many sysadmins with stress.
