Hi - just wondering if I could get some opinions. I originally used to solely develop apps and handle the data server side (like most people). But more and more, my apps are moving to Javascript controllers (stored in /public) and polling an express-based REST service for data. All of my old being is shouting at me about 'compatibility'. It got me wondering, just how compatible with browsers/systems is this method?
