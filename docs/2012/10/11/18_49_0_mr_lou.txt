Complete noob here. Been reading a bit about Node.js for the first time today. (Trying to find a replacement for PHP, and Node.js seems like it might be it?). I've been searching for some time, and I might just be really stupid, but there's one thing I can't find: What does the javascript source "compile" into? What kind of server is required? Sorry for the noob question.
