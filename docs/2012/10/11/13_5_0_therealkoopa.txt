I need some recommendations on streaming. With all the latest hype, I want to try doing things the right way with streams. I am building a service that hits different rest endpoints. Each function returns the stream, so I can use JSONStream or whatever with it. I want to also cache the response in redis. Does it make sense to continue to do this with streams? Stream the response into redis and into the JSONStream?
