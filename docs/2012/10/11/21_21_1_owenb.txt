Many modules claim to be streaming or have the word 'stream' in their name but aren't at all (I know I am 100% guilty of that with the current version of SocketStream!). So a thought: Would it be worth supporting something like 'streaming':true in package.json so we quickly find modules that just do one thing which we can pipe() data into?
