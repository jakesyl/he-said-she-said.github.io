pyrotechnick, by how noisy they are: lolllll.... you lose *far* more energy at the power plant than you do in the kettle. the kettle noise is a very small amount of energy, even if you include 60 seconds of steam pouring out of the spout. of course many types of power plants harness energy that cannot be delivered to your home directly, i'm really only comparing it to fossil fuel plants
