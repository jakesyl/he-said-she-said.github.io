hi, i'm looking for a micro framework in node to automate the creation of JSON-ish, RESTful-ish, CRUD-ish webservices. Based on a schema description (kind of like mongoose ?) var Product = new Schema({title: { type: String, required: true }... who would generate all the crud for me get put post delete ... do you have any knowledge of such project please ?
