paradoxquine I think I got it. So when v8/node was running the method that had these event emitters (i.e. adding the listener), it was immediately executing the doSomeWork function in that particular listener, since I was referring to the function as a function call (`doSomeWork()`) rather than a reference (`doSomeWork`)
