medikoo, i would recommend against keeping module source code in your repository. instead create a script that can install modules of particular versions, and another to check the versions of modules. then create a config file that is tracked by your repo which has the modules and their versions. this allows you more flexibility and decreases revision control system bloat which can be a huge PITA
