dax_roc, awesome :) i enjoyed doing that kind of work. that job was my first experience with microcontroller programming. i got to use an MSP430 which was fun to work with and had lots of features with a thick datasheet. i also had to use a Telit, which was fun because it was a GSM modem, but not so fun because it had a bunch of poorly designed features
