dax_roc, i believe ^z is not a character sent to stdin when it sends a signal. like ^c, it is out of band. your tty driver is supposed to catch the input. it never gets into the pipe/buffer to the process. it becomes a signal immediately. but in your case, you're actually writing to an AT modem... what sort of modem device is on the other end?
