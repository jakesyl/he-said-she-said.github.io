Well, actually the *exact* situation I was trying, was this: I have a website, I set up Node.JS, and I got it running, serving up the webpages, then, after doing the Node Beginner's book, I decided I wanted to do a simple project of this: when a user enters in a "query" for "body" and sets it equal to something, it takes whatever "body" is equal to, and sets the background color of the site to that...
