isaacs: I'm trying to understand the nom distribution of the architect package. It seems when installed via NPM it doesn't include the contents of the plugins directory, but via git clone it does. The package.json file doesn't shed any light on this behavior. Is there something I'm missing in the behavior of nom and deletion or other special file handling?
