if i need strong typing and a great debugger ... i go to C# and ASP.net MVC ... if I want speed and lots of prebuilt crap with little cruft and I don't care too much about hacking on it to make it work ... Ruby + Rails .... I need something fast easy and that I can write and deploy in less than an hour ... node + express
