Raynos: so i added require("live-reload")(9090) as the last line of my server.js file (got an express app there). i also run from the terminal: node_modules/live-reload/bin/reload.js --uri=localhost --port=9090    i added test file to the root folder of my express. what should i expect? nothing happened. i see 'live relead server running'
