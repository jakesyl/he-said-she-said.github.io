I'm new to node and have a control flow riddle. A browser will ask node to do a series of ops: search sth in db, verify, maybe update, return result. It's a series of ops, so sounds like Step or Async would be good, but it can take various paths, depending on conditions, so doing Step(fn1, fn2, fn3) is not good enough. How do I avoid a complete mess?
