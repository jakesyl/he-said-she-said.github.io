Hi, I'm playing with node.js for the 1st time. I'm having a small problem, I'm doing an https.request in a function in order to check some headers and return them, but outside when I use that data it seems that it's done async with the result of not having that data yet. Is there a way to wait until the request has finished / doing it sync?
