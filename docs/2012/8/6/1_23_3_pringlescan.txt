Does it make sense to do string processing (looping over large arrays of data, checking if one array contains an item) async? Or will only I/O tasks (not CPU bound ones) benefit from doing so… since it will all run on one thread/core I'm guessing it doesn't help to use callbacks for these functions… rather just to return the result?
