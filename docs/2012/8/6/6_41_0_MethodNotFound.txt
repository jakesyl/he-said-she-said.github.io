It was a joke from work, an older woman I worked with decided my johnson must be the size of a pringle's can because how else could somebody who wasn't tall, didn't know sports and was a computer geek got with so many ladies. So she said "It must be like a Pringle's can!"â€¦ it's not, but it's been my handle on IRC ever since.
