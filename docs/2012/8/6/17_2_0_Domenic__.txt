piscisaureus: it's just another thing that makes writing cross-platform node code hard i guess. Like crashing on process.guid.toString() and erroring on domain sockets with non-crazy names and so on. I end up submitting a lot of pull requests that are just try/catch or ifs or whatever because nobody tests on Windows. And in my ideal world they wouldn't have to test on Windows.
