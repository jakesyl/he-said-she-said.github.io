bradleymeck understood. I'm doing something a bit untraditional though. I'm mem caching json endpoints from an admin, and that admin hits recache endpoints to my front end sites to recache said endpoints. It's passively storing only when things have changed rather than hitting the admin server every request. That make sense?
