samholmes: you could fork this https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/blob/master/package.json and replace the contextify dependency version with "https://github.com/Benvie/contextify/tarball/master", then fork the other modules respectively all the way down if you don't want to do the dirty approach with zip/move folders etc
