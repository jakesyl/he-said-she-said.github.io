That's wild… I'm trying to find first and last names in business names to figure out if they're "doing business as" their names… I was able to match 50% of last names using census data. I went on Wikipedia and grabbed the common last name suffixes and made a regular expression and that matched over 50% of the names that weren't matched by the census list.
