SHA-1 isn't the secure algorithm that we'd like either but there's no attacks against it that would make PBKDF2-SHA-1 insecure that I know. SHA-1 suffers from a length-extension attack, which isn't relevant to PBKDF2, and if there's a collision, that introduces a chosen-plaintext attack, which also doesn't affect PBKDF2
