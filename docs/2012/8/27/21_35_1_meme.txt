k, now i got into trouble. I have installed node with chris lea ppa, ub10.04. i had to install npm with apt-get install npm, as it didn't came with node. the install created a folder "npm", in my ~folder, along with a tmp folder(i installed few times node, and never noticed these npm and tmp folder). well, then i installed nginx and i had problems with permissions, by accident i used sudo chmod -R u+rwX,go+rX,go-w ~ . so i messed with those folde
