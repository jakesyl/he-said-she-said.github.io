basically, what's going on here is that the main thread is handling a lot of incoming data (twitter garbage, ~3000msgs/sec), and i just need to hand that off to other processes to process, as if i do it in the main process, it goes ~100% and then i start falling behind on tweets since i can't process at the speed they're coming in, ultimately getting disconnected
