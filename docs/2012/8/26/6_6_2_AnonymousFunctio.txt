PHP has many problems, but I would say that the quality of example code out on the internet has held it back more than pushed it forward.  I love PHP... quick and dirty for getting most jobs done. Trying to hire a decent PHP coder is impossible, as they are incredibly rare.  Most have no understanding of OOP basics.
