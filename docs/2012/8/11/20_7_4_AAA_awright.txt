tjholowaychuk: Also, a ton of people depend on jade, you should probably release version 1... A while ago I complained you changed the behavior of #{expr} without a major version bump. Version zero is cheap and says there's no semantics and I'm not going to inform you that my latest release breaks everything. When there's multiple other people using a library you that really shouldn't happen.
