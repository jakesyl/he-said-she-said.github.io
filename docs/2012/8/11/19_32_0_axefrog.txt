Got a quick question about jade, if anyone's an expert - is it possible to define something in a child view which is passed to the parent in multiple places? For example, I'd like the view to define a title and have the layout use that title in the title tag and the h1 tag. Would prefer to do it in the view, rather than the controller, if possible.
