ok one other question about jade - when a view extends a layout, is it possible to define a variable for use in different blocks? i.e. I am specifying content for a header block and for a body block, but the block internals seem completely unaware of anything declare outside of them, which makes it hard to define something at the top of the view to be used in multiple places
