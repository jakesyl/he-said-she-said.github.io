does anyone know of an MD5 digest implementation of file fingerprinting as a cache busting strategy? I've created a simple naive implementation in my fork of express-cdn, but I still need to add in memory caching to prevent unnecessary recalcs and I'd like to look at someone else's implementaiton if one already exists
