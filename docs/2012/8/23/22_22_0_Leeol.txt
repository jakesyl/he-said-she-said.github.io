I'm honestly not sure how i will deal with that. When writing my own resolver, i think i will need to iterate up the directory chain looking for `../node_modules/foo/package.json`,  `../../node_modules/foo/package.json`, and if i find one i'll need to open up package.json and look for the `main` value
