I setup node.js to pull from redis via pub sub, and then broadcast via socket.io. The problem is that sometimes it gets 2+ pub sub messages really quickly and broadcasts them one at a time. This means that on the browser side, the xhr-polling ends after the first one, and attempts to reconnect, but then misses the second event because it's reconnecting and it was broadcast during the reconnect
