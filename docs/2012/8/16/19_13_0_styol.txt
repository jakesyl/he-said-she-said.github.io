In the past I established that iterating over a large dataset using "for" caused blocking, so, I adopted a strategy that looped to the next iteration on process.nextTick. I've just noticed that it appears to iterate relatively slowly, approximately 1-2 seconds for each iteration. While this may indicate that something within each iteration is slow, if that is not the case, is this potentially indicative of a larger issue with the complexity of the appl
