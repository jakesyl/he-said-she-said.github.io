okay, so for my use case, i'm making a module with data for the USA, it has zip code -> coordinates, bordering states, distance functions, area codes -> coordinates, USPS abbreviations, street designators, cities, counties, field validation etc. all native in javascript. you could use it to store them in a database, but the object here is to use the data in a bunch of my data mining modules w/o duplicating it a million places.
