RLa: yes, normally I do make notes for everything I discover. have a huge directory of .txt files full of stuff I've figured out. but this computer vision thing was just a few hours of curious looking, wasn't really for a real project and didn't think I'd ever need to know it again. Guess I was wrong :)
