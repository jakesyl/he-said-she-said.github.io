I have a basic question about node.js (in relation to how it works with mongodb, but this is just a node.js question). I have a function like this: collectionref.count({foo:"bar"}, function (err, amount) {console.log(amount)}) ; ...My database connection is good. I've been inserting records in a similar function, but nothing is showing up on my console log when i do this.
