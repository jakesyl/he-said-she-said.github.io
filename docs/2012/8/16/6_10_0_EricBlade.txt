I've got a variable size JSON data stream coming in, which could be a potentially unlimited size array.  When the service sending it to me sends more than approximately 200 elements, I start getting OOM errors thanks to my node being run under memory constraints.  SO, I thought I'd see if anyone maybe has any ideas about parsing a monster string down into individual array elements, and then handling them on a much smaller scale.
