sorry for newbie q's but why/how would I use something like express instead of plack/django/plone to add apps and minimal cms like functionality (uploading etc) to an existing site?  Can node/express/(whatever) handle authentication and user admin or work with an upstream proxy like apache/nginx that handles that?
