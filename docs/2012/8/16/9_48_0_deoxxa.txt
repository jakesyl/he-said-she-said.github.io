i'm setting up a simple restful service where when you POST to / the content is analysed and an id is generated, where that id is always the same for the same content. if the content doesn't already exist on the server, 201 is returned with a location header that tells you where it was put. if the content does already exist, it seems incorrect to return 201, but 200 probably shouldn't have a location header. is 302 correct in this case?
