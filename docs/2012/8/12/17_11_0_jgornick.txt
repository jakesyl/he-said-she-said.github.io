stephank: i know i'm speaking out of line here, but i think the message i was trying to express is why isn't the registry given more attention? it's been down a few times in the past few weeks and there doesn't seem to be a contingency plan when it is down. i know everything is still very new too, but npm is packaged with node and has been for a little while, which makes it even more important.
