Domenic: Hmm. I consider that a feature... you can choose what you need. For example, on iOS, you can't play audio unless the .play() call is inside the callstack triggered by a user interaction. An asynchronously resolved promise would pull it out of the callstack and make it impossible to play audio with a promise API
