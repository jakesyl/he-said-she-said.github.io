I wonder if there is an editor supporting the following workflow: write some code and as you write it, send it to an active REPL, then execute lines in the REPL in order to test the sent code and after you're done with that export the part of the REPL buffer which was written manually for testing to a new unit test file (which you will further edit to make it a complete functional unit test)
