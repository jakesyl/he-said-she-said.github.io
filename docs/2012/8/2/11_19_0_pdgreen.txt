I'm writing some code that needs to search through the file system, but I feel like my approach is wrong.  In order to make things asyncronous, I have create a really like change of callbacks.  Essentially a new callback is added for every file that is searched.  That seems wrong to me.  Is a there a simpler approach?  With this approach, isn't it possible to run out of stackspace.
