"This version also features a revamped http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface. Instead of a static http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toolbar, items are accessed via cascading menus from the right of the screen, resulting in more screen real-estate for SimCity itself, without sacrificing functionality."
