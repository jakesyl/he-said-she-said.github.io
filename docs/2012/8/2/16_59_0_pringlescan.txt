AndreasMadsen, I use the CSV module, which isn't very slow, but I'd like to have the minimum number of dependencies. If V8 precompiles regular expressions it may be faster than split. I'm more concerned with memory utilization, I need to make sure this is garbage collected, it'd be a waste to keep it in memory
