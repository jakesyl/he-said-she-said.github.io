ekryski: you can build node for arm without having to edit files. instead of editing common.gypi, just do (for pandaboard) `export GYP_DEFINES="armv7%=1 arm_neon=1"` instead. also you can just export your own CCFLAGS and CXXFLAGS instead of editing SConstruct. lastly, you don't need libssl* anymore :-)
