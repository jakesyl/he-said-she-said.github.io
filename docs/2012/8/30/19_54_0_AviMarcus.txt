I'm using the package "request" to login to a site and post to retrieve some data from my account. How do I save the file? myResult.pipe(fs.createWriteStream("cdr-"+argv.s+'.zip'));  is creating the file with some information, but inside is blank. I know in the browser the request takes 3-9 seconds, but node.js finishes right away. I tried seting timeout:20000 but that seemed to have no affect. suggestions?
