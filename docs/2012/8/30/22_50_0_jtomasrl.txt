i need to make a string shorter, so i encrypt it, i need to send it over an HTTP request and grab it on the server side. I use crypto module to cipher the text using aes-256 algorithm, the hash im getting looks like this vPHnRlpc7mgEnPOCFFl+/MVk2vfthOwz7xI6ocuMwQA= but when grabbing it from the client side, the "+/" get escapped so i get a blank space inside of the hash
