hi, I'm trying to write a node app, that communicates with multiple slaves on an RS-485 half duplex serial bus. the problem is: every time the the master "polls" a slave, he has to wait for an answer (since its half duplex). these polls will be event driven. is there any nice (non blocking) mechanism to "queue" these polls?
