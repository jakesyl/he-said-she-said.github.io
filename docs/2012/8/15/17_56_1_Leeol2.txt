AAA_awright:  What i am trying to avoid is the Mocha way. I, like you, dislike "magic" variables. I just want a rough feature parity, and one of those features is not having to have cryptic variable names `a.b(...)` or 10 lines in every test file defining everything locally `foo = d.foo; bar = d.bar` etc
