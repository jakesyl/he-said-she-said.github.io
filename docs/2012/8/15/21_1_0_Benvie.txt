TooTallNate: I spend some time with ref and ref-struct over the last few days since i've been doing a bunch of win32 api ffi stuff. It's probably a bit too much to be pulled in but you might find some of it interesting https://github.com/Benvie/gyp/commit/800287c6c77303bb50668b8b89513edb2e1cec6a https://github.com/Benvie/ref-struct/commit/fc29fa1af947517ff7272790a048d92cac776505
