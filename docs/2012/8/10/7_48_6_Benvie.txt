I can't tell you exactly because I haven't use this library. But what I can tell you is that the error you saw indicates that a loop is being caused where a function ends up calling itself in the same stack. And in this code I see some wankery with lengths that could likely explain it, where you keep attempting to do a task that ends up at the same starting point
