k, people, i do understand the issue now to drop privileges for the root user in the app. in the end of the article, there's a resume of the code. question, if i was to implement that code in a express app, would i have to modify that code? how complex would be? i'm just starting with networking programming, so i'm not into use my time so much with configuration.
