css @media question for iphone 4. when viewing bootstrap's site's "responsive section" it shows that the "phone" viewport is showing in mobile safari on iphone 4. My question is that the device-width is 980px of "physical pixels" as sent to device-width in the meta tag. how does bootstrap's css determine that it is in the "phone visibility" class still?
