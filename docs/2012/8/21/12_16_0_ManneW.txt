stephank_w: Yeah, sticky sessions would be preferable. But just to make things clear, each web socket connection doesn't occupy a port each on the server? Not like each client first makes a connection to a shared port, say 80, but after that is delegated to its own (for the actual web socket messaging)? :-)
