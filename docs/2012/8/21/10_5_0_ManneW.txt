Hi! We're doing some research before starting with Node.js and WebSockets (using SockJS) "for real". When load balancing WebSockets, for example using HAProxy, will each client occupy a port on the server running HAProxy for the duration of the session? Which would imply that the theoretical max number of (WS) clients for a single HAProxy node would be the number of available ports. Just to get things right from the start :-)
