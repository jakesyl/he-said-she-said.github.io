is there a way to set up some kind of stream between the client and the server? Instead of loading a set of JSON data which can be searched in real-time on the front-end, and instead of making an ajax request for the data as the typing is occurring, what if you could just hook up somekind of stream and as the typing occurs the data is loading in real-time.
