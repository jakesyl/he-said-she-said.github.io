technodrome, yeah i've been pretty much a .net developer through and through for SEVERAL years. Definitely aware of how MS ties you into its tech for the "cool stuff" - but considering this is a web api (hitting a database of course) ... i dont see where be tied to MS stuff is a problem.... but you mention nodejs is a lot lower level...why do you say that?
