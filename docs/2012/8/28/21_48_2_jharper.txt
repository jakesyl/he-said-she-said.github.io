Hi, I'm new to Node and trying to use it to write a server which must be listening for incoming UDP connections while processing data.  At the end of each round of data processing, it must insert data which has arrived through the connections since the last round.  What's the preferred way of dealing with processing data while concurrently listening for incoming data in Node?
