if i have a package cloned from a repo, and i can successfully run `npm install && sudo npm link`, and is shows the file was linked at `/usr/bin/myPackage -> /usr/lib/node_modules/myPackage/bin/myPackage`, why would it then fail when running the 'myPackage' command by saying: "Error: Cannot find module '../lib/myPackage'" ?
