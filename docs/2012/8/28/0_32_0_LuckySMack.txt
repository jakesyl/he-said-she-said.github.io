anyone in here use/maintain hook.io? I am getting this error when installing on windows: C:\Program Files (x86)\nodejs\node_modules\hook.io\node_modules\weak\build\weakref.vcxproj(1,643): error MSB4019: The imported project "C:\Microsoft.Cpp.Default.props" was not found. Confirm that the path in the <Import> declaration is correct, and that the file exists on disk.
