is there anyone using https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever ? i installed, went to my app folder, and inserted the command: forever start -l forever.log -o out.log -e err.log app.js. everything went fine, but then i did forever stop app.js, then when i tried to restart, i got errors, such as error:   log file /home/meme/.forever/forever.log exists. Use the -a or --append option to append log. what one should do to restart properlly forever?
