I want to host several applications on the same server. Since they all can't listen on port 80, I've read that I need some kind of router/load balancer in front of the applications to redirect traffic to the appropriate servers, based on the requested domain. What should I use for this? I've heard HAProxy, Ngix, (Varnish?)
