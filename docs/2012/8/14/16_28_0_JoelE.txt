I've been trying to install node on my server. I have node 6.12 working from debian sid, but I can't get npm working with that. When I try to compile node 8.whatever it crashes my apache. I tried downloading the pre-compiled linux binaries and running those. That hung my server, and I had to remotely power cycle it. I really just need to run node.js with socket.io, and I am open to any solutions. Any ideas?
