anyone got any experience with forward proxies? I'm trying to create a local forward proxy server with node.js that forwards an https request from my browser through a remote proxy server (that requires authorization). http works, but the https bit doesn't work when I try to involve a remote proxy. https://gist.github.com/3353609
