hello ... any nodistas here familiar with how the R console works?  It has a neat way of browsing through the documentation in the console and/or by controlling a web browser to load web based version of local copy of the docs ... elisp/perl/python modes in Emacs have similar feature.  Anything like that for node?  can I put something in .nodrec like  require("help") so the REPL will help me :)
