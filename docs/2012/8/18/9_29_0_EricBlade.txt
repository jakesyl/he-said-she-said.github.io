hmm. dumb question possibly.  I note that in modern versions of node, i can create a buffer simply by doing var x = Buffer("blah") .. but apparently older versions required var x = new Buffer("blah") ..  functionally, I can do that even in modern versions, without incurring some kind of major penalty, or the wrath of the elder gods, right?
