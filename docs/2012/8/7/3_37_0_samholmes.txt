If I'm developing on localhost and deploying to a VPS, how can I maintain the proper domain in absolute URLs? When my application sends emails from localhost, the absolute URLs should be http://localhost/route/, while in production it should be http://mydomain.com/route. How can I make my app flexible enough to know where it's being hosted without me needing to change the source code everytime I switch domains?
