serdem: it is with great sadness that i inform you that you appear to be fundamentally retarded. perhaps due to a nasty fall as a child, perhaps due to some kind of incident where you were deprived of oxygen for an extended period of time. i'm not sure, and i'm not here to judge. but i do think that your disability is going to make it hard to grasp the abstract concepts related to computer programming.
