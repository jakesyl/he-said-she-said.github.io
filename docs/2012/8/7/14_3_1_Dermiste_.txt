Hello :) Yeh so basically, I have an array, with 3 objects in it, at in dex 0 1 2. Using a flash socket, I send through the socket either 0 1 or 2, and based on that, I want to work on one of my three objects on the node.js side. BUT, even if my console log for example "2" there is no way I can get my object at index 2 in my array
