hello all, sorry this is such a vague one: I'm getting 'incomplete startup packet' in my postgres logs when doing pg.connect(conString, function(err, client) { console.log('\n connected....') }); and I can't figure out for the life of me what has gone wrong… I don't think I've changed anything that should be effecting this (haven't touched conString) and as you can see it's a very simple query…. just wanted to rule out anything obvious
