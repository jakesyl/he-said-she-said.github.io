I'm not entirely sure how to ask this question properly, but can anyone think of a way to deal with registering callbacks? The main problem is that a single "handler" or callback is set and receives all the responses for requests. I'm basically trying to create an abstraction layer for a module/driver that allows inline callbacks to be used. IE: get('key', function(err, value){});
