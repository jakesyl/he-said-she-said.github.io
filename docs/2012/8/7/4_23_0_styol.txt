Nexxy: I believe I understand what you are saying but the problem is I'm not capable of doing that presently and more specifically is what I'm working my way up towards. The present implementation doesn't have inline callbacks and I would like them to. IE get('key'); /* no callback, response is sent to ambigous single handler */ versus get('key', function(err, value) { /* this capability needs to be added */ });
