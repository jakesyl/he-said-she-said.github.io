bradleymeck: the whole point, is that marak refused to accept what he did was wrong, he will not even acknowledge it. he rages and rants at the original author, throws insults like a small child.... a bigger man would just accept it, apologise and move on. he brought the whole thing upon himself. no wonder people remember and hold it against him, he's acting like an asshole!
