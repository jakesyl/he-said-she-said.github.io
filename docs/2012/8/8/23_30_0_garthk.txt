Sigh. Not sure I can stand more bouncy+mux-demux debugging today. So, alternatives: I need A to take web service API requests and pass them to B, who then hits the correct web service to get the results. The trick is that A is not allowed to open connections to B. Instead, B has to connect to A. What shall I try this time?
