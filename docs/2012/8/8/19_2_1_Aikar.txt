so does anyone see any flaws with haraka with a plugin that uses https://github.com/mscdex/node-imap/ and does ImapConnection.append(newincomingmessage) to Gmail? Basically forward my mail to Gmail w/o an actual relay, so that SPF records arnt checked. but im guessing this might bypass Gmail spam filters :/
