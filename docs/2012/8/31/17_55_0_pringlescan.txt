I'm making a nanp-utils module that gives all sorts of helpful functions for working with north american numbering plan phone numbersâ€¦ I'm wondering if I should make a constructor that takes a phone number so you can use it like phone.toCoords() (returns lat/lng for the phone number passed to the constructor) or if I should just expose those methods and take a phone number each time. Is one considered more right than the other?
