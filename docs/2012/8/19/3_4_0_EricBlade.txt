ok, so, i've mostly got the basics of the code i've been working on working, however, i'm running into a problem where when i put this program on the device that it's supposed to run on (a webos touchpad), the server that i'm talking to doesn't appear to be getting the things that i send, or it's receiving something different than what i'm sending when i run it on my pc.  this is frustrating.
