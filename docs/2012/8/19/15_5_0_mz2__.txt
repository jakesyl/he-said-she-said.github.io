the issue i have with gzip compressed request bodies is that i can't get the data passed intact from the req.on('data', …) callbacks that pass a string object and not 'raw' bytes that i could pass for a streaming decompressor, or concatenate to a bigger buffer that would get decompressed on req.on('end', …) . http 1.1 defines an accepted content-encoding "gzip" but req.setEncoding isn't aware of it
