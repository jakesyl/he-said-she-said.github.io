AnonymousFunctio: well, i'm not entirely certain how.  i just ran the exact same code on 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6.  on 0.4, the server that i'm talking to fails to respond as expected. on 0.2 and 0.6, it responds exactly as it should.  dumping the buffer that i'm sending out, it appears identical in all three cases
