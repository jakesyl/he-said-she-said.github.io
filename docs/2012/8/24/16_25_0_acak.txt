I am trying to recommend a Node version which can be used in production to my teammates. It's first use case is going to compilation of coffee script :-] but we'll add a couple of apps over the weekend. I really don't want it to any bad rap initially. Which version should I be using? Any ideas? (Based on my research, my options are 0.6.17 + or 0.8.8 + )
