I need to do: if(thread[0].exists), however in some cases thread=[], which causes an error ofc. Im looking for an elegant way of handling this, so that i could basically just do if(x(thread[0].exists)), where x returns false in all cases except in the case where thread[0].exists actually is set and has the value true. Can that be done?
