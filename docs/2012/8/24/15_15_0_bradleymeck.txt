diverdude, async.waterfall executes all the functions in the first argument to it (an array of functions) it will grab the err from the callbacks those functions and if it is truthy bail out, otherwise continue to the next with the arguments sent to the callback (if you think of the next(..) style of function for next(a, b, c) b and c will propagate to the next function in the array)
