hello. I'm deplying node in a vps. i know the recommend way to do, is with nginx as a proxy, but i want to go step by step, as this is a low traffic site, and go without nginx for now. I have node installed and an express app running on www.mydomain.com:3000/ . how can i make the app show at www.domain.com and omit the port?
