I am interested in getting large amounts of data from web API's into a servers database. I want to do this in the background not browser facing. I've done this using AJAX and it's not pretty but it gets the job done. With AJAX i've made it possible to include loading bars for large processes be show to the user.  I am wondering how I can do this on the server using exec, does one have a folder in their app that is meant for non-web
