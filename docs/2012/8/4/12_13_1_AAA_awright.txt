dominictarr: I'd have to do some work on the theory but it seems like one would want to plot based on, did the country just get lucky, or did they prove their performance? With just one metal, that doesn't demonstrate a whole lot. It means you're not at the very bottom, maybe, that you stood a chance, but could you get two metals? It's a huge margin of error
