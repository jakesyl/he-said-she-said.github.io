hey there. anyone good with using the child_process.exec function? i want to use it to pass the output from a shell script to a JS variable, but it seems like when i use return in the callback function, it wont do anything, and if i use it afterwards, then the return value is undefined, and the callbackfunction seems to run "too Fast" O.o... so, how do i pass the stdout of a shell script into a JS var?
