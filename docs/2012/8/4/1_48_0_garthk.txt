Zooming out: the goal is to carefully traverse a firewall. I want an internal node instance to open an HTTPS connection to an external node. Then, when my servers hit the external node I want the request to be sanity-checked, passed down to the internal node, sanity-checked again, then routed to one or more target servers depending on the request.
