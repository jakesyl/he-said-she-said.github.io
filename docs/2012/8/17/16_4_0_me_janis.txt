hi, i want to write a module to access a microcontroller using a large commandset, there are 20 "set-functions" and nearly 20 "get-functions". (to get an understanding)â€¦ so i wrote a json file specifying the name and corresponding datatype of each function. now i want the module to export all these functions, without implementing them in the module. is there any possibility to do that?
