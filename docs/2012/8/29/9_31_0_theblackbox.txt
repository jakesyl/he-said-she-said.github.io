hello all, I'm trying to set up a Backbone Model hierarchy utilising inheritance and Backbone-relational, but I'm getting an error in my test case when I make a second new object('Error: Cannot instantiate more than one Backbone.RelationalModel with the same id per type!')â€¦. I suspect I'm getting muddled between what is doing what and could use a pointer if anyone isn't too busy? http://pastebin.ca/2198940
