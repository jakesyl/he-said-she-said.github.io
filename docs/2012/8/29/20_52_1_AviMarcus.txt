Hey. I have a large list of dates.. that I sometimes want to walk in order, but sometimes want to just grab a certain date. Is there any suggestions for how to store it? If I do it as an object I can make keys of the date, but then I need "traverse" to walk it. If I do it as an array and sort it.. how do I find the date I want?
