I'm not sure, the way Stitch.js gets around this problem seems easier. Just give it an array of dependencies and they get added to the bundle. Maybe I'm just trying to use browserify for something it's not actually made for. I don't actually want to use any npm modules right now :) I just want the commonjs require in my browser code and the bundling of all the small js files including templates.
