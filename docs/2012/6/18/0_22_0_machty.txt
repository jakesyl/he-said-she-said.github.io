cool. thank you. aaaand finalmente, the reason apache is incompatible with node is that apache is blocking and each request hogs a thread until it runs to completion, yes? so event-based servers like node and anything else that supports long-polling (in a practical manner) can only be run on something like nginx and not apache, but that blocking servers (like rails) can still run on event-based nginx?
