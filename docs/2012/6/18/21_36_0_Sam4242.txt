Hi guys... Question about Node JS and sockets: Have any of you used serialization or compression for stuff leaving your server? I'm currently sending raw JSON, but I've been informed that's not such a good idea network performance wise. I'm interested in two options: protobufs, and gzip... an anything else that could be cross platform. Advantages or disadvantages of protobufs, vs gzip byte compression, etc?
