hello.  I was wondering if anyone can shine some light on a problem I am having... it's a really odd one:  I have node.js C++ module.    (building with cmake/make).  Works fine. a single .cpp file with headers.  The second I add another .cpp file (even just a generic #include <stdio.h> void test(void) { printf("test"); }     node reports that it no longer is able to load the module.  require()
