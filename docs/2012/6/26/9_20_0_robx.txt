I have question regarding Mongo (tried the mongo channel with no luck) I have a document structure where each document has a sub document like: { field : value, subdocument : { field : value } }. I need to do a query where one of the fields in the subdocument is unique. Any suggestions? Or is the only way to do a distinct first, save those results in memory then do findOne foreach of those results?? Help really appreciated and might result in a cookie!
