Thanks for the opinions, but... well.. I think I'll go and call it a day. I've been all day at this and I've done almost nothing. Clearly I can't let go of everything that experience taught me and just "fiddle about", so I'll go ahead and re-think my possible strategies and, unfortunately, whether or not to adopt node instead of re-using .net or php again.
