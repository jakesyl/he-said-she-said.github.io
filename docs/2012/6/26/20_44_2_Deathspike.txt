othiym23: This is the real major issue, I seem to be getting told that I should just worry about functionality first and care about architecture later, however with almost 8 years of both PHP and C# experience that is both counter-intuitive and I wouldn't even begin to trust myself or a team just to let them do whatever they want. There's no real guidelines, I'm missing this a LOT.
