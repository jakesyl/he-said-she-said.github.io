tjholowaychuk: Sorry to disturb, but just a quick question. I used node 0.6.9, just upgraded to node v0.8.0release (from GIT) and get Cannot read property 'url' of undefined on /home/sven/projects/pladeo/node_modules/connect/lib/proto.js:104:18...  I just removed ALL app code, basically, there is app=new expresblablah, then app.listen, and I still have the problem... Is there anything new and obligated for connect since... say the last 4 months?
