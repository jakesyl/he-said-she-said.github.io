Hi, I recently upgraded node.js to v0.8.0 from v0.6.19 and I've started getting a random error from the 'http' module. When someone connects to the server its running, I get this error "Error: TypeError: Object [IP:PORT] has no method 'enter'", looking around events.js I found the issue is on line 80 "this.domain.enter();" when the 'Domain' module does not have an 'enter' method. Anyone have any ideas on what would cause this?
