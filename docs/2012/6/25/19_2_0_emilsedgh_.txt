im writing a music streaming webapp. it is supposed to let users play 20% of all tracks, unless they buy the track. im using node for streaming the actual mp3, but not using static middleware, so i can parse content-range headers and make sure user gets the 20% of file. my only question is... does it scale? i mean, i've heard a lot about that i should use an nginx or something for erving static files.
