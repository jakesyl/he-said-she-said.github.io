I'll try again, since this is an odd problem with a likely simple solution. I have a codebase that is tested and working on several other Linux systems. I `git clone`d it to a new Linux system. No code has been changed. On the new system, require() is failing with relative paths, which begin with "./" and "../". The target files all exist. Anyone have any idea what might be going on?
