deoxxa: AAAAAH - I got it. When receiving a full url(from a user ex) you get: "http://i.should/not/../read/the/docs", then I would var foo = url.parse(url); var result = url.resolve(foo.protocol+"//"+foo.hostname, foo.path), unfortunately the url module parses the path, but it contains a / as first character and is therefore not resolved correctly :(
