Hello, anyone versed in the Express framework here ? Actually I come from Python/jQuery  and I'm still kinda young with Node.js. My problem: I'd like to "extend" the Express "Request/Response" objects by adding new methods - for instance, as there is res.json(), I could want to implement res.xml(). What's the recommended way to do it, other then obviously editing the source files ?
