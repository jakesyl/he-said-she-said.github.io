mscdex: Honestly my problem is actually fairly simple. I have a good grasp on the theory of why it works and what it does. ...I'm having issues with syntax. When I write javascript code I understand function(variable) to pass "variable" (defined elsewhere) to the "function." Something like this:   fs.readdir(".", function (err, filenames) { ...filenames is not defined elsewhere and I don't understand how it's getting its value.
