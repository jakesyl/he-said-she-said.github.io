I guess I'll just leave this here: I can build my module successfully, but when I try to run the javascript test file and require it I get an undefined symbol error from the .node file and it's a symbol which was defined in a library which is supposed to be statically linked. Since there were no errors while linking, I don't understand why the symbol is undefined.
