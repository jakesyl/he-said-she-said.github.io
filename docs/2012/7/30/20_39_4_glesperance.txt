hey guys. I'm currently trying to deploy my nodejs app via puppet and my puppet script fails at installign the npm deps of the app. I am sure npm is properly invoked since it is able to  spit out a npm-debug.log ; the weird thing is that if I log onto the machien and exec npm install myself, everything isntalls properly...
