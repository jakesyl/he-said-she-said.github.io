Hey yall.  I first read that one should *not* gitignore npm modules but instead rebuild in the production environment.  Now I'm reading about shrinkwrap.  Does shrinkwrap mean I should be ignoring the module files?  And building in production from shrinkwrap?  Just trying to get some 7/2012 advice, thanks.
