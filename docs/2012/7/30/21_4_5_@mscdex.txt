Brightstar: it goes like this: 1. fs.readdir('somedir', foo); 2. node goes out to the file system and puts in a request to read the contents of 'somedir' and returns immediately. 3. some time later the file system responds and node gets this response. 4. node executes your callback function, passing information to it provided by the file system
