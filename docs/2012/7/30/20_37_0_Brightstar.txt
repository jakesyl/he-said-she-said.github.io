mscdex: Thank you. I HAVE read all of those except nodeguide fairly exhaustively. ...As I said I just don't have the experience to make all the pieces fall in place. Plus i learn best by doing. I'm nearly at the point where I can start doing something and see what it does (to help me process) ...Just trying to connect the last few dots. ...I'll see what I can find in nodeguide.
