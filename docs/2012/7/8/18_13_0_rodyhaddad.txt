Hello awesome people, I'm trying to write a small script in node.js, but I encountered a problem. I need to post some data to some php on the same server, but it doesn't seem to work. I'm using http.request (should I be using it for that?). The node.js script and the php is running on the same server. If I make the post to another server, it works, but if it is the same server, it doesn't. What should I be doing to make a request
