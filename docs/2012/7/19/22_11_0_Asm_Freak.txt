I want some insight with a problem that I'm having with my native Node.js add-on that doesn't work in v0.8 but works in v0.6. Is there a specific place I should post my question/problem? The dev mailing list looks more focused towards internal Node dev topics and the other mailing list looks like user land stuff. Thoughts?
