i have a co-existing node.js/php setup on my server. php handles webmail stuff while node.js handles chat. When a webmail is sent via php from user 1 to user 2 i need to notify user2 that a mail has been sent. my node.js has a websocket connection to the client. Can i somehow from PHP manipulate the node.js process so that it sends the notification to the client?
