I have a function to get the PID listening on certain port: function x(port, cb) { exec('lsof -i tcp:' + port + ' -t', function(err,stdout,stderr) { ... }. As you can see, the port is passed to the function (originally a Number() and then converted toString()). Anyway, child_process.exec does not work, it throws a 'Command failed:' (with no explanation) but if I declare 'port' inside the function itself it works... any ideas???
