Zoney: most of the candidates i've ever interviewed for PHP/JS positions couldn't even solve fizbuz questions. Example: write a function that gets an integer value and returns the number of digits in it. Solution: ceil(log(num)) or a recursive one, or a loop or anything. those guys couldn't figure it out.
