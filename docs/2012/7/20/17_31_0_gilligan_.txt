Owner, i think this does not really relate to my problem though.. the project setup in itself is just fine and i can run the jasmine tests through maven using the jasmine maven pugin just fine - in that plugin i can specify the libs that need to be included. I would like to be able to run the tests without maven using jasmine-node though.. but that doesn't work because it doesn't load/include backbone, underscore, the other stuff i use ..
