hatch: if you have a dev/prod environment and you code in dev, push to prod.  when you push from dev to prod you're going to have to go to prod to change the connection, and you'll have to do that everytime you push to prod.  if you put it in a config file then you just manually create the config files and once it works you don't ever have to worry about changing your script after you push to prod
