hey everybody im looking for a databse solution for a shop-system with a social character build up on nodejs. rdbms might be to slow, with document oriented nosql i might have to store redunant data. so i had a look at various graph databases (neo4j, orientdb, arangodb). i would like to store pure json values like in couchdb. because its a shop-system ACID and rollback functionality would be great. Does Anyone have some experiences in this field
