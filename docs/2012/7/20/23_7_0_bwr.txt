I'm new to nodejs and I'm trying to get started with flatiron. I'm using the http plugin and I read that it requires union. I've installed union both in the local directory and globally using -g but when I start my application it still says 'flatiron.plugins.http requires the `union` module from npm'. Any ideas? It is probably something stupid I'm doing but I have no idea
