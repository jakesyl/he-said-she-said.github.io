Wanted to make it a bit dynamic so instead of fetching data from zabbix directly on the client (there is a jquery plugin) I figured it would be nicer to fetch it once every minute serverside and push out the updates to connected clients with sockets.io or something similar :) That way I can have nodes dynamically appearing/disappearing using d3.js :D
