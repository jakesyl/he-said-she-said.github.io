Ok, I think I've got enough to play with.  If you'd like to see what it is I'm building, I've got a playable prototype of the game using more traditional PHP and AJAX polling up at http://www.yousaidwhatgame.com .  I'm hoping to have the node.js+socket.io powered version up in the next couple of days.
