I've been programming for many years, ~6-8 years. Started with PHP, then JS (front-end). I've only recently started work with the node framework (february), but I have picked it up pretty rapidly and have been builting the project sense then. I suffer from the dunning-krugger effect, greatly, so I don't know how I compare with other programmers, because I've mainly kept to solo dev, never team work.
