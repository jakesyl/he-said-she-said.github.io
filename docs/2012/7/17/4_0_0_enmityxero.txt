Unless you're really serious, I'd recommend not putting too much money into the project (ie, don't hire people, pay for relocation, lease an office space, etc) when remote is fine. I'd keep relationships strictly professional, as well. It depends on the developers and their experience how much it'll cost. I'd assume there are still freelance listings where you could research hourly wages for node developers
