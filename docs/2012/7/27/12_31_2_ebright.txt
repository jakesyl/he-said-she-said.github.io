timoxley in this simple case I would too, but it's a simplied version of a different scenario (retrieve data from couchDB, edit doc (change _id to be precise), insert new doc and then delete old doc - to do this last step I would need to pass the _id from the first get to the delete call - which is nested in the insert callback)
