v8 related question: to concatenate a group of strings passed from JS land to C++ land (e.g. for interpolating strings) would it be more performance to use repeated calls to v8::String::Concat(left, right) and building up a ConsString object, or would it be better to count byte lengths for all the strings then allocate once and copy the contents of each string into the new buffer?
