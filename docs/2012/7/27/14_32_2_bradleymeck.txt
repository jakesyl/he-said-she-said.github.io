separation of data aggregation and final rendering after is generally how node apps work, most adhoc sites done quick and dirty mix data aggregation and view rendering together. they are entirely different in my book, even if async operations occur, you will want to do that model in almost any language where you are not blocking the render pipeline or streaming the render pipeline somehow
