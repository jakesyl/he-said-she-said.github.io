Hi all. Using socket.io. I emit 'replay' from the client, and ask the server to push series of batches to 'replay' on the client. Client does processing on each batch (so there builds up a queue). Id like to have a callback that I gave in the initial emit to server fire when the client is done with the last batch. Is this the best conceptual approach?
