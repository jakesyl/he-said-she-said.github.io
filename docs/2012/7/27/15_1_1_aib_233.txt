on node 0.6.9 I have a working setup with a spawn process, and a "data" event listener filling a buffer with data events ( output of the spawn binary is a png ), â€¦ on 0.8.4 I'm having some difficulties to configure everything correctly. I'm not 100% sure but the encoding of stout seems to be wrong by default to handle binary data.
