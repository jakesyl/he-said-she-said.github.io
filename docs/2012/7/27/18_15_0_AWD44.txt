Hello i'm a little new to node.js and wondering how to check a webpage's files for a keyword including the .css .js files associated to it.  How would something like this be done in node.js?  Currently I am doing something similar in PHP in which i crawl the site and download to a folder on the localmachine and then use the grep command to search within the files
