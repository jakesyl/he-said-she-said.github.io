I have to go to bed so I don't screw it upâ€¦ I guess. But, this one time, someone uninvited me from their birthday party because of my beliefs. So i bought them a giftcard to somewhere they didn't like and mailed it to them. Now if they don't use it, they donated to a cause they're against. I'm not sure if that makes me an asshole, or the giver of the best gag gift ever ;-)
