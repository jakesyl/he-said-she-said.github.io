anyone got an example of doing the following?  I want to use models.users.getByID(...); so obviously I need to var models = require('./models') and in my ./models.js file exports.users = require(./models/users');  but here's the kicker, I want to send redis from my app.js along with it. How do wrap modules.exports = function(redis) {}; in ./models/index ? sorry for the long winded question
