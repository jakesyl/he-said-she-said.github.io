asyncronous is when no part of the code is holding up another part, anytime i/o happens, instead of waiting for the request to complete, node goes onto doing the next thing, when the i/o returns, the callback is used, so the control flow isn't like a recipe, it's a free for all of things running as soon as they can without holding anything else up in the process
