I deleted my facebook I was so sick of hearing people say Chick-fil-a's president doesn't have the right to be christian in america. He has as much of a right to be christian as people to be gay. The media has blown this out of proportion. If people want to support gay marriage go after the people who make laws, not DELICIOUS chicken :-)
