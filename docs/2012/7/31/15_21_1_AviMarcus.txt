OK I don't get this. I have a mocha test (using should) that requires a file that connects to redis. All works fine. But when I start mocha at -w to watch, it restarts.. but never reconnects to redis. I did notice without an explicit disconnect, the watcher doesn't ever auto-cleanup the test code's running processes.
