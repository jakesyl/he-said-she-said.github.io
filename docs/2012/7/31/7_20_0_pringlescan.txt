Asynchronous code doesn't wait for anything. If you try to right synchronous code in a do this, do that, fashion it will just fall through. Anything that requires time, usually i/o, will be queued so the main execution flow can continue without being held up. So by not looping and waiting for input/output, asynchronous code can handle more requests and handles concurrency in a different way than other paradigms.
