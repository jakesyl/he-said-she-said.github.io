Howdy, I'm having a weird issue with http.get on version .84â€¦ I have code to retrieve a URL and it works when I test it independently, however, when I test it in an app that loops through a CSV file and queries MySQL it doesn't get any responses, however, the rest of the application continues to loop through the results as expected. Could the reading the CSV file be blocking http I/O somehow?
