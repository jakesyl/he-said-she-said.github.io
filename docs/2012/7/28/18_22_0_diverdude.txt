I am doing require('mysql'), to get the node-mysql module loaded. I then in the beginning of my node.js file call mysqlclient = mysql.createClient() to connect. In my socket.io connect event i then do mysqlclient = mysql.query() which for some reason is completely ignored. If i do console.log(mysqlclient) in the connect event it seems that the connection is very much allive...so why is the query being ignored?
