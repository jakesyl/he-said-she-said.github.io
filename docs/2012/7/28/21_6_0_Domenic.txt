mikeal: I see. I mean, I guess that speaks to the point of the original post about how OAuth2 is way too extensible. But from my perspective if you're doing an extension then you shouldn't expect interoperability. I guess the spec is in this wierd in-between state where it gives you the option to hang yourself alone but not enough constraints and interoperability to hang together.
