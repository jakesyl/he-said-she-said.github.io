So. I'm looking to store 10million+ pieces of info in memory. It's key(int) -> value(int) + date created (int?). Storing as key[12345]={val: 23456, date:7890} this seems to take up >1gb for 10 million records. Since the actual data is only ~220mb ( 8 bytes per number) is there a data type that will take up less space? I'm open to using memcache or redis, but I think memcache  has a 120byte overhead which brings us back to the same plac
