hmmm if i put mysqlclient = mysql.createClient({}) in the top of my file and later in a socket.io connection handler do mysqlclient.query() it does not work, however if i do the mysqlclient = mysql.createClient({}) down in the connection handler just above my query it works fine. Why cant it use the global connection object when it can use the local?
