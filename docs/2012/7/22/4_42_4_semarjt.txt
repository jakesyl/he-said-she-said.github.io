i have a webservice set up that wraps a connection to a tcp socket. it waits for a response from the socket before responding, what i find is if i cause the tcp connection to wait several seconds before responding, i can keep sending http requests..up until about 3/4, if i have that many pending http requests, the server will no longer respond
