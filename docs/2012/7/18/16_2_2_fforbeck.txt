hi, I'm using node-soap-client api (https://github.com/minchenkov/node-soap-client), and when I call some operation from my client, it doesn't find the action. And I've got this error: throw 'Cant resolve type "' + typeInfo.name + '" in namespace ' + typeInfo \n     Cant resolve type "doAuthRequest" in namespace ... But I know the action is avaliable.. anybody can help
