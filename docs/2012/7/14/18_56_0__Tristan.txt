I have a complicated-ish question. I'm using net to connect to a chat server which ends all of it's packets with \0. When data is received, I first check if that chunk is equal to "ping\0" which I need to respond to. However, is it possible that two packets would arrive in that one chunk, causing me to miss that ping? Or is it possible that only half of the packet would arrive in that chunk, the other half arriving in the next?
