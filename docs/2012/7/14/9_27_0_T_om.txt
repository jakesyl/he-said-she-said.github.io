according to the docs, npm install <package> should install in the current working directory, however it installs them in /var/www/node_modules, which I assume is because the first time I ever installed one, I was in that directory on the command line? so now that must be my default, although I have no idea how to change it,  and appendly npm takes a <where> argument to install packages...
