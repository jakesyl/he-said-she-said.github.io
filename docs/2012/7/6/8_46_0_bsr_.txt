I'm trying to spawn a mysqldump, and it works great when dumping localhost.  When I want to use node to open a ssh tunnel to dump a remote host the spawned mysqldump complains that the user I'm using to dump with can't connect via localhost; if I console.log the command and its arguments to see what it's theoretically attempting, I can copy and paste that into a shell and it works great.. any ideas?
