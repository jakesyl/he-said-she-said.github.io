hey, I have a replicated npm registry, with no authentication (don't want any since I need ldap authentication and couchdb doesn't have that). I'm doing authentication by putting a proxy in front of it that can do ldap auth, then it lets the requests through. However, when I try to publish something to my registry I get this message from the _design/app/validate_doc_update key/function: "Please log in before writing to the db". I think I can just edit that and
