@isaacs I've been using a simple postInstall script to install tarballed dependencies for my projects (ala "postinstall": "npm cache clean; npm install ./local_module-0.0.1.tgz"), but that no longer seems to work with the newest version of npm. I now get the error "npm WARN skipping, cannot run in /path/to/my/app@0.0.6 npm cache clean; npm install ./local_module-0.0.1.tgz. Is there another way I can specify a *local* tarball to install?
