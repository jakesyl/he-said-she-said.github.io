So I'm trying to accomplish a easy task over here.. I want to push some data, I have it like this: registerform in python and then I'm counting all the users in the database and displaying it on my home page, when a user creates a new account that value increases but the user ahve to refresh that page to see the count of the users. I dont want that. I want to push that count. Anyone have a idea?
