look, what I am developing is a game that consist of 5 rounds of questions. So I need a timer that goes off at the end of each round. The problem is that I am going to scale this game so many players can play this. Lets say Player1 creates a game and player2 joins it. Now the timer needs to be created. I cant pre-define 10 000 timer var's in server.js for the 10 000 games that might occur...
