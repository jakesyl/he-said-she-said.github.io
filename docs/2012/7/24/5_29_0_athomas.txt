noob question, can i bundle node.js to an asset like a pdf that would typically doesn't have the capability of communicating and make it "communicatable" for eg. the user only viewed 3 out of 4 pages in this pdf. i would think i would have to find a way to program this pdf but wondering if it is possible. thanks in advance.
