so i am using express redirect. "/go". the problem is since the node server is on port 777, and and i use nginx as a reverse proxy, it redirect it domain.com:777 instead of the regular redirect. Setting basepath to "http://domain.com" resolves in domain.com:777/domain.com/go. Anything else besies using absolute redirects in each redirect?
