Anyone have any thoughts or some history on where I can get a mac PPC compatible version of node. I have tried most the builds but the compiler does not offer a ppc CPU option, and all the universal binaries that I have tried are all compiled for intel since I get the error "Bad CPU type" on launch of node.
