@Iszak, Node is still pre-1.0. It's on the verge of 1.0, but not yet there. It's been stabilizing at a very good pace, with the code team focusing on particular issues with each major release. You can see the version release notes to learn what each of these things are. The software will never be perfect. Instead the team is prioritizing features to complete in order to call Node officially 1.0.0.
