I am using socketIO for some project. Now I have a confirmation variable, whose computation is done server side and I get the value of the variable using socketIO callbacks. but since its async, the confirmation logic is evaluated before the callback returns and fails everytime. Is there a better way of doing this? or a way around this problem?
