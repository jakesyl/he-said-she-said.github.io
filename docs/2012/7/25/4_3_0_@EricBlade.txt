styol hmm.. i figured that would be the case unless there was something really weird going on, but figured i'd better check -- i'm getting a log from the first step of a process happening sometime after the 3rd or 4th step completes, and i don't see how it's possible that the intermediate steps can occur without step 1 happening o.O
