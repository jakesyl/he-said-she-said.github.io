so anyways isaacs i came up with a pretty cool pattern for handling bash auto-completion in grunt. grunt --completion=bash will simply output the contents of the internal grunt /completions/bash script to the console. so all you have to do to enable bash auto-completion is add: eval "$(grunt --completion=bash)" to your ~/.bashrc - and this will support an eventual zsh version as well
