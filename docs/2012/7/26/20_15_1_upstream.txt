Quick question, i'm interested in building a job queue from scratch with Node that simply checks Mongo for a document and processes it. However I'd like this node process to just keep checking Mongo for documents to process in a loop... should I make my node script and use something like `cron` or should I write the Node script inside a setInterval() ?
