I'm using socket.io and my app works wonderfully well with Chrome (websockets) and IE9 (jsonp long polling) but Firefox keeps throwing this annoying error..."[16:52:09.484] uncaught exception: [Exception... "Security error"  code: "1000" nsresult: "0x805303e8 (NS_ERROR_DOM_SECURITY_ERR)"  location: "https://redacted.com/notifications/socket.io/socket.io.js Line: 2322"]
