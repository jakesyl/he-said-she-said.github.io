I'm hoping somebody can clear up some confusion with the event queue for me.  If there is a queue, I've read that you cannot guarantee the execution order of the queued callbacks.  The app I'm working on needs to know the phone state of a person.. so theoretically, I might report that a person got a new call, before I reported they completed a call (simple race condition).  Any tips on how to correctly handle this?
