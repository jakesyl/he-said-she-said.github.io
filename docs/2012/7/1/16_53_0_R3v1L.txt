I'm trying to figure how to develop an app with node.js and I can't understand a thing: There is a main thread that is executing all node.js application, but IO is made under other threads to not blocking main app. So, If I access the server and request a dabase register and another person access nearly same time as me (but later), updating that register, is there a posibility that I get the updated register?
