I need a VERY simple XHR fileupload javascript library.. Basically I need to have a class with a method that, once called, shows the file requester in the browser, user selects the file, then I need events... "submit" event fires when the upload starts, "cancel" event fires either if the user canceled the file requester, OR if a "cancel" method has been called.. A "progress" like event for giving me a % of total uploaded.. And a "finish" for when
