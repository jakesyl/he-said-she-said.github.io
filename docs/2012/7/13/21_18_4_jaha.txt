If im looking to distribute multiple JS based apps(modules) through a node locally served "mother" app, how does using npm sound to manage the download and installation of these client-side apps? Any other suggestions? Im thinking it would work like this: msg sent to mother app to load app1, mother checks to see if it has it, it doesnt, so it downloads the package via npm(git) and once ready, loads the app
