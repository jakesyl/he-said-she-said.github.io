I am looking for an upload class (for browsers) that can do XHR uploads, that only has methods to open the file requester, and cancel uploads, that has events for start, end, cancel, and progress of the file upload and that has some extra methods / events for drag-drop file upload.. NO HTML interface whatsoever, I can do that myself around it very simple.. Anybody who could recommend me something?
