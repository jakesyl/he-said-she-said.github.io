isaacs: what are your thoughts on the wording of node's api? that is, it takes a unix-like wording/style rather than a web / browser style? well what i mean is process vs worker api. shouldn't node try to follow the browser api ? that way less and less modification need to be made for js code to run via browser/node ?
