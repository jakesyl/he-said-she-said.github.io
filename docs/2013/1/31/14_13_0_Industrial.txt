Say I have a View and a Model, on `view.setModel(model);`, I would like to bind to events for changed attributes on the model. Should I just do one 'change' event on the model and then each time find out if there were properties changed that I should change in the view, or should I make the event name incorporate the changed attribute, and set up a listener in the view for each attribute?
