i have a bit of a newbie question with nodejs. we currently have a RoR backend API and a BackboneJS front end. can nodeJS replace both of these? i'm looking to be able to pull the client away from the server so we can compile it onto phonegap for mobile phone usage. is there an MV* framework where I can develop in one code base but then break away client if required?
