I've been at this ALL day if anyone can point me in the right direction, I'm making a url post request to my nodeJS server from a .NET app.  about 1 out of 10 times, the request will idle, eventually the .NET request will timeout saying the request was cancelled.  However if while it's idling, I stop and start the nodeJS server, the idling request will complete
