yeah in my case i'm using couchdb, which returns query/view results which can be keyed by either single values or arrays, and so i thought i'd create a client-side cache of results, i.e. cached[row.key] = row.value -- and in some cases row.key is an array... so in terms of what you've said, that's fine, because that row.key array gets "stringified" anyway
