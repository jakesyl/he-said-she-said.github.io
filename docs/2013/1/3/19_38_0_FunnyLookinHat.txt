I've built and implemented a basic game engine that handles position / speed / direction / etc. - but I want to be able to customize the rules of the world that it's running with an API of sorts.  i.e. create custom events, fire them off, implement the API for when users collide, etc. etc. - anyone know how I should be approaching that?
