medikoo: I am curious how to build a flow of async functions like A->B->C where B depends on A keeping it's promise and C depends on B, but with a quirk, I want a branch from A, if A fails to go to B` so that B` actually depends on A breaking its promise, and if B` keeps its promise then the flow should go back to B, otherwise throw an error
