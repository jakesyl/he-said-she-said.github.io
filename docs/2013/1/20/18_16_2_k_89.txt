well, trying to make a simple blog-like-thingy in nodejs and getting a problem in using sequelize , This is my user model: http://paste.laravel.com/gey ... and this is my article model: http://paste.laravel.com/gez , the console.log(article) i have in the user Model definition shows its an empty object. I think the problem is with each definition requiring the other to be present. How do I tackle this
