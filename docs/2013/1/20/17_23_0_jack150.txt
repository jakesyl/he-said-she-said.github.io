at the start of my script i create a filehandle for a stream: var f = fs.createWriteStream('log.txt', {'flags': 'a'}); and whenever i want to write something (at various points) i simply use f.write(string) // i never close it and i've only tested it for 1 user and it works but I wondered if it's bad on my resources/memory or if I'm likely to run into problems
