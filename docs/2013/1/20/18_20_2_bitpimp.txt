I'm working on a classic todo app backbone.js example.  The examples make get, put, delete etc REST calls which reference the todo's with simple ID numbers, such as 'todos/1' or 'todos/2'.  I set it up with a node db.  Node stores with the _id values... what is a typical way to work between the two versions of the todo items?
