I didn't implement it yet... We have this proxy working for HTTP. After a long searching, couldn't find a way to do instead of Man-in-the-middle, which doesn't sound llike a solution. So, I'm trying to implement it as a TCP proxy... I got the packets using net.createServer, but, the Buffer is encrypted ¬¬... I'm trying to find somehow to fix it... Any idea?!
