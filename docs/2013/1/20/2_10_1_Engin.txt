as I'm using node on Windows/Cygwin it proves to be problematic in many steps. Once and for all I want to fix this. Is it possibleto have a perfectly working node installation by just preparing a node folder and appending it to the PATH. i.e. can npm figure out what ist he prefix and install global packages accordingly ? so that I'd have nodeunit in the path automatically ?
