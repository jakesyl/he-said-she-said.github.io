websockets 101 (and yes I know socket.io is available): I finally got my websocket hello world working, ( http://pastebin.com/Pk6ZchXv ) but this method wraps an http server in a websocket, and appears to have two request handlers. Is there a way to remove http and dependencies, while simplifying handlers?
