Has anyone worked with promises? I don't get it yet :-\. tutorials explain it like 'well if you have a promise then you can .then(another thing) and it works magically' but the thing is; I don't have any promise yet. Where do I start out? I have an algorithm or rather a series of steps I want to do, but I don't see how to implement it using promises (for example, with Q)
