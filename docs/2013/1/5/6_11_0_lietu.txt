I made a simple static file web server + gzip compression + 404 handler with node + connect .. worked perfectly through my development (on mageia linux), but when I installed a new server (ubuntu server 12.04) and set up a new node environment (same version), it started to serve blank responses ~40% of the time .. got any simple ideas, or would it be easier for me to just reinstall the server with something else than ubuntu and see if that changes ...
