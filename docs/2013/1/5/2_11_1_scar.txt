For my purpose, I am sending a URL to the Node.js (somehow, very new to Node.js), and will have it grab the sourcecode of that url, and process "tests" on it. is Node.js good for me? If i write the JS app client-side, they have access to my code. With Node.js, they cannot access, but just get a return value 0-100% ?
