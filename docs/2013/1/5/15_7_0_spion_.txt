hmm, fibers aren't so bad, performance-wise. for a (obviously CPU-intensive) primes calculator i managed to make "thread-like" fibers with explicit "preemption points" that does "context switching" once every 5 milliseconds (allowing other operations on the event loop to execute) and the execution time jumped from 6.5s only to 9.15s
