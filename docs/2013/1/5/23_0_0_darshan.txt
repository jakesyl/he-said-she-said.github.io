hi. I need help with using facebook and node. I am not very profecient at node. But here is what I intend to do: The user hits the app page, authorizes the app to access its details. *Must log in to enable in the process. The app gets the access token and figures the rest. I am unable to get a clear direction to help me achieve this, using the modules suggested by facebook.
