I could not find this anywhere else.... supose I call fs.writeFile(path,data1); and in the live after I call fs.writeFile(path,data2); I understand the async nature of Node, but in the end of the day if this is only one process one of the operations will be executed before the other... the question is if Node will see that it is about the same file and the last call will be the content in the file afterwards...
