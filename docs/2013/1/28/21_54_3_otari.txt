hello, i am developing news website, which now is up and running, its just new one and it has about 300 users online everytime.. i tried to implement node.js to it.. but i still have no success.. the problem is that when i enable my nodejs app it starts working just perfect but after some time.. (maximum was 1 day) nodejs app stops and it needs to be restarted.. and sometimes it takes to load /path/to/socke.io.js file to long from client side..can anyone hel
