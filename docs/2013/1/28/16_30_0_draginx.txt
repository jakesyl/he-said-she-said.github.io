superjoe: hey :) So I'm planning on using systemd for deploying my nodejs application and everytime i use git deploy, I want to checkout to  adirectory and run 'naught deploy' (to update obviously) now the problem is.. I need a way to do somehting like naught start app.js --force or something like that to override despite the fact that there's a naught.ipc file
