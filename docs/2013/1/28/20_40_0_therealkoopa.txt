I was finding that starting phantom and opening my page to grab an image was taking too long, so I hacked something together: I start a phantom server that receives requests. When it starts, it loads the page once...Then each request changes the page, and then it captures the image. This way I don't have to fire off phantom ecah time, and reload the page each time, rendering the javascript.
