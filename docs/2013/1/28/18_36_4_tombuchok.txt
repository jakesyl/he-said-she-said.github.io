should we expect a module to be faster than a child process? we are about embark on building a module with some c code as we're finding `exec`ing our binary with a child process is running much slower -- we're doing some SSL decryption, happy to explain further -- but doing all the work without knowing how much more performance we'll get seems a bit dicey. thoughts?
