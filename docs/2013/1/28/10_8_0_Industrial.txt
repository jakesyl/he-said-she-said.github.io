scuse my generated output, but I think it's quite readable; https://gist.github.com/8b07a41e6deb434630db/93803962f03fa4c2d659749c1a9b079368418718 if I call render and then inject and then render again, the DOM is unchanged after the second render. Does this mean every time I want to update a DOM node, I should remove it, update it and add it in place again?
