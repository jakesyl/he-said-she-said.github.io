so, I'm trying to create an object "DSCrawler" that is a prototype that I want to reuse a number of times, and in another file I am creating WSCCrawler, which is based on DSCrawler... but if I require() the file that DSCrawler is in, it actually creates an instance of the object (which is a waste)... any way around that?
