Hi, I have a question about installing an NPM module. I'm fairly new to this stack, and #mongodb weren't able to help me. I'm on OS X 10.8 and have installed Node and MongoDB fine. However, when I get to install the driver using npm (npm install mongodb) I get "child process exited with code 127 execvp(): No such file or directory"
