i have a simple tcp server in node. when a connection joins, nodes ram usage goes up by 4K. however i have noticed that it sometimes goes up when closing a connection too. the ram usage never seems to return to what it started at. in my code, once the connection is closed there is nothing further running. is this standard behaviour? (i've admittedly only tried it with 20~ connections but i assumed memory usage would go back down?)
