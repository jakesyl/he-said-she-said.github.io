So to summarize: using express.js, my server works, everything works. But I need to parse a cookie inside socket.io, so in my socket.js route, I require express. Later I do express.utils.parseSignedCookie(myCookie,mySecret) and it fails saying, "TypeError: Cannot call method 'parseSignedCookie' of undefined". Main app.js:  http://pastebin.com/1X86Vawd and routes/socket.js http://pastebin.com/Buy70mjg ... thoughts? I'm very new
