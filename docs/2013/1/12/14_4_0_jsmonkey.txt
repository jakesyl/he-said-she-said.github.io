I am going to rebuild a web scraper I made in Ruby to Javascript using Node. I am thinking express framework for a nice rest api interface to the app along with a small graphical UI with socket.io to tell when the scraper is done etc. Is phantomjs best for scraping or what other is there? Can phantomjs post to auth and such on websites?
