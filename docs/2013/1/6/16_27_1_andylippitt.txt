sinclair|work one approach I've seen that makes that seem a little less offensive is when you blow REST out with unique IDs on every method that expects a change on the server, and both ends expect that every method is reentrant... then POSTing or PUTing the same action a second or third time with unique ID doesn't cause anything new to happen.  In my mind anyways, this somewhat salves the REST vs. Transaction conflight
