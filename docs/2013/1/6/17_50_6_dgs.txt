are npm installed modules specific to the directory/project you were in when you installed it? or are they system/user wide installs? e.g. if I install for example the express module, do I only need to download it once, or do I need to install again for each new project? (I'm going to be offline for a week or so and am going to be trying to have a play round with nodeâ€¦)
