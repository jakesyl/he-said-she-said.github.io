hi, i have the problem, that I have 'hanging' connections on my node serverâ€¦ I have written a download server in node, but it seems that it does not accept more than 8 connections per tcp connection? the behaviour is very weird. The download hangs with one browser, but if i start the additional download in another browser, one it works perfectly
