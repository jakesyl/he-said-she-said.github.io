I've got a question for you, that one of you can probably answer.  I've got some servers that will be reading configuration out of a database.  Sometimes that configuration will be updated, and those servers need to read that config again.  Rather than polling, I'm thinking of setting up an out-of-band pub/sub so the server that updates the DB will also send out a message saying that it's been updated.
