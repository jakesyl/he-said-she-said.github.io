hello, I'm trying to use zepto for ajax but I think I'm getting a little confused - I'm using Mocha to thrash up a test script to validate the functions in my clientLibrary (this is to be used client side by html5 app), but I'm unsure how to invoke zepto when in a mocha test script. Could anyone help me clear up my confusion?
