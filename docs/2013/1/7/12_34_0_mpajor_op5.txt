I am really keen into at starting with node.js; I have a project I want to code using node.js as the base for it along with php/no-sql, however, I am not very well-familiar with javascript and especially not node.js (with socket.io) -- is there anyone who would be willing to discuss a thing or two with me in PM? I'd highly appreciate it
