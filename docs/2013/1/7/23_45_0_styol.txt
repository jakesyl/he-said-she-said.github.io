I'm quite the confused by an error object being received back from a module that is a C / C++ Addon -- { [Error: No such key] code: 13 } -- doesn't seem to be a valid object, yet error.code is indeed 13 and you can even do if (error == 'Error: No such key'){ /* true */ } while if (error === 'Error: No such key'){ / * is false */ } -- Any ideas? Me just curious at this point
