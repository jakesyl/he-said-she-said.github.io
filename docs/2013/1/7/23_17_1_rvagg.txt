isaacs: speaking of pulling it out.. I'm currently implementing a "generic session manager" that's modelled largely off RedSess but I don't need Redis support at the moment, I'm planning on putting a LevelDB backend to it for a start; would you be interested to see a PR to back RedSess with it when it's done?
