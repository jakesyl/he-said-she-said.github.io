I am building a "real-time" application, with a chat and with multiple divs updating in real-time, eg. when a user joins a specific chat channel I want a div to update with "a user joined chat channel #test and #test now has 1012 users in it". In addition to this I want to be able to "push out" messages to my visitors depending on what channel they are subscribed to, BUT not limited to a specific channel. For example: javascript client side subscribe
