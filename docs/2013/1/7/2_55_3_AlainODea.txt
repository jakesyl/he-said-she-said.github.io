I'd like a proxy that allows a DMZ from which no TCP connections could be initiated. I have three hosts User, Proxy and App. I would like App to connect to Proxy. When User connects to Proxy over HTTP or HTTPS the requests should be semantically proxied on the existing connection App made to Proxy. Is there an easy way to do this?
