Realistically speaking, tough, if you get a huge list and want to check every request against it you're doing to downgrade performance quite a bit. This is why I recommended doing it on OS level instead, but since that is not possible I guess you should make the most of redis, hashsets and so forth. Of course, changing the readable definition of a ip back to a int makes it infinitly faster.
