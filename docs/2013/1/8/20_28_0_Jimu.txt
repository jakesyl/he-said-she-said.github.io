I wrote some simple python CherryPy server to handle XHR requests from my browser-based app. It works fine. Then I discovered the node-webkit project, and I'm wondering if it's worth it, performance-wise, to move off the CherryPy backend to a full node-webkit app instead. No idea what kind of delays or overhead is involved in making XHR requests to a localhost server. Any thoughts?
