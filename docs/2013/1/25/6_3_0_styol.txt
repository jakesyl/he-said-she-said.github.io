So, yesterday I raised a relatively interesting question / design pattern related to EventEmitters and the ability to essentially pass an argument/object/etc around to event listeners, allowing each to modify the argument before returning it to the emitter itself. There is probably a great reason why this doesn't already exist and why the idea / implementation is terrible, but I'd love some feedback if anyone has any:
