azylman: i guess the best way to describe the reasoning would be to describe the source.. in drupal there are any number of modules that can "hook" into various tasks, much like emitters, the main difference being that they can make modifications and do xyz in various scenarios. It provides a very ambiguous, yet relatively structured way, to make alterations without hacking core or other contributed modules
