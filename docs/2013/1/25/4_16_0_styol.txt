samholmes: one way that is pretty crappy, but free/cheap is via email as a lot of carriers have number@carrier.net type end points. The down side of that approach is there are probably a lot of carriers that do not, and you would need to know the carrier of each end-user. Otherwise, there are some services such as tropo, twilio, and otherwise that offer cheapish universal solutions that appear to also have node modules
