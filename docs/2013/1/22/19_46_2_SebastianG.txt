Having Node.js Domains now, I wonder about the future of Node's default callback style, where the first argument represents a possible error. As far as I can see Node modules which are API-locked (Modules, Timers, util, Assert) don't use this kind of callback. Other module APIs which use error-callbacks, like FileSystem, are only called "stable". Do you think that indicates plans to make some changes in the future?
