im passing data between my clients and my node code using json. it all works perfectly however obviously i wish to handle what would happen if somebody tried sending incorrect json etc. i try to access various parts of each json request. so data.request, data.message etc. if one of these is missing, it'll generate an error. how are you handling this?
