So, another question. This one's getting more odd. So, when a form is invalid, I'm running my callback function which passes a 301 error with a "text/plain" type and a location header to redirect to. My callback function acknowledges all this, and console.log() is telling me 301 /login, but the browser is getting a... 200 OK /login?
