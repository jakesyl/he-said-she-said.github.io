Hi. I'm coding something which is similar to a blog structure: A post can be related to a category. I want to use mongodb as my database. Saving/retrieving of the articles is now problem, but I wonder how I should save the categories. usually I would just do sth. like {title: foobar, category: barfoo, id: â€¦.}. So when I want to show a list of categories now, what do I do?
