i want to inform visitors of my site when someone enters the chat-room (socket.io), my problem that the users of the main-page (a message board) refresh/change the page quite frequently and on every reload/refresh a new socket connection is made and the old one is disconnected. is there a better way to just broadcast info like this? (I unfortunately can't change the main page into a permanent 1-page-site)
