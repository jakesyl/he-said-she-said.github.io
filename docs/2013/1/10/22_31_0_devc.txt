I'm trying to get started on my first node.js mini-app and have been stumped on how to get node.io installed - npm's throwing an error blaming contextify but installing contextify alone works. I don't know if it's something I'm doing or a bug. I'm on OSX, have installed Xcode/Command Line, node.js + npm, is there anything I might be overlooking from a noob perspective, before pinning it to a node.io bug?
