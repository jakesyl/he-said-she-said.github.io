yanivge: prodding the room generally doesn't have the desired effect.  (Same as "bumping" mailing list threads, etc.)  It'd be best to share the actual code (with a link to gist.github.com or pastie.org or some such) and if no one responds, take it to a different channel (mailing list, github issues, etc.)
