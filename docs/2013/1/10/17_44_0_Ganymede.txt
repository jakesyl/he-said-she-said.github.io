Hello, never wrote any node.js code in my life but trying to determine if node.js is right for me. Planning to serve static files and dynamic pages AND JSON data via AJAX using nginx/PHP with PostgreSQL in the backend, and in memory-constrained servers (less than 4 GB RAM). Would it be appropriate to replace nginx/PHP with node.js (no webserver in front of node.js, clients talk directly to node.js)?
