Something I've read quite a bit is that node isn't good for putting up webpages that don't need the non-blocking nature of node. That people should use Python or Ruby with one of their frameworks. But I've used those frameworks and I think using node is just as easy to put a site up. A few things are handled automagically by Rails or Django, but I still don't see why that means its better to use them over node.
