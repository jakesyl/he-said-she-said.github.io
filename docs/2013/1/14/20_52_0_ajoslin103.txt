niggler - sorry but that doesn't matter.   we are rebuilding our flagship product, it's monolithic and unwieldy (pre-web 2.0 -- no ajax) and serves about a gigabit/sec 24x7 -- I want rebuild it as a collection of services that can can be used from a modern web front end that will be release as a suite of products.
