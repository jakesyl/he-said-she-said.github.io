Hello ! I got a problem: I made a html-site, with external css and Jquery scripts etc...now I wanted to show the user when he/she is browsing to localhost:8124 this html I allready tried "fs.readFile" and then sending the data to the client...works pretty fine, but the html seems to be saved anywhere else when read and send so it can't find and use the .css and .js files which are linked in...
