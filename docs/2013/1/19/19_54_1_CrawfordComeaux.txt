soooo....an app for the super bowl press room...who wants to work on it with me for the next 2 weeks (either remotely or possibly by flying you into new orleans & housing you w/a local dev)? the audition/interview: help me finish the prototype today. Work beyond prototype will be paid, but unsure how much cause the client is too busy to negotiate budget without a prototype.
