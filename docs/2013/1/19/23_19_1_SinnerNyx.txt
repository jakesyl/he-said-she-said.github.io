klaemo: ouch. :P. I thought I did. before I was doing var _cookies = require('cookies'); _cookies = new _cookies.Cookies(...), but I got it working now I think. I had to change _cookies.Cookies to Cookies. I'm still not sure why typeof _cookies would return undefined though. Shouldn't it be function?
