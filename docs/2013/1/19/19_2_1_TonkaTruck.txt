mistertwig: I guess my point is: if you want something that scales, you're not going to be using rdbms joins anywayâ€¦you're going to be joining at the app level.  Mongo still has performance benefits over mysql in this case, and you'll _still_ have the option to embed docs where appropriate/convenient.
