Engin: I think what you're saying is for the purpose of cached fields, like "username" etc.  Frankly, I would cache that with an rdbms, too.  People don't realize how expensive joins are.  Just make sure your app updates them when required, like when a user changes their username, etc.  It's tedious but will run so much faster with such less resources.
