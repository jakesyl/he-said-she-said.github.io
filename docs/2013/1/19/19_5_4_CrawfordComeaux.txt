Basically, take a pic & while you're modifying/tagging/commenting it, the app's already started uploading. They take a small hit on the backend when the have to scrap what's been received, but the outcome is typically that when you finally submit the rest of the metadata for the pic in the UI, you don't have to wait any further.
