hello. i'm new to node.js, so forgive me if i'm asking in the wrong place here. i'm working on an app using connect-assets, jade and stylus. having some performance issues. after profiling, it looks like my stylus files are being recompiled on every page request. wondering if this is normal, or if anyone has experience w/ connect-assets and stylus and might have some insight into this issue?
