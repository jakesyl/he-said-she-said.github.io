Hi guys.  I'm building a machine control server for a university computer lab.  I need to send status requests to an API exposed on each of my client machines, however there is no guarantee that these machines will be awake to receive said request.  I have found that if I construct my own socket, I can adjust the connection timeout, but with http.request(), it doesn't seem like I have that flexibility
