I'm working on a project for class. The scope is "JavaScript Networking", and I'm very impressed with Node.js's capabilities. The trick is, I've learned Node core uses some native code for OS interaction, I/O, and some callback instances. Because of this, I have to be very careful to know which parts are pure webSocket API's, and which parts 'cheat' by using native code.
