is anyone familiar with nodebeginner.org I almost finished the tutorial and now it seems to not be free anymore. It taught me the basic structure of a node app including the index file, the server, the request router and the request handler; is this structure somewha universala dn would serve as a good place to start? What resources may I look to next?  I'm willing to post the simple code if u want to see the structure I'm talking
