min|dvir|us:  bnoordhuis So i almost finished the node tut at nodebeginner.org and I understand the whole structure he gave to the example, an index.js file, a server, a request router and a request handler. Is this somewhat a universal structure? The tut does not seem to be free anymore and am wonder where to go next? I was recommended to do an express tutorial but I don't know if my fundamentals are good enough yet
