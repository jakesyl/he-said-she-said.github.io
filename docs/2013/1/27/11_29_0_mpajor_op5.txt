currently it's key + value being set to "updateuserwindow" on client-side, although, changing the data being set from io.sockets.emit('updateuserwindow', usernames); to usernames[socket.room] sounds to me like a logical solution to have it work as it did before, but apparently it doesn't want to parse the emitted data
