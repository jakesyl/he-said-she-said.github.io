boutell, in the experience I had with mongoose, I couldn't handle saving and other logic of sub-models in the sub-models, just the id and properties get saves in the containing model, so you must apply the logic there. Ex. I can't create a Profile model and have it be saved as part of a User model, and when a user get's saved, validate the profile with the profile model as part of the user model validation.
