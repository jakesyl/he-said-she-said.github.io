redshadowhero: with LGPL, you can attach the library to your program and you don't have to open source your program, but if you modify the library itself, you must open source those modifications. With MIT, you must keep the copyright notice in the code. That's it, that's all - you can modify and extend it to kingdom come and not release squat.
