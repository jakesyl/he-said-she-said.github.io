tpayne: if you are still here… node didn't break your phpmyadmin, LOL… but the right question to be asking is, do you have a bunch of things that want to share port 80, and how are you going to reverse proxy all the incoming traffic so that everybody can do that on the same server. node-http-proxy is outstanding for that. There is also a complete deployment solution for node that includes it that I put together, called stagecoach.
