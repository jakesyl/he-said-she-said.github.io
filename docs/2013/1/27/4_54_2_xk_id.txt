I have a Node.js 'worker' which I plan to run on a couple of machines. But they need to communicate with a 'server' to get the "work" (I'm coding a distributed web crawler). I'm coding everything in Node.js, and I hope to use redis and kue. Can anybody point me to where I can learn how to code my 'server'? I have already coded the 'worker'.
