fruitFly__: in the beginning you have a TCP socket connection on port 80. That's a reliable stream you can keep alive as long as you want and sling data back and forth knowing it'll get there. HTTP is just a convention on top of that. web sockets is another convention, which you ask the server to switch to with an http upgrade header. There's no magic.
