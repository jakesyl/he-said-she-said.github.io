just wrote a socket.io app yesterday. Pretty great stuff, although authentication is a hassle. You don't necessarily know who the user is, especially if the flash transport is used. There are hacks to shim sockets up to passport, but I wound up generating a random "socket key" in the session which is in the first message sent on the socket.
