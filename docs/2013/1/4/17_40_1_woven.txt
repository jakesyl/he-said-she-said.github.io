hi there, i'm using Socket.Io to connect a 3rd party site to a node app on our apache server. If I emit a message from the 3rd party site to the node app directly I get a success response, but If I use try to emit a message from a JS file outside of the HTML page I just get a message in the console the node debugger that says "served static content /socket.io.js"
