OK so someone mentioned that the gallery stuff is predominantely font end. Let me try and understand the server side, or rather, what should go on the server side, a little more clearly. For example, handling multiple file uploads. i.e. a whole directory of images. Broadly speaking, how would one make that into a series of small callback functions?
