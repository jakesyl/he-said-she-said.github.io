Uploadify.com ... wow. So it's a jQuery plugin that allows multiple file uploads. I guess what's confusing me / what is not clicking is how that gets received on the server side. Is my concept ludicrous or holds some potential? That is, as each file gets uploaded, on the server side Node.js receives it, creates a thumbnail, updates everyone's screens with the thumbnail, then again repeats for the next image on the list.
