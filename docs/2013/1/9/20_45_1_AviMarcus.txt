CoverSlide, I don't think I ever edited core code. OK, so timeEnd currently does: exports.log('%s: %dms', label, duration); -- would it make sense to return duration; also? it's not async.. duration is in milliseconds so then you can log it however you want. Although, if it's just Date.now()- original time I'm not sure how helpful this is at all!
