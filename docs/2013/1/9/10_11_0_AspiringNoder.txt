Hi guys. New to Node.js and come from a PHP/MySQL background. Really love the concepts and feel so excited by the amazing potential of asynch javascript. I have a few books on Node.js and it'll take me a few months to get upto speed on it. Meanwhile, as I learn, I'd like to work on a personal image gallery project for my charity.
