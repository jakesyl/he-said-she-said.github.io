I wish to build an image gallery where many photographers can upload many pictures simultaneously. The application should create a grid of grey boxes and a progress bar should appear in each grey box as each picture is uploaded and a small thumbnail displayed once each picture has been uploaded. As soon as a picture is uploaded, others can view these and start tagging the picture with meta data, which in turn can be searched
