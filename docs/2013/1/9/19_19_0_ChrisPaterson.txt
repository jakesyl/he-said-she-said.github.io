Got a question for the node experts:  I am attempting to run a child_process command (tried both spawn and exec).  It works in Linux, but on OSX it gives me it errors with code 127 (meaning command failed with possible problem with $PATH or typo).  If I console.log the exact command executed, copy-paste it into the shell it works.  All paths are absolute.  What gives??  anyone have this issue?
