I'm trying to get my foot in the websocket door. I see socket.io has high-level utilities for ease-of-use, but I'm more interested in understanding the underlying websocket protocol right now. In the intro example provided here: http://einaros.github.com/ws/ how does the client typically recieve the ws client code?
