I just started using Node.js. Got the ubiquitous chat app running with Express. Now, I am furthering my knowledge but I want to start using some frameworks. I found CompoundJS to be along the lines of what I was looking for. However, I also found that I prefer Mustache (and variants) over Jade. Does anyone know of a Compound Mustache view?
