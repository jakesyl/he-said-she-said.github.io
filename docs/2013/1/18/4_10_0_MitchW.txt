mdedetrich: single threaded sure, but I could have 200 requests - all of which then do a non-blocking call to some remote server, and come back in some unpredictable order - raised by some unknown event emitter (2-3 layers down in thirdparty middleware), there's no way to correlate the triggered events back up to my original request, and thus no way to correlate context/state from a triggered event up to it's root request/event-emitter
