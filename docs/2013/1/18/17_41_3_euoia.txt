I am building a standalone app with some node_module dependencies, which I thought I could add as git submodules so that the user never has to run npm install - but this breaks down if those modules themselves have dependencies which are not either committed or submodules. Any neat solution other than just adding the whole dependency tree for that module to my repo?
