is there anything like 'event local storage' (conceptually similar to thread local storage) in node?  All my googling has just found vague suggestions around using domains, except I don't see any way to get the current domain for an executing function, nor is there any supporting documentation on a safe way to add arbitary information into a domain for referencing later on
