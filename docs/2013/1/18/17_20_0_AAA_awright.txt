I just want a simple library that lets me do channel.emit(), channel.send(), or channel.write() for eventEmitter, message, or stream based APIs, respectively. None of this channel.toJson().setchannel().anotherChain().lololol() nonsense (seriously, abusing functions like that should be banned in ECMAScript)
