http://jsperf.com/object-literal-v-array This is a quick read.  Is this test flawed?  The object and the array tie at about 500k keys.  After which the object becomes exponentially slower.  I don't know anything about js.  iterating through an array of 1m items and comparing a key value within is faster than object[key] in an object with 1m keys?
