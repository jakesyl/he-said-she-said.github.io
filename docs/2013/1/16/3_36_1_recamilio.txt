Hi guys... I'm having a hell of pain with HTTPS proxying... I'm not sure if it's a node "issue", if I can call like that, but, I can't get a HTTPS proxy working, and there's some logic code to check if the client might access internet (as a mobile phone service provider).... Someone out there could give me alight, plz?!
