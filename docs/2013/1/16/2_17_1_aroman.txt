othiym23: so i'm really liking this 'dal' pattern. one question though, how do you handle the scenario where the dal is being require()'d, yet has already been previously require()'d elsewhere in the app? You'd basically be telling the database to open a connection which is already open, which will error. How do you address this use case?
