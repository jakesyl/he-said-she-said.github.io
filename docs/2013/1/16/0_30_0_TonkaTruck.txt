I'm working on my first realtime game app for iOS.  I've used web sockets with node before and it was quite painless.  Noticed RocketSocket lib for obj-c and was wondering what the downside of using web sockets outside of the browser wasâ€¦needless overhead, etc.  Should I just use server.Socket?  I'm just sharing x-y coords with maybe 10 updates per second.
