Hey. I wonder if anyone has any suggestions for this? I'm doing billing for some small info lookups, so I'll have upto ~50k/transactions per second. I need to store date, originating IP, accountcode, 8byte number = less than 50 bytes? ~2.4megabytes/second of raw data. Any suggestions on DBs for this high-volume, small data write load?
