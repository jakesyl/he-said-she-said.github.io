Having a little difficulty configuring nginx for first time on debian. in /opt/nginx/conf/nginx.conf i added include for /etc/nginx/sites-enabled and have ln -s a config file but something is wrong with my config file I believe. Output: emerg] host not found in upstream "app_m.myapp.com" in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/m.myapp.com:20 (domain obscured)
