so, uh, i'm trying to debug a call of child_process.execFile(), where the thing i'm doing seems to fail near the end because of CWD problems, i'm guessing. so as a workaround, i'm dynamically writing a bash script and calling that with execFile(), which then fails with Error: Command failed: execvp(): No such file or directory
