I'm using node/express/jade. Every time my jade file is rendered I want it to display a certain div (along with whatever else it's displaying) whose content is generated by node. Is there a better way to do this than to just pass the output of the node function as a parameter in render() every time? because I'm calling render() in a lot of different places
