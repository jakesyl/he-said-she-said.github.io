timoxley: Yes that is what I always do. I'm not a noob to NodeJS or JavaScript. I had just never given exceptions much thought because I always use the callback(err) pattern. Was just wondering about the negatives of exceptions. Thought I should be able to back up why I don't like them instead of being blindly opinionated.
