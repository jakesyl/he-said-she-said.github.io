Guys. I have a strange problem I cant figure out. I am doing an AJAX request, sending JSON to my Express webserver https://dl.dropbox.com/u/8183146/Image2.png -- but when I read the body (I have done app.use( express.bodyParser() ); ) with request.body, but then I get back: { '{"username":"234","email1":"34","email2":"234","key":"234"}': '' } -- It seems like, for some reason, the response is wrapped inside another json..
