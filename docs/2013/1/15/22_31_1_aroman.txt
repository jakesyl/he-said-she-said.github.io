hi, I'm using Mongoose for models in my web app. Naturally, I would like the models and schemas in their own module(s). However, I'm not sure whether i should be connecting to mongodb in the models module itself or in the context that I'm going to be using the module. (i.e, do I call mongoose.connect in app.js or in models.js?) What is the common practice for this?
