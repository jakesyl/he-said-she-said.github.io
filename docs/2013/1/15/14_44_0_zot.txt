I have code like this:  event.on('asdf', self._handler.bind(self)) â€¦ where I later want to remove the listener.  The obvious and ugly mechanism is to do:  self._bound_handler = self._handler.bind(self); event.on('asdf', self._bound_handler);, and then later event.removeListener(self._bound_handler);  because it's on a member func, I use bind, and because bind calls aren't cached, it must be stored.  is there a more elegant way?
