hello - have a span tag: <span style="font-size: medium; color: #ff0000" id="sugesstion"></span> - which should display messages after i call $('#sugesstion').html("Thank you for your suggestion.").fadeOut(2000); - however it only works the first time i call it - on consequent calls nothing is shown - what am i doing wrong?
