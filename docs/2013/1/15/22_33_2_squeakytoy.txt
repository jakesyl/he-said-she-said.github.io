imo, its a lot of boilerplate code to constantly write: if( error ) all the time.. then it seems better to provide a errorcallbackfunction.. but then again, there are pretty much no tools today that helps developers maintain function signatures.. so, i kinda think... throwing errors is probably a good pattern
