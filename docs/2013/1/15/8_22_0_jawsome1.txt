timoxley: I had tried gm with streams as my original implementation used gm, to no avail. While I can see where that's a benefit, this is done server side and during load time so, network latency to go to that service is most likely going to be more costly in response time than my current implementation of writing both to disk, sucking their values into Riak and then throwing away the files on disk.
