hey guys, this isn't a node question, more of a C problem with a meta question, i wanted to pick your brains about: C languages and the like with "seek" and "write" api's make it troublesome to INSERT/DELETE in a file (without rewriting the ending). can anyone think of a language which can do this (if at all possible)? illustration: http://pastebin.com/mBnefFaK
