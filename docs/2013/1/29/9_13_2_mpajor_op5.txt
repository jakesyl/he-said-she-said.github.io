fruitFly: I built a socket.io chat in two days; I've googled and read a lot about it but never actually tried to code anything. Eventually I decided to jump into it and voila, two days later I had a multi-room socket.io chat done with user authentication. I asked a couple of questions in here while building it and the response from the community was totally fantastic :)
