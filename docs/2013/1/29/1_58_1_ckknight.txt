well, the distinction is best made clear in calling a forEach function and passing a callback (which causes inversion of control) vs. using an iterating loop. The control of who is managing the communication between the enumeration is on the supplier for the former, therefore it must happen synchronously, and consumer for the latter, therefore synchronicity is irrelevant.
