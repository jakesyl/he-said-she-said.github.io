Hi, I'm a noob, so please take it easy on me :) I'm having great difficulty processing a submitted form (with just an email address in it) with the Mailchimp API. I have loaded the Mailchimp node module, but just can't figure out how to process it.  Can do it in PHP, but strugling to wrap my head around it in Node.js.  Does anyone know of any (easy to follow) examples?
