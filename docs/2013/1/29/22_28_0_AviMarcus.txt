tjfontaine, got another sec? :) I asked yesterday about native-dns and NAPTR. You gave me ndns.resolve('domain', ndns.NAPTR, cb); -- but actually, I need the server. doing response.answer.push(dns.NAPTR({  as opposed to dns.A gives a "AssertionError: missing value -->    at writeUInt16 (buffer.js:883:12)" I'm not quite sure where it's expecting this type to be defined..
