i want to be able to run my tests by running a single test file or running all of them with 'npm test'. the problem is i require'('./myapp'); in each test file, so when running all the test files with 'npm test' it creates my app (http server) multiple times which sounds inefficient. any tips to avoid that but still be able to run each file individually?
