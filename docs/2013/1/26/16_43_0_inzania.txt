Hey all, I'm looking for a solid implementation of a full-text search algorithm in Node.js which supports ranking, eg, "Search for this" +"and this" -"but not this". Something like Sphinx or ElasticSearch is far too sophsiticated for my needs, and those modules I've found so far don't quite cut it. Any ideas?
