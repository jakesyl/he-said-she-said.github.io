I want to make a script to automatically set random wallpaper. (I'm not easily offended, but I quickly get bored). I'm using node + chimera to accompish this. I have two problems: 1. How to do a os.sytem call from nodejs 2. Chimera won't close when it's done, not even if I do a Chimera.close() in my code.
