I'd previously been running node from a version I compiled on os x, and just tried to switch over to nvm. Nvm seems to have installed just fine but when running it to install a version of node I get the following failure error, "grep: input):111:v0.8.18-darwin-x86.tar.gz: No such file or directory". Anyone run into this issue before?
