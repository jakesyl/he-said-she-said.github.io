Anyone familiar with a module or have an idea how to conceptually go about EventEmitters that can allow emitted arguments to be mutated and returned somewhere? Perhaps its not possible, but something along the lines of -- events.on('foo', function(bar){ bar.modified = true; events.emit('foo_mutated', bar); }); events.on('foo_mutated', function(bar) { console.log(bar); }); // foo_mutated would need to wait until all mutations were
