Hello all newbie question: I am using Node+cluster+express and trying to use the v8-debugger/profiler using node --debug mycluster.js, and that's failing because (I am guessing) the controller and worker are trying to bind to the debug port, so there are a lot of errors/warnings about being unable to bind to port 5858. Surely I am missing something here...
