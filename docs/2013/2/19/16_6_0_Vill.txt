Hello Folks! I'm using mongojs, and when I tried to db.collection.find(_id: myIdHere) there was no error and empty results. After quick googling i found out, that i need to convert myIdHere to ObjectID with "var userID = new ObjectId(myIdHere);" but when i do so it says "ObjectID is not a function". What should I do? Any advice?
