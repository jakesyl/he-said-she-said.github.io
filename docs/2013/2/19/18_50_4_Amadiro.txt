bingomanatee, the most accurate way is to implement the navier-stokes equations, but to have them yield accurate results requires incredible computational power and very delicate fine-tuning for numerical stability (unlike other algorithms, they don't get more stable the smaller you make your dt, at some point they get unstable)
