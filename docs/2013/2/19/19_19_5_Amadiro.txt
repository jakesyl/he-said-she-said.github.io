paulkon, you see, debug symbols are like string in the program that give the debugger hints as to "where an exception was thrown". binaries and libraries are often stripped of these symbols, to save space. The -dbg version of the package includes them, however -- so if you install it, and run the program through gdb or valgrind, you will get more useful information out of it.
