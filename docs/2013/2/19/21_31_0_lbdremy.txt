I'm writing a scraper library on top of jsdom/cheerio/jquery, and I would like to find a short sentence to describe it well, check this out https://github.com/lbdremy/scrapinode/tree/v0.1.x. I found "content driven and routes based scraper" enough expressive, does it mean something to you ? (I'm not english native) thanks for your help
