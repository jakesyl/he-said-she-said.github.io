Hope no-one minds me ducking in here for a question, but google isn't so good about answering architecture. Most demos go "server.on('message', function(){});" Now to me this seems wrong, wouldn't that create new instances of that function in memory every time thus wasting mem? Or do we need these functions to be new instances so there's no collisions?
