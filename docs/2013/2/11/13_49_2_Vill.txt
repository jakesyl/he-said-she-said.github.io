damn, let me explain my problem: Can you guys recommend me a stable and useful development environment? I was using Jade and Stylus with Express, then I've found backbone.js and realized that there is something like node-blade, which combines Jade with Backbone, crap, should I instal node-blade? which alternative is best (I don't ask if there is any, because I assume there are hundreds...)?
