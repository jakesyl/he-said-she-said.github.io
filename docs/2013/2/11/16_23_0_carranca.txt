Hey, I'm creating a webpage with node, and found a nice way to share view templates between server rendering and client rendering using Hogan. My next proof of concept would be sharing logic, but I'm hitting a little bit of a wall. My idea is: If I have a user model, I might want to share some functionality like getFullName (concat first and last) but I wont share other stuff. Should I use something like Backbone models
