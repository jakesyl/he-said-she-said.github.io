Hi, nodejs first-time user here. Running on Linux (debian squeeze), have installed it (/usr/bin/node, /usr/bin/npm). Installed e.g. 'consolepluslus' with 'sudo npm install -g' and it's in /usr/lib/node_modules/consoleplusplus/. when I run node and write 'require('consoleplusplus');' I get: Error: Cannot find module 'consoleplusplus' . Seems I can't figure how the load/module paths work.
