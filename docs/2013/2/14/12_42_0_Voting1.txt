I need sample of code (I assume, using express js ?) to permit me to build a restful API to access a mysql (or other SQL) database. Ideally, I want to end up with something that will make it easy to connect a backbonejs based front-end to once the front end gets done. Where can I get an example I can study? My app is pretty simple really but I am new to Node, Express and Backbone!
