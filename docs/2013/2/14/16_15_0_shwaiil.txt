Q: My server runs Apache and now I've installed nodeJs. I'm going through my early steps, I did noticed a mention to "proxy" in a article I've rad before, which also points out that apache is not the best for node, but using nginx instead. The article was from 2011 I think, I don't need to learn this by now, but a comment would be nice! thanks for looking1
