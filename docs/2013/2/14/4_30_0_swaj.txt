Potentially stupid question:  is there any way to share objects between cluster workers?  I'm thinking of creating a database connection pool in the master, and then accessing that pool from the workers.  My guess is no because of the whole threading situation, but I wanted to make sure there wasn't a library out there that would solve this problem.
