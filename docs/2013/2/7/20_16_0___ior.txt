hrumph, so for a day or two i've been struggling against a problem where node hits 100% cpu and lags out ... but only when a mutex is engaged. i think i've tracked it down to "node hits 100% cpu when it can no longer write to a stream" ... which means a client is closing a connection before i send a res.end()... even with a 10 minute timeout set in http headers? strange, strange, strange
