I need an object database caching enigine for the client side.  I need it now.  I don't need an RDBMS under my browser.  I can deal with the data in RAM once I pull it out of local-storage.  I can do it my way, using javascript, much more efficiently.  When I code against the cloud in the future, the client side will be a persisted cache.
