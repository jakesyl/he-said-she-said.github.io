nkohari, i'm have compute system - this system have plugins. plugins write from 3rd party person. system must run this pluings per request (about 10-20 request per minute). some plugins may slowdown system or break it. now plugins work in separate process - but plugins is TOO much (more 100) - Im think so need 1 thread = 1 plugins
