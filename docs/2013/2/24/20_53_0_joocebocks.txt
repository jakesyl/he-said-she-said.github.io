Hi all, I have a problem upload a binary file - express 'bodyParser' is giving me a parsing exception. I think I know what is malformed request is, but it's being produced by a vendor I'm using.  I can't get rid of them just now and they are unresponsive, so I'm looking to code around their problem on the server side.  Can anyone recommend some way to hire someone to help me solve this?
