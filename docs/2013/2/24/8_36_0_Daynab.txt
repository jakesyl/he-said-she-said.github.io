Hi all, wondering if I could get some pointers - this is baby's first node project. I need to serve/do something with the contents of a few xml files, but I'm not sure where to start or what module to use. I was first thinking about parsing the relevant bits to a json file and then doing something with it, but I don't know if it's a good idea
