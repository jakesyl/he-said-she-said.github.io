oh, okay! I'm writing a little API in node+express that should serve various applications, and let them talk together. Something like a proxy API. Now, as I'm registering apps in MongoDB, I want them to be identified by (in addition to obvious authentication) hostname of the incoming request. To test it while developing I created a little faker.js, that creates httpRequests, hijacking the Host header with the one passed by argv.
