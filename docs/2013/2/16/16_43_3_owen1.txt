i don't understand stdout in unix. i wrote i node library that emit udp packets. i use console.log if the udp was send of if there was some error - http://hastebin.com/liloloyeqi.js   . my friend wrote a mocha test for this library and told me i am polluting the output of his tests since i used stdout too much. so what is stdout/ stderr means and how to make sure i am a well-behaved unix citizen?
