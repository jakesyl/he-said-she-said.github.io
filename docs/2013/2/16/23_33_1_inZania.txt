Hey all. My node.js app is apparently locked / pegged (100% cpu in top); I can't even open up the simple "healthcheck" endpoint in a browser (which just spits back "OK"). I really just want to know where it's stuck. It is a really rare problem (happened just twice in the last 2 weeks of dev), but unacceptable for prod. Is there ANY way to find out where the node app is at / what is causing this? I can't find anything :(
