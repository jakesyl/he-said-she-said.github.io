If I want to, like a chat program, be able to update user interfaces in a bunch of web browsers running Single Page Apps as things are updated on the server, for that something like http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC is not so good, right? Clients would need to poll to find out about updates in the server, right?
