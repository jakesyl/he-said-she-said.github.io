guys im just getting into streams and have a question. I am using the event-stream module and am trying to pipe some child_processes eg: es.pipeline( es.child(cp.exec("hadoop fs -ls -R " + dir)), es.split(), es.map(â€¦), es.child(cp.exec("hadoop fs -cat" + data)) ). My question is, how can I access the data coming into that second es.child() stream to be able to create a dynamic command like that?
