npdemers: i really dont know what you are trying to do, what i would do is create a node server to handle all live updating stuff, that either pushes through socket.io when a drupal save hook fires into some API in node you setup, which you will probably need anyways to know when things are updated, or replicate mysql and have node hit that directly
