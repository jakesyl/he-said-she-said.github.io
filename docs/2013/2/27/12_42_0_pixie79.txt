hi all - i am trying to create a client socket connection using net for the first time - i have managed to sucessfully create a connection so i am now trying to add some error handling, but I am not sure i have the timeout set correct and I also can not see to raise a connection error should i get ECON refused instead the program just bombs and ideas ? https://gist.github.com/pixie79/5047618
