General REST question... does it make sense to have PUT /product/123 take the entire body and replace product 123, while having POST /product/123, to take all body values and update only those values... for the sake of completeness, say I'm setting the product price... if I did a PUT, I would have to PUT the entire doc... id, description, title.. etc... where POST I only would have to send the new price
