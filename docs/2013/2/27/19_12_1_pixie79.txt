how do i tell a readable socket that the length of data it is about to receive varies. I am going to be receiving data which is split over a few lines but each has a banner line which has the following format X020 then the size of the data stream comes next for example X020040 would tell me that in total there is 40 char's to this data although it may be over several lines
