hello everyone :)  I wanted to run an idea by you.  Ok, so lets say you are using express and you hate jade, but you want to inject some json to your page and allow it to set itself up on the client side.  So, how can you get the json on your page quickly/easily w/o using a full featured layout engine like jade?
