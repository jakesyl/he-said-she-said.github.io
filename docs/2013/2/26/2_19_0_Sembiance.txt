zeromodulus: well, let me know if you need any tips or advice. I built a javascript Solitaire card game back in 2006 that now gets over 1 million monthly uniques, and I spent the past year or so making a new multiplayer card game site. So in terms of web-based card games with a node.js back end, I've been around that block a few timers ;)
