Hey folks. Need a hand with express3 and socket.io... my app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/application')); is stealing also the socket.io/socket.io.js file handle. Apparently socket.io doesn't properly install itself to express to route /socket.io/ to the correct plase. Any pointers? All google examples fail
