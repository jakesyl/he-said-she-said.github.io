I've been doing some profiling of my app and found that most of my CPU is being spent by Mongoose "cloning" the objects it finds from the database. I've heard tell that Mongoose can be slow before, and I believe it was said that for simple finds it can be better to just go straight to the MongoDB driver. Is this correct? How would I do it?
