I'm trying to fix a problem in the test suite: test-cluster-http-pipe.js is leaving the common.PIPE socket behind when the process and workers exit. Subsequent tests that also use common.PIPE then fail with EADDRINUSE because "test/tmp/test.sock" still exists. I 'assume' that process.exit() ought to cause objects to clean up after themselves.. in other words server.listen(common.PIPE, ...) should be closed cleanly. Anyone know if that is the case?
