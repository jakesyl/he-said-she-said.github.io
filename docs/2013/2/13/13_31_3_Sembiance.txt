leehambley: tests eh? hehe  I tried doing tests for my javascript once (used vows)... it was fun for a bit, but honestly didn't see much point in it. I guess if I had absolutely critical code, or had test coverage over almost everything, but I guess I'm still in the "Tests are more trouble than they are worth" camp ;)
