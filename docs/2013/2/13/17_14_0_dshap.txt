hey all, i'm trying to install node-canvas and i'm running into some issues.  npm is telling me "Perhaps you should add the directory containing `fontconfig.pc' to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable".   the thing is, if i do "ls $PKG_CONFIG_PATH | grep font" then i see fontconfig.pc right there!  Any ideas?
