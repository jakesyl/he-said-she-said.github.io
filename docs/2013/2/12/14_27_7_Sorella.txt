creationix: nope. If LiveScript did have multiple dispatching (which it doesn't implement, but I've been thinking about trying), then it could. For example, you could first define: `add :: Int -> Int -> Int => (a, b) --> a + b; add :: Promise -> Promise -> Promise => (a, b) --> /* add both when they're fulfilled */`
