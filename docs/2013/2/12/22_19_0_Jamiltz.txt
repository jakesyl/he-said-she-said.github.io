Hey. How can parse two parameters with the url module. For example in this call http://127.0.0.1:3000/?url=http://api1.asos.com/productlisting/category/6993/1/AlphaDescending/en_API/GBP?api_key=qwc... I have url and api_key to parse. I tried to query separately and then concatenate but it didn't work :(
