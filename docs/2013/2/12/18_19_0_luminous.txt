Sorella`: I had a feeling you'd point at haskell, and I would agree, except that I've only barely begun to learn haskell. I still find python more readable because it isn't so difficult / is easier to follow even for non-programmers (obviously dependent on how well-written). either way, it seems like a really silly snag to have against the language, particularly when so many other languages abuse special symbols
