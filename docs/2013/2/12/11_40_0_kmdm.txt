Huh? So the problem appears to be that on RHEL5 the syscall(__NR_pipe2, ...); call doesn't return anything (the return value is still __NR_pipe2) and it doesn't touch errno so the errno == ENOSYS check fails since ERRNO was untouched by the syscall. (I've isolated this case from the node.js code-base as well!) ... *blames Redhat*.
