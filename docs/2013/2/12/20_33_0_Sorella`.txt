Relational DBs work with basis on relational algebra. You probably learned that in SQL. Relational DBs are good if your data is relational. Document Stores (like mongo) are what you use if your data is not really relational, like Posts in a blog. Then you rely on documents, sometimes do some processing on them, don't need JOINs, etc. Key/Value stores are generally used for fast operations on simple data (e.g.: Redis). Graph DBs are used
