amurdaca: callbacks basically says: hey, when you finish this computation, jump to this point in the code and give me the value. Promises basically say: hey I'll be doing a computation, but it'll take a while, hold on to this token while you wait, it represents the value i'll give you back, and you can do computations over it while you wait.
