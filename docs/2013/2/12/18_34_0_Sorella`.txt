luminous: Oh. Well, that's my opinion :3 I do find it rather cumbersome not being able to reflect better the structure of the source code through its indentation, because the semantic indentation isn't flexible in Python. And I find it makes it more difficult for me to understand how everything relates to the stuff inside a code block.
