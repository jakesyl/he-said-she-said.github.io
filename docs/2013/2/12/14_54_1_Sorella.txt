Trex005: when you do `require('foo')`, node will resolve the path, load the module and execute it. When you do `require('foo')`, node will resolve the path, verify that there's already a module like that loaded and give you back the Module object. At least, if I remember correctly, someone with more knowledge of the internals of `require` than me can probaly correct me if I'm wrong.
