isaacbw: heh. I'm not going to use node all the way down to the bootloader (I can't even do that ;3). It's more of an abstraction over a bare host OS (Linux now, but could be anything), with a tagged virtual File System implementation, its own security layer, and a websocket API for communicating with the WM in a WebKit browser. I could bundle that all as a single Linux distro, though.
