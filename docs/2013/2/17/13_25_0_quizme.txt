nexxy: i think my main pattern of execution is like this:  do event1 (eg. $('#login').click()) , wait for response_event1 (page loads, makes ajax calls that i have no control of, registers event handlers based on the response of those ajax calls, then after all thatâ€¦), then do event2, wait for response_event2, then do event3, wait for response_event3.
