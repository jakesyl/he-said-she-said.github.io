a question re http://nodejs.org/api/querystring.html: what spec does it implement?  the page fails to mention this AFAICT.  assuming it's an attempt to implement rfc3986... that spec says: "reserved      = gen-delims / sub-delims".  querystring's stringify method %-escapes all of gen-delims and *most* of sub-delims.  !'()* are left intact.  why?
