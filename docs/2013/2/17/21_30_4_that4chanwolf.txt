Question: I'm trying to download files with request, and it seems to screw up on things like torrent files or isos or anything that isn't plain utf8 text. Doing request("http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/6.0.6/amd64/bt-cd/debian-6.0.6-amd64-netinst.iso.torrent").pipe(fs.createWriteStream('/tmp/test.torrent')) always messes up. Is there an easier way to download binary files or am I just doing something wrong?
