Let's say, I want to build objects from a JSON file. I just know my json file can contains arrays of custom object ie: accounts:[{account01},{account02}...],products[{product01}]. Hos Can I know I'm actually parsing an account or a product ? I know that accounts or products are arrays but accounts[0] == null
