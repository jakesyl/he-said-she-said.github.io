i'm currently using mongoose but i'm wondering what other modules are good choices for persisting data. all the tutorials out there just seem to use mongoose. i'm really interested in running my unit tests outside of the database (in memory), and writing validation rules for my schemaâ€¦ mongoose does the latter only.
