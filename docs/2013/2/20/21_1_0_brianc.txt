also - noders - anyone here going to node-conf?  I am flying from out of town, have a camp-out ticket, and wondering if I could strike a deal with someone local to SF.  I'd like to buy a tent + sleeping back off of amazon & have it shipped to your house and you bring it with you to node-conf.  I'll pay you whatever extra fee you interested in.  I think that might be better for me than flying with a tent + sleeping back checked in car
