I'm using scrypt (https://npmjs.org/package/scrypt) which is a memory hard algorithm to hash my password, however, anybody can explain why I need to run the function verifyHash and give the hash stored in the db and the password the user is providing, instead of simple hashing the user's password with the same algorithm and compared both digests?
