Q: I've installed Forever to run a .Js as a daemon. I've noticed that I've got a process running but has nothing to do with forever, stopall says there's no forever processes running. I'm under linux so I do kill -9 PID but the .js file starts again with a different PID after I kill it, I wonder why ? thanks
