Q: I'm learning nodeJs and I've chosen LocomotiveJs. I'm trying to understand how to use node-mysql with locomotiveJs. Tried to find articles or tips through google without success and I'm not sure if the moongose tip in the locomotive docs / manual could help. Any suggestion ? thanks for looking  : )
