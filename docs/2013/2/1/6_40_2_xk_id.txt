echo: I reckon it needs to use it later, so if it's case sensitive, it won't find it. Plus, that's where the value gets assigned, rather than when the name is transformeed into string and sent to the server. Also, it seems that if I set it to a custom value in the options, it remains that way (i.e line 193 doesn't change it anymore)
