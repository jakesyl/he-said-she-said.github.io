I have a question about using require on the client side.  It seems like the only approaches are to either use something like hem or browserify, which uses the require to combine everything into a single file, or to use something which loads modules at runtie asynchronously, are those the only 2 approaches?  Is there a way to get require on the client side while still sychronously loading the individual js files?
