Guys, do you reckon it would be reasonable to expect from my EC2 cluster to do the following.. Basically I will have one server and up to 5 workers. workers will inquire the server for links from a redis DB; will ask server for the time of the last crawl and will update server when they start the crawl (server will store value in memory); will ask server for two variables (stored in memory); will send scraped
