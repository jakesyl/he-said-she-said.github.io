The original byte array is not encoded as UTF-8. The StreamReader therefore replaces each invalid byte with the replacement character U+FFFD. When that character gets encoded back to UTF-8, this results in the byte sequence EF BF BD. You cannot construct the original byte value from the string because the information is completely lost.
