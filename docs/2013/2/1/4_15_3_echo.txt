rump: It's not the size that I think matters really, it will seem in the client experience to take MUCH longer when you're staring a blank white page for 3 (potentially) seconds instead of a spinner for ~1-2 seconds at most, and you can be doing other things while you wait on that anyways. Round-trip-time is so much easier to pass-by with junk to atleast look at instead of a white page.
