"npm shrinkwrap" sounds like it should work, but it relies on you trusting every package publisher you use (assuming npm itself is secure), if any one of those package publishers have their computer compromised then a lot of production boxes can be attacked, at least putting a SHA in the package.json as part of "npm shrinkwrap" for every package would help verify what you just downloaded
