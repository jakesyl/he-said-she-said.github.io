 work but since you can republish psackages there is no guarantee the source code is what you expect even with explicit versions, seems like npm needs a hash of the package and that gets put into the package.json when you do "npm shrinkwrap" and then on "npm install" there should be an option like --verify which will fail if the hashes don't match for a particular version
