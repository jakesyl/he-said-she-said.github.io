hi there!I got a curiose problem regarding global. using the module node-orm(npm install node-orm) when connecting to a database I do not have a complete set of global variables, and I was wondering, how this happend, why and how I can get the databaseconnectionparameter out of there, since I will have multiple threads accessing the database and I don't want a corrupt database or things like dirty read and such usage of orm.connect ca
