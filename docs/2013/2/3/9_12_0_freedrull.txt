trying to set up this socket.io app to use long polling on heroku, but i can see in the network tab its still making failed requests to /socket.io/1 and not /socket.io/1/xhr-polling. can anyone tell if 'm configuring it wrong somehow just by eyeballing this?  https://github.com/mcfiredrill/subway-demo/blob/master/lib/subway.js#L41 it works on development and not heroku so i'm thinking its a environment issue, but i can't see that socket.io is configured
