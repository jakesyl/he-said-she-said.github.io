i was wondering of someone could help me with a design problem. I want to run multiple threads simultaneously but i want to "wait" for all of them to return/complete in the main event loop before continuing execution. This looks like it might be able to do what i need but i don't get the impression it's using webworkers https://github.com/caolan/async#paralleltasks-callback
