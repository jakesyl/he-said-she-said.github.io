Without dumping all my personal stuff on NPM, say I made an Observable.js that has its own unit tests etc. It is a dependency of other things, so I include it in lib/ with some other stuff in there aswell that uses it. How do I keep my library in separate parts and easily distribute them among projects? just use git submodules for each dependency?
