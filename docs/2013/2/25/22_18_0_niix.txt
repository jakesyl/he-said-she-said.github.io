I'm trying to make a registration view and it works so far but I'm trying to handle my errors correctly.  I wrote this part here, but it's a bit ghetto.  Does anyone have any better ideas?  I'm feeding the errors off of the mongoDB errors for the fields https://gist.github.com/niix/5033833#file-app-js-L12
