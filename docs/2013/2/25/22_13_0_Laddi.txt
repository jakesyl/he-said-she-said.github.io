We have an S3 compatible service that I'm trying to fetch files from.  The problem is that the service doesn't allow or have any means of adding the content-disposition header itself.  So I'm trying to create a simple service that takes in the URL of the file in S3, fetch it and then return it via the response with the content-disposition header set
