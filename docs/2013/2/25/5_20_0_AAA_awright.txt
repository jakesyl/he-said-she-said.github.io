cloudbender: Also your initial question, SHA-2 like SHA-256 is still considered perfectly secure, but only with an applied function like HMAC or PBKDF2, one property of hashes is that you can append more content and re-calculate the hash. This means if used directly, you could append data to an already-authenticated stream and it would still look authenticated. Not good.
