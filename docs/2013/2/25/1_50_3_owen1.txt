how to store that in redis : I have a few json objects with a few string keys. {name: 'foo', title: 'bla', status: 'pass'} what's the best way to store them? in a list named 'projects' (and stringify the hashes) or in some other way?  i need to read the information of all of them and not sure if list will allow me to do that.
