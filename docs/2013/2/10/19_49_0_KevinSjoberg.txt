I'm fairly new to Node and I'm fiddling around with different parts of the documentation. I got a question. My understanding is that I need to do "process.stdin.resume();" before I actually can listen on incoming data (emitted by the 'data' event). Is that true, because I just tried without it and it seemed to work?
