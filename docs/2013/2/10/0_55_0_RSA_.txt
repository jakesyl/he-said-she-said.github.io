:) good question! I have already forgottenâ€¦ no. :) I wanted to get a running system to experiment a little bit with node and socket.io, etc. and I thought npm is such as a basic thing to use with node but there where also things I wanted, that depend on npm, but I have to look that up, what it was. It is in one of my lists on one of my screens..
