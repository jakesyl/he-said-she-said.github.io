ah. the tool I wanted was "webhookit". "to create simple webservices, mashups, web application integrations, composability between webservices, event-driven web programming" similar to yahoo pipes and that requires npm.. but there might better workarounds to use node for scraping I guess. have just had a little glimpse into python, but I am open for java scraping frameworks :)
