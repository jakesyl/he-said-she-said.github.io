groundwater: it's not all emails, but its one example of what I need to do. Another example is that I need to create "events" in the database for one month in the futureâ€¦ and if for some reason one of the event does not get generated I want to know about it. Seems like using a queue could be useful instead of just running a cron job that will report on which events were not created.
