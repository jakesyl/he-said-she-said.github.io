I drew a doodle of a witch's calduron today. I'll make it bubble with client-side js, and bats and ssh randomart glyphs fly out of it. You'll get a bat every time you click the calduron, and in fact everyone will get one so you can spam it terribly. Every time someone connects their SSH public key will pop out in brilliant colours.
