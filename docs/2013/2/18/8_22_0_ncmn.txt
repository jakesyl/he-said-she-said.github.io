really, i will just be taking a few string elements from page A with GET,  submitting info related to A via POSTS on page B and also taking a few string elements from page B, and hashing them together serverside with a multidimensional array. that's for starters. after that, i'll be using the hash to POST update page B with changes on page A after another node script notices a change in the element on A
