Information about release from blog is not very clear if you compare it with github commit log. For example take "stream: read(0) should not always trigger _read(n,cb) (isaacs)" -> where is this change made here https://github.com/joyent/node/commits/v0.9.10-release ??? I want to check does my stream classes still work and look into code and where's the mentioned change ?? Or is it a bug on a blog note ?
