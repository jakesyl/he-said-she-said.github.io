I am creating a combination forum / q/a / real time chat system ... styled in a q/a site similar to stackoverflow or experts exchange... all questions asked on the site will be pushed to the chat , chat can push back answers to the site... or you can answer them on the site... but for the end user who asked the question, those answers will just start streaming in on the page
