i actually can't enumerate the list. I use vim rather regularly, but when I'm on a system that only has vi, I get frustrated, so there are definite differences. I'm just not experienced enough with vi to know what they are. I know vim supports syntax highlighitng and scripting which I believe are absent from vi, but I'm not 100% sure on that.
