hi i have a slight problem. i setup nodejs/express on a server a while back. i think i've setup some kind of automatic restart/spawn script, but i've forgotten what it was. i'm trying to stop node with kill $PID, but it keeps respawning. any suggestions on what it might be? i've tried looking for forever, nodemon, supervisor. seems i haven't used any of those
