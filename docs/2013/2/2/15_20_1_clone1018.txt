So I have a mustacheish question, on: https://github.com/zetaweb/aspen.js/blob/add_renders/aspen/simplates/autoindex.html#L21 files doesn't return anything, typeof files is string, derp returns herp like it, does anyone have any ideas (background about this, file split by ^L, top is ran once, middle ran every request, bottom is rendered)
