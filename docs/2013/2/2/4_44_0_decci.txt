mscdex: Im running windows XP, SP2 or whatever the latest is. Construct2 only runs on Windows.  When I run the program in construct, it asks me for the server ip. I enter the ip of the server (vps) that I installed socket.io and node.js...but i am not sure if i need to add the folder name for node. js
