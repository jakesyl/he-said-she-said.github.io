geNAZt: there are 3 different cases. fs.exists which I've linked a thread before where it says I should avoid using it. the one I've been suggested instead where I try to write the file, then if fails because of missing dir, I create the dir, the write again. And the one I am asking about to create the dir, and write the file.
