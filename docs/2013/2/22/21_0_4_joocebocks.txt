Hi all, a bit of a node.js/express noob but I'm trying to upload an image from a form and using the express.bodyParser.  I'm using a mobile API function to upload the image, and I'm getting a parser error.  I did an equivalent POST using the Chrome Advanced Rest Client (which worked) and wiresharked both to look at the difference.
