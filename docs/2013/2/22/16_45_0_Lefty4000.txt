Hey guys, I know this question doesn't exactly make sense but I'm honestly lost and under a huge time limit.  I have to figure out how to get jQuery working alongside node.js.  I've never done any of this before and i'm just so lost.  Does anybody have a straight guide to do that from start to finish?  i'm using expressjs
