ok, why not take advantage of HTTP caching?   Emit a 'Last-Modified' header from node, which the client cache will record. Then next time it wants the JSON, it will pass an 'If-Modified-Since' header to node, which you can then check if its within 24 hours, and if it is, just reply with an HTTP "Not Modfiied". The client will then use its cached version, saving traffic
