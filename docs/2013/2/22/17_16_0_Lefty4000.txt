@Nexxy: So here is what i've gathered.  I can put the jQuery.min.js file in the public js folder.  and then any associated javascript files in there as well that interact with jQuery and then to activate it, I'll just send the corresponding javascript file a command with the middleware dealio in the app.get/post (''request name", middleware, function) and then it just flies
