Need some advice on this workflow, I have a node instance running on Nodejitsu and among other things it is serving up multiple apps/games to clients that are requesting them, I want to manage the apps/games outside the source for the server and possibly do a continous deployment where when i push to master say on Bitbucket it will update the served files on the server or perhaps on S3. Any suggestions on hwo to set this up?
