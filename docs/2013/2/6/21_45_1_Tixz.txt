I'm using mongoose. I'm currently implementing a passport local strategy. My passwords get encrypted using bcrypt. My plan was to have a mongoose virtual called password, and using the pre('save') hook, salt and hash the password and persist it to a hash property. I feel like the virtual is a bit messy (implementing get/set just to set a variable). Is there a more clean way?
