question about `-` vs `_` in classnames… right now for my personal projects, i use `_` when referencing CSS only classnames, but for all classnames that I use exclusively with javascript, i'll use a `-` instead… e.g. `form_row` is always a CSS class … never referenced by my JS… `js-form-focus` is a javascript class not found within my CSS
