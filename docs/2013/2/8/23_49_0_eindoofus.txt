from an outsider point of view, node.js feels chaotic and disorganized. Whether it is or isn't, there isn't enough out there nurturing a new community. If the community doesn't come together and resolve this then I doubt node.js will grow quickly enough before it is stomped out by a competitor implementing there own async server-side solution that does feel stable and provide greater support.
