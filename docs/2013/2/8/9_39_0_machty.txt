I was under the impression that node prevented required libs from polluting the global namespace, ie if foo.js contents = "F = 'yes';" and you spin up node and require('foo') and check the value of F, it'd be undefined, but F is set to 'yes' even in the requirer. why is this? doesn't this break the whole module concept that node has going for it?
