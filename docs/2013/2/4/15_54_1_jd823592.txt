Hello, i am attempting to use passportjs with expressjs and i can see that my user gets serialized and even deserialized correctly upon subsequent requests after login in. but accessing a route with passport.authenticate("local", {successRedirect: "/", failureRedirect: "/login"}) keeps redirecting to login :/ what can be wrong?
