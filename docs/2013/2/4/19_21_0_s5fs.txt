Like a fool I've added node_modules to my git repo, and now that I've got Mac users on the project, this approach sucks. I've got modules that are built on multiple platforms now and that causes node to segfault on occasion. I'm going to remove the diretory from git, is there a way to have npm rebuilt all the modules, or should I just empty the node_modules directory?
