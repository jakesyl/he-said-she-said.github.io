"RethinkDB clients can connect to any node in the cluster and queries  will be automatically routed internally.  Both simple (such as filters,  joins) and composed queries (chained operations) will be broken down,  routed to the appropriate machines, and executed in parallel. The  results will be recombined and streamed back to the client."
