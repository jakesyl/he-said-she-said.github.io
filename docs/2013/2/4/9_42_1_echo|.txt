mansoor-s: I'd be interested to see how it goes. The first time I heard of rethinkdb was earlier when cloudbender responded. It seems very very similar to MongoDB, just with raw JSON objects and no metadata encoded vs. BSON with meta data. It also doesn't appear to have any additional indexing other than the key itself.
