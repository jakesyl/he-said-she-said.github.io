What's the best resource to start learning NodeJs and a Mvc Framework to start working ? Or should I start straight with the MVC Framework, such as ExpressJs ? Thanks for looking! *found a Peepcode video tutorial but I think it forces you to also learn Coffeescriptt that i'm not interested. Thank you!
