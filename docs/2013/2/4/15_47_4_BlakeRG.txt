here's what i am having trouble understanding though. If each external web service i am syndicating takes a second to come back and node is only a single process, then node won't help me speed up this API call at all. unless i'm using threads/webworkers there's no possible way to make the process less than 4 seconds total.. So i might as well just stick with PHP right?
