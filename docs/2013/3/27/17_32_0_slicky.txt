Is there ever a situation where fs.writeFile(path, contents, cb); will not overwrite all the data? I have an issue where I have a file that is, say, 1MB in size. I call fs.writeFile() on that file and write 0.5MB of data to the file. For some reason, some of the time, it only overwrites the 0.5mb I meant to write, but keeps all the extra data from 0.5+mb without wiping it. Anyone know anything about this?
