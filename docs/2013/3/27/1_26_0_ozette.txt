using express, i am trying to send over foo.js with app.get("/scripts/:filename"); var filename = response.params.filename and response.sendfile("/scripts/"+filename). but my foo.js in /scripts/ can't be found. now this is the same directory, and ./scripts/ also gives me a 404. request url was: http://127.0.0.1:1334/scripts/foo.js
