MikeSalivin: Your biggest problem is that you start from the position that you know what you're talking about and the rest of us are clueless idiots who can't help you. Then you get frustrated and demanding with us. The truth is, the people who have been trying to help you have been around this block before, and you clearly haven't. Leave your ego at the door.
