so the issue breaks down into 3 parts: 1. don't throw "exceptions". pass them to callback. 2. EE if it can, should avoid application errors placing node core into an undefined state resulting in request timeouts. 3. assuming core is protecting itself from application errors putting it into an undefined state, application errors should be treated differently (possibly with a separate error event like uncaughtApplicationException)
