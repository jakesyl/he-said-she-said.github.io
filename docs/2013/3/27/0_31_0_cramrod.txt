LuckyBurger!  Im trying to load the results of a MongoDB find() into an array then execute a response.send containing the array.  Whats the best way to do this? Is there a way to access all of the results inside of the find() callback function?  I feel like the solution has something to do with the cursor but I cant quite figure it out. http://pastebin.com/b3QAvEZh
