I wonder, would it be plausible to have multiple cores of CPU (like more than one i7, say) each connected to a networking chip/card/device, and using the incoming data coming through the interface, process the data and then emit the output through the networking interface. Then, you have a computer/laptop that parallels multiple large tasks to these CPU clusters. Adding more CPU power to your computer is as s
