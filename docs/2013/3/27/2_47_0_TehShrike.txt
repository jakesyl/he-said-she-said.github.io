Maybe someone else can answer that more usefully.  I generally just have custom code/functions to make sure that inputs fall within certain parameters before I integrate them into queries or lookups, and make sure my queries don't assume anything (like "a lookup based on a passed-in ID will necessarily correspond to the current user")
