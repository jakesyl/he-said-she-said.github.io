hello all, I've got a bit of a problem when dealing with my db - I've just changed a few things so that my timestamps are generated by postgres, so I've updated my INSERT query to include a 'â€¦ RETURNING timestamp' but I can't seem to access it once the query is run inside node (using the pg module)
