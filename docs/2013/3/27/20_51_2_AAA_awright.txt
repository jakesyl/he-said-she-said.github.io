daurnimator: You do get the concept that it's not functionality that belongs in that abstraction level... Node.js exclusively deals in modules, modules of which are set up by a package manager, and you can use any number of package managers. If you want to interface with a particular package file, then that's a task for your package manager library to do, not Node.js... require('mepackagemanager').resolve('modulename').version
