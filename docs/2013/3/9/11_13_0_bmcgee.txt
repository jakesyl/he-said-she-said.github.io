hey guys, i'm a bit of noob playing around with express. I'm working on a single page app with angular for the frontend. What I want to do is intercept all requests. If they're for a html page then regardless of the path I want to render the same index page (angular will detect the path and render view accordingly), otherwise let the request pass on through and get picked up by the router. Should i be looking at middleware for this?
