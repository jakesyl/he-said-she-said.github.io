Say I write tiny services some of which may represent websites/hostnames. How do I manage starting/stopping whole environments and versions of environments/servers (dev/test/acc/prod/etc) and also manage what happens when services fail. I guess the correct way to respond there is to short cirquit to a 500 response?
