i have a few different versions of static_files (module) which hold my images css fonts templates. one version is served by express on domain.com/co/0.2/css etc... i need to support my other versions i.e. domain.com/co/1.0/css . etc.. Is there a way that I can specify multiple versions of the same module in package.json ?
