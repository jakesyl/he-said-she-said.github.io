So let's say I have a service getting hit with a bunch of bad traffic - (spam traffic from latvia) and I want to blacklist their IPâ€¦ would it do more harm than good to do a long settimeout to respond to that garbage traffic to slow down the response rate?  or am I just hurting myself and should I just sever the connection as quickly as possible?
