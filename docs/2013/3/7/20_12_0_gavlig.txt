hey guys! I cant connect to postgres db with any-db or pg modules. with any-db i do the following: connection string - postgres://postgres:pass@localhost:5432/someDB and create pool with pool = anyDB.createPool(dbURL, {min: 20, max: 100, onConnect: function (conn, done) { console.log("connected!"); done(null, conn) }}); but onConnect event never fires. Is it something wrong with my code or i should look into db?
