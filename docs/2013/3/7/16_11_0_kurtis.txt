AAA_awright, hmm. Okay, I'm willing to give that a shot. I'm not quite familiar with using HTTP Basic Auth aside from the browser displays a dialog requesting a Username/password upon request. I've looked this up before (primarily trying to find which headers are used for this process and what the process flow is). Do you have any suggestion on a example project using this? (Client + Server)?
