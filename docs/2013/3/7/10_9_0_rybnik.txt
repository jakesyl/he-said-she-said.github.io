Anyone have a spare minute? I'm having some odd behavior, I'm using express and I working on a crash-only approach, and basically TypeErrors and SyntaxErrors exceptions are being caught somewhere and printed, however other type of exceptions are correctly being trapped by uncaughtException or just make the process crashâ€¦ anyone can give me a few hints on this ?
