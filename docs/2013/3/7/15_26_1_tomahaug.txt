Hi .. I have been googling the *** out of this question, but can't seem to find the solution .. I am using Node.js degram and trying to setup a multicast as described in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14130560/nodejs-udp-multicast-how-to .. I am on Mac OS X 10.6.8 with node version 0.8.4 .. Calling the method addMembership("127.0.0.1") results in the error "Error: addMembership EINVAL"
