I was thinking, since I tried Buster.js and didn't find it production redy, and we are using jsTestDriver right now which is giving problems, to write something like buster myself, beginning with just the node.js environment tests but making a server that queues tests from multiple concurrent clients sequentially nicely, so slave browser sessions don't execute code of different tests etc..
