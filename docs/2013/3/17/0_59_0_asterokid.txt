So let's imagine my server is expecting a url like http://www.mysite.com/user/jimmy and on my apache server I create a proxypass of jimmy.mysite.com that points to http://www.mysite.com/user/jimmy. Is this normal then it does not work... Knowing that I am using request.url on the server to figure out all my sh*t. What is the right way to proceed?
