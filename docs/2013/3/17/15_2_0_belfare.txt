I do want the fastest approach, but I would also use caching of some type… I can cache api calls via some identifier… so dynamic content could be orchestrated at the host for 'authenticated' pages… if the pages aren't authenticated; I can probably just cache the whole thing for a long time (at least in my instance) so I don't need to use JS of anytype to pull content… only internally to speed up the rendering
