With the `assert` module, how would one assert the opposite of something like `isUndefined`? e.g. I'm looking for something like `notUndefined` or `isDefined`, but I'm wondering if there's a general way to do this across all of the assertion tests? I tried !assert.isUndefined(), but, as I expected, that didn't work.
