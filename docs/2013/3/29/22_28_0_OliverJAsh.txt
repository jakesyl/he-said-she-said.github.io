substack: because i assign modules to an object. for instance, there's the "Links" module, which has a Show module ("Links.Show"), which might have a Controller module ("Links.Show.Controller"). so they are required in order and that object is created, instead of having dependencies such as "Links", "LinksShow", and "LinksShowController"
