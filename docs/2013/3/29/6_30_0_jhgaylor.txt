hi guys.  I'm working with node.js for the first time and using deployd. i'm trying to decide how best to trigger events if a record changed at all.  deployed exposes `previous` as a copy of the original record and `this` as a reference to the record being submitted for updating.  my end goal is to create a collection of records saying who changed a record and when.
