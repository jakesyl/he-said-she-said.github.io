Need opinion/best practice on a security design pattern...my site sets a secret-keyed cookie of a user's id (mongodb _id), and name/id are placed in session. Then I open a socket, passing the session to the socket...if the SERVER disconnects,the client keeps attempting to reconnect. Upon reconnect, it finds the cookie, re-queries the db and re-sets the session.
