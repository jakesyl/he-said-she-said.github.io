I have a mysql-database and I want to report to all users if anything changes. Now I wanted to work with mysql-trigger and â€¦. (This is what I don't know.) Something should use pub sub of redis to go through nodejs to all the clients connected. Has anybody tried something like that. And what did you use to notify Node that something changed in mysql?
