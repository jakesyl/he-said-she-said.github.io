I'm faily new to testing; I'm trying to write these tests before implementing, so I'm thinking about how to test API argument validity. https://gist.github.com/Industrial/3cf19c1a5e4e5a2ee58e#file-node-test-js-L88 is this a good way? Should I return a different error message for each of these cases (since I need all the info to be there)?
