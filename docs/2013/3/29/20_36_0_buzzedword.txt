i have a general question. i've been using mongo as my persistence, and interfacing with mongo. just got out of a code review for the unit i'm on and was posed with an interesting query: the point of noSQL is that it's schemaless. why does enforcing a schema through mongoose benefit at all, and isn't it abusing the platform?
