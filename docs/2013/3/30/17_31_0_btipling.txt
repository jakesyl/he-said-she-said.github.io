I have a question about built-in packages like fs. If I want to overwrite these for testing, is there some preferred mechanism by which should be done? I feel like I might have to pass in things like fs to functions so I can pass in stubs while testing, but that seems weird. I don't want to actually read any files or directories during testing.
