I'm at a bit of a less here, I have 2 servers, both have node, npm installed, did npm install -g less on both, i have a script with require('less') in it, and on one machine it works, but on the other it says it cannot find the less moduleâ€¦ i checked /usr/local/lib/node_modules/less to make sure it was isntalled for both, there's no node_modules in the local dir or in the home dir for the user, what could I be missing ?
