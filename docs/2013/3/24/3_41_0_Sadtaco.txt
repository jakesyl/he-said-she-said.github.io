Server starts, loads a list of images from a database, then it reads the pixels from those images and creates some objects with psuedo classes.  After all that's done, I need to do synchronous stuff.  I've used callbacks in the past but I'm not getting how to know they're ALL finished, especially if a new task is added in the middle of it doing older ones.
