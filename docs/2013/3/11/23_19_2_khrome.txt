Hey guys: after a painful road I'm realizing a DOM client designed for testing seriously sucks for generalized scraping as I'm wasting time at runtime and development twiddling with browser quirks. Are there any DOM libs that aren't selling themselves for testing? I'm looking for pure API coverage, not a mimic libraryâ€¦. anyone have suggestions?
