hey all, I'm using Jasmine-node for my unit testing, but I'm not clear on what folks are using for integration tests, especially with no browser involved. I'm trying to test my nodejs code is talking to my database correctly. Having trouble find ideas from Google though; anyone had similar needs? :)
