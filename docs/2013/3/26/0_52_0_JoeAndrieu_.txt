I'm running into a problem loading a module (serialport). It works fine on my dev box, but when I run on my embedded device (which is using an NFS mount to access the exact same files), I get a "cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory" I've played with the permissions, but that didn't change anything. The error lists the file path and the file *is* there. Any suggestions for tracking this down?
