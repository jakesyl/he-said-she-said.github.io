I'm new to node.js.. Is it true that node limits any callback/processing to 5ms?  (and if exceeded, it aborts the callback)  I am wondering because although I understand node is single threaded and meant for high throughput network-type programming, it would still be useful/interesting to use node for general purpose programs (ie, command-line utilities that perhaps process large files).
