Okay, I think I am going insane.. Does anyone know what the heck is going on? I am trying to install compoundjs into my app directory. I have v1.1.5-21 listed in my package.json and I do "nom install" and everything seems to install just fine. Then I proceed to "compound init blog" and I get this "-bash: compound: command not found".. Is there something I am missing here??
