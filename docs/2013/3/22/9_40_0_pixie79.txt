morning all - I was wondering if there was anyone who had two mins that could review the following lib i have created to ensure my callbacks are correct, as I tend to get stuck in callback hell. The purpose of the lib is for the calling script to check if the callback is true or false and then act on it. This lib sets that status after checking the exit status of an external program which it runs. - https://gist.github.com/pixie79/52200
