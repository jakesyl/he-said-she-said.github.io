hi, perhaps I'm seriously misunderstanding something, but can anyone explain why when making an http request in node 0.10 the 'end' event will not fire unless I (inexplicably) listen to the 'data' event -- even if I'm not doing anything with it? Why should simply listening to the 'data' event cause 'end' to be triggered? Here's a quick gist with the minimal use case explaining what I'm wondering aboutâ€¦ https://gist.github.com/aroman/5223252
