hi, i would like to know how to "monkey-patch" a library in node, i'm using the package dnsd, somewhere in the package (convenient.js file) a test is performed and if my TTL is smaller than 3600 it's set to 3600, i can change this behavior by editing the min value in the source file, but i'd like to make the patch in my application side (so anyone can npm install dnsd fresh and doesnt need to edit it's source file, i also dont want to fork dnsd project just
