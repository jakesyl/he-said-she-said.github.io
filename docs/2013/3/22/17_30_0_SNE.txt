Hi all, I'm new to node.js (with lots of background of DB's, PHP & Javascript) and I need to create a chat application which allow people to connect through FB and be at many chat rooms at once, I saw Passport and thought that maybe I should use that, then I read that it need to be used in Express framework... my question is, if I create an app which doesnt serve any real web pages (only server json responses to ajax from other sites), should I work with Passor
