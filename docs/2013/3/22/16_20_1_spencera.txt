ebright: a call to async creates a set of functions that are scheduled using process.nextTick all at the same time, they will then be called by Node's event loop, which will execute them in some unknown order. When each of the iterations is complete it calls back to async and says "I'm done", then async counts up those messages and lets you know when it get the last one, or an error.
