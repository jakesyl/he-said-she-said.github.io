I think the problem is at this bit of code.. http://i.imagebanana.com/img/m0rbokwj/Selection_039.png . This is what node-inspector shows about the arr variable: http://i.imagebanana.com/img/8i98facb/Selection_040.png .  Could someone tell me why !arr.length returns true, hence making the code return to the callback? Am I exporting the data correctly from usersdb.js?
