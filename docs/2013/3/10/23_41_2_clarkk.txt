faceleg I find that US TV shows eclipse a lot of movies these days, because the scale can be much greater due to the time they have to develop the plot and characters, and the budgets can be extremely large too. The Wire, The Shield, Farscape, Battlestar Galactica, Lonesome Dove. All more "classic"/must-see than a lot of movies in recent years
