would someone mind looking at this for me, please? I have successfully populated a mongo db, via mongoose and the browser. I'd like to refresh the data in the database using a fixtures file. For this I am using mongoose-fixtures at https://github.com/powmedia/mongoose-fixtures . The problem is that nothing is loaded. This is my code. https://gist.github.com/hal-gh/c6b26584afbcc039d8d0  Can anyone see the problem, please?
