would someone mind telling me why arr.length is undefined in the following code (from https://github.com/powmedia/mongoose-fixtures)?  http://i.imagebanana.com/img/m0rbokwj/Selection_039.png . See the node-inspector graphic showing length=7 here:  http://i.imagebanana.com/img/8i98facb/Selection_040.png .    Am I exporting the data correctly from usersdb.js in this code?  https://gist.github.com/hal-gh/c6b26584afbcc039d8d0
