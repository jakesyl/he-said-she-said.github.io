well, it's a storage, so i can share sockets there.. i have an aditional node process that talks to these 6x bg process and tells them what to do.. than each would pick in it's associated sockets, and .. do what it should .. i'm still thinking this in paper. i have the node app running as single fork/core now, must choose how to split it for better ressource handling :/
