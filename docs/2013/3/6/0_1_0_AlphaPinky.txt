the linux I have access is a server and it runs 24/7 non-stop which might be interesting to have things available all the time. my win8 notebook is only for development. my plan is to keep using the notebook but keep node running in a linux box. how I am going to make changes to the code that is remote is what IÂ´m trying to figure out.
