hey folks. i'm using fluent-ffmpeg to convert a http audio stream into another format (mp3=>ogg). i use request to get the input stream and pipe the whole thing to a http response object. Now, when the browser closes the connection (for example if you close the tab) the node process crashes becaus fluent-ffmpeg calls fd.close on my inputstream which is a network socket, not a fs stream. Now the question: how 2 fix?
