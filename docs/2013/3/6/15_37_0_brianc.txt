so here's my question: I have an event emitter that emits either 'connect' or 'error'.  I want to handle either 'connect' or 'error' once in total.  Meaning if 'error' fires, unsubscribe me from the 'connect' event and if 'connect' fires unsubscribe me from the 'error' event.  Is there already a module that will do this?
