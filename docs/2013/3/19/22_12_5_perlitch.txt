yea good point. atm im trying to implement an interface for this function to be something like: var precomp = require('precomp'); var template = precomp.hbs('./tpl_path.html'); the first problem im running into is inside of precomp.hbsâ€¦ how can i resolve the filename passed to the full path? im probably not understanding something
