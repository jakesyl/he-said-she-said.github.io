just writing a helper script so i can type 'command someshortalias' and itll auto execute the command with more args (host/port/pass) and optionally execute on multiple servers, so i filter the output to print what server its printing from, but for interactive mode... doesnt really need the server printer since can only do 1 at a time anyways
