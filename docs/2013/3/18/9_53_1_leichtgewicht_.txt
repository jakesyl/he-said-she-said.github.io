To follow up on my former question for the log: I tested now node-expat, xml2js, elementtree, node-xml, node-o3-xml, libxmljs, libxmljs-easy, dom-js and xmldom and I ended up using xmldom because even though its the least comfortable to work with I was able to read a file and write a file without a loss of formatting.
