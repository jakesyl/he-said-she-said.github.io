hi -- I'm trying to fix some ev_ref/eio_custom/ev_unref deprecation errors in a node.js module that contains native C++ bindings -- i've managed to figure out the uv_ref / uv_unref / uv_queue_work / uv_work_t pieces, but this module also directly refers to req->errorno and req->result. Does anyone know what the uv_work_t equivalent would be?
