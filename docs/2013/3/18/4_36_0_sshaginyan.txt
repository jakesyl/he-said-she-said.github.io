owen1: I have code where I'm trying to pass an object through using dependency injection . So after I do require(file)(obj); and module.exports = function(obj) { obj.x = function() {} }. I add a function to obj now when I do a console.log in the file where I did my require I get nothing. However, if I do obj.x = "Something" or obj.x = {} I can see the string and object was clearly made.
