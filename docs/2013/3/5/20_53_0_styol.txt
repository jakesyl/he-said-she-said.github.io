Would anyone recommend monit over forever or any other approach for keeping node instances running? In particular curious about that aspect combined with running the instances after a server is (re)booted. Utilizing ubuntu and seeing a lot of things recommending upstart/init.d + monit. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.
