AlphaPinky: I think it really depends on your situation. A lot of people will tell you to avoid Windows for development, but you find a lot of psychological bias when it comes to using an OS. If you can easily switch, then do it but if your company all runs Windows or you rely on Windows-only tools then it's probably not the right move
