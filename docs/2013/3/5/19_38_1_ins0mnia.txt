hey guys, need some help with express routes: given two routes /profile and /profile/:id and given app.get('/profile/:id',..) how can I get express to "trigger" the "/profile" cb first, followed by "/profile/:id"? (I'm rendering the templates dynamically and the intention is to inject the output of /profile/:id into /profile and req.send() the merged html)
