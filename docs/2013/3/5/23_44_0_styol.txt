Hola. I've got a max number / ceiling and need to perform a series of asynchronous functions on each number, some passing from async function 1 to async function 2 based on a truthy scenario and I ultimately need to create an object of other objects from the results. It seems that async.whilst is the correct call or amiwrong?
