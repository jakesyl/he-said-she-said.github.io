Just picked up Node so this may have an obvious answer. I am trying to do a simply proxy that will function just like http://anonymouse.org/anonwww.html, basically takes a url and then retrieves the site. here is what I have, http://hastebin.com/tedequfipo.coffee, the problem is images do not seem to come through along with follow up get requests... what is the proper way of doing this?
