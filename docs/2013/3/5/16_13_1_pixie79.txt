hi all - i am trying to write the output of a spawn stdout to a file, to do this i call a write_file function. The data is getting to the function because if i do console.log(data) i can see it but for some reason it is no longer going into the file, instead i get a '0' byte file created - any ideas ? https://gist.github.com/pixie79/5091404
