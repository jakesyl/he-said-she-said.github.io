morning all - i am having a callback issue - I am running a process via exec, if that process issues an error then my callback works ok however if it is ok or my file test before fails i can not seem to set the callback to anything that the script calling it seems to be happy with. I keep getting the error 'TypeError: undefined is not a function' any ideas ?
