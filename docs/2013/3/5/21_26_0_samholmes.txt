If I were to use DNode across multiple scripts, I would need to modularize a script that makes the DNode connection, and then use that module in other scripts. But how would I know when the connection is ready? I would need those other scripts to listen to an event when there is connection. But then what if the connection is lost?.. There's a lot involved in this.
