argh.  isn't there an elegant way to tie together sockets and http sessions?   using sockjs, express, redis (as my backend to keep state/sessions).   I have a dumb way where I send the session ID (from the express cookie) back across the socket, and use that, but it seemsâ€¦ insecure and/or inelegant.  There has to be a smarter way.
