What does it suggest when setting process.setMaxListeners(0); appears to prevent the leaking of memory? I'm utilizing memwatch and it is throwing notices about potential memory leaks with and without that setting being altered, but while viewing `free -m` it seems like memory is no longer being leaked (with MaxListeners set to 0)
