best practice: got my C/++ extension thing going, but in order to support EventEmitter pattern and other things, it will be wrapped.  Better form/more the normal to: make FunkyCore the extension, and Funky is the exported JS class, which wraps/passes through many funcs, and offers additional functionality where needed, OR just modify the prototypes during load up time, and avoid the pass through funcs?
