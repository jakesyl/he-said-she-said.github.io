bnoordhuis: no problem, entirely understandable. I'll keep digging. Could it be that pretty much all the utility functions are indeed defined in a global scope in the main app.js? I'm guessing, but I think I might need to change the general design pattern to make use of creating new instances, prototypes, something other than just a gaggle of functions defined by object keys that potentially depend on eachother
