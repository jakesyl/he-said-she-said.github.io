bnoordhuis: gotcha, was just curious if the foo example is what you meant I should try. Or maybe its core.utility that needs to be wrapped in anonymous function? var core = {}; core.utility = (function(){})(); module.exports = core; -- var core = require('./core.js'); var foo = function() { core.utility(â€¦); }; -- sorry, I'm a bit new and just a tad confused ;)
