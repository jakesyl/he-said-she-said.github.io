One of the things I think is great about npm is the anarchy bit - anybody can add, etc.  I think the key is really a way to verify what you are pulling down is valid / trusted.  I think making that external to the main npm system would allow for multiple mechanisms to be implemented / changed out over time.  including allowing folks with large deployments to specify their own with their own rules.
