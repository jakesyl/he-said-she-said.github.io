Hi, It may not be the place to ask a general programming question, but still...I want to chain some unit tests (all http req/res) so that the response of the 1st becomes part of the request of the next. Problem is that the info should not be public (like a registration hash). So, setting the private info in the response of the 1st is ok for testing purposes, but not in our live code. So the whole purpose of the unit test is a bit lost here.
