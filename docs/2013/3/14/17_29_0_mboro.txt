hi guys! I'm building a web app using Backbone/HTML5 pushState and node.js. node.js serves the same routes as Backbone. any way to centralize the document.title between the two so that when I visit /about, node.js sets the doc title to "About" and when I visit /about using Backbone navigate, it sets the doc title to "About" as well?
