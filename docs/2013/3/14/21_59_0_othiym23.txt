isaacs: there's a whole other discussion I'd like to have about how to use domains to propagate transactional context across a continuation chain, but it's a lot more complicated than this and I want to get a new beta with a potentially broken transaction tracer (because it's already busted) but a working error tracer for node 0.10 ASAP
