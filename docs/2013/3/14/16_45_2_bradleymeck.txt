TheEwok: cause people get upset that something is a unit test or integration test and not a unit test or integration test and argue it should be a unit test or integration test instead. when really they just want it to be a different *test* and none of that matters (had someone complaining that node had NO tests since they were all integration and not unit in their eyes)
