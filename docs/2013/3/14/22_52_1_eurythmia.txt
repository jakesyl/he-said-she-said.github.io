Hi folks; I'm running ubuntu 12.10 and I installed both nodejs and nodejs-legacy (legacy provides the node binary, nodejs provides the nodejs binary); I've also installed npm and ran "npm install fs". I jave a "server.js" file provided to me, but it appears to not have (the correct?) fs module. A brief run/explanation is pasted here (http://www.pastebin.ca/2332493); I'd appreciate any help to get me up and running.
