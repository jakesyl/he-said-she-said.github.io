I dont wan't to be a bother, but would anyone have a clue why the simple http.createServer(stuff).listen(port) method stop working for me only after updating to 0.10.0? I've looked online and haven't seen anyone with the issue. It even works in 0.9.22 which is the last beta in my version control list.
