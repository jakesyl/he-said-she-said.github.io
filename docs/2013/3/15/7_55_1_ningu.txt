no, the idea is, say I have a set of 30 records I want the client to display. I can send the client an html template which incorporates the logic for how to render that data. that buys me the model binding logic in angular, knockout or whatever. but how do I actually get the data to the client, assuming I want to optimize the number of requests and not make the client initiate a second request before the page can even render?
