Hey all, I'm executing node from the command like as so: `node --harmony_collections -e "require('$DIR/../lib/command');" $*`, and if I pass in arguments to this script, if they start with a -, node tries to execute it as an option, I've seen other programs use something like "app file.ext -- --my-options-here", does node have anything like that so that options are passed into the process.argv?
