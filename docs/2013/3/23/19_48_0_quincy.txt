anyone help with a socket.io question (likely general JS question)? inside a class i begin listening via socket.on('foo',bar);  the function bar() tries to use a callback method this.baz().  but baz() is undefined (despite my defining it).  when i debug to see what "this" is, it's SocketNamespace, not the class i thought.
