greetings there yall, are there any libs available yet for generating html & css? In keeping with the "all in one language paradigm". i am looking to generate the actuall html and css in jss to. this is a personal project. so if i could write divs and set styles in jss, that would be cool fun! i know that it wouldn't be ultra efficient, but just an interesting thought for me. is there anything like this floating around yet?
