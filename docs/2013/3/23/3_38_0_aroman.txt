so i've been reading up on the streams2 api, and I'm trying to port my code to the new API -- not simply triggering "old mode"/streams1 backwards compatibility mode. My question is, what is the proper way to only be notified when a stream ends, while not caring about the data? In other words, I have no interest in actually reading the streamâ€¦ I just want to know when it's finished. How should I indicate this in the streams2 api? readable.read(), with
