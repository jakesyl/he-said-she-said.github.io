I would like to add a configuration file that tells my app what path/to/app and subdomain to use in my code. My code is var express.vhost('subdomain.domain.com', require('path/to/my/app').  for instance: { 'path/to/my/app', 'subdomain.domain.com' }. I noticed in package.json there is a "domains" section however it doesn't provide the 'path/to/my' app ability. I was thinking about making my own file 'routes.json' for this. Has anyon
