A small/minimal example can be found at http://pastie.org/6465381. I'm finding when running this that no matter the limit of i, I get all outside items logged, before a single inside item is logged.  In Qt, unless you did something to keep the application loop open somehow, the equivalent of that snippet would return almost instantly ( granted, having a majority of the items never execute ).
