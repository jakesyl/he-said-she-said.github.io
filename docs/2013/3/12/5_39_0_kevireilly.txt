zeromodulus: picture it like this.. the client makes a request to the server, and the server does not respond until it actually has something to respond. This being the case, it replicates live behavior because the client is always waiting for a response. HTTP requests need to eventually time out, so the client eventually cancels its request and starts the cycle over again
