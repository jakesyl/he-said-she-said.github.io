In long-polling, the server does not respond to the clients request unless it actually has something to respond. This replicates live behavior because the client is always perpetually waiting for a response. If it doesn't get one in 30 seconds i think the timeout is, it starts the cycle over again just to prevent a normal HTTP request timeout
