are there any standard patterns for error handling in event driven frameworks like node?  (mildly over passing error objects all the way down a chain / aggregating errors / etc, in most cases I'd be happy with just passing it back to the client (eg: server error: access denied) or terminating the request out-right w/ an error logged depending on the error type, instead of handling each one individually)
