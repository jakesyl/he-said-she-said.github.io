anyone used sockjs, then? I am just copy-pasting code from the respective READMEs (sockjs-client and sockjs-node), but I get a client-side error: "http://127.0.0.1:9999/localhost/echo/info" -- localhost is being appended to the base URL, for some reason. It does not appear in the source. What can I do?
