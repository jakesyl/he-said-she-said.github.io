Question: (im using socket.io) I want to set a variable on another socket from within the connect function of another socket. like io.sockets.socket(OTHER_SOCKET_ID).MyVar = X; - How would I do this?  (Using the get/set methods of socket.io will not work for me in this case since they are async and I need to set the variable of the other socket instantly)  I know the socketID of the socket I want to set the variable on.
