Hi, I have the following scenario: 1. Client sends request via socket.io -> 2. Some processing occurs on server, may take a minute or more, is blocking -> 3. Server sends result via socket.io  - what would you recommend for managing the heavy processing? Should I be looking at node-webworker, forever, or something different?
