morning all... I have a question regarding the 0.10 release. I've created user accounts using crypto.pbkdf2 to encrypt passwords on node 0.8, and when I run my app on 0.10 (no code changes) the encryption results differ, so you can't log into any accounts... I'm new to node so I haven't got a clue where to go from here.
