bradleymeck: I see a ports.on('disconnect') However I'm not sure what to do at this point. Say that happens when I kill the process running the seaport server; I just call register again? Does that mean I need to restart all the nodes when this happens, because the connections between the nodes are no longer valid if they all want/have new ports and need to restart. This would be a cascading problem.
