I'm trying to figure out how to have sub modules access an object in my main moduleâ€¦ the issue is that I have three levels of requires app.js > routes.js > controllers/a.js, b.js, c.js > models/a.js, b.js, c.js (wanted to define my db connect in app.js) instead of having to include it in every one of my models. Is there a best practice for this?
