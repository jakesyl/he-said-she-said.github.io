swaj: I'm getting constricted into youtube videos of service oriented architecture and what I'm really trying to do is lay the groundworks for a playform so I can easily manage and spawn nodejs servers in environments (live, acc, test, dev). Chopping everything up into their own logic(al) parts seemed like a good idea.
