What I'd like to do is take a big chunk of independent logic and move it to a (new) service, so I can talk to it from app/website servers instead of each including one. Say I have one service for static files, one for authentication, cache, accounts, sessions etc. Is this a good/bad idea? I'm not sure how to think about scaling, and for now it is just going to all run on one server anyway, but it has 8 cores
