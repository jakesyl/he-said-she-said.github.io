Hi, I'm trying to start with Node.js and websockets, but i have a problem. I've created "websocket-node" server ( http://pastie.org/private/qdmublgxxcyrwzno06ata ), but it wont work, cause of:Sec-WebSocket-Accept header from server didn't match expected value of. I would be gratefull if you tell me what could be wrong.
