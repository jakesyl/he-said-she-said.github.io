@tjholowaychuk I'm trying to have views evaluate paths relative to a file that instantiates the view rather than the base file. Right now I'm working on the node side but ultimately I'll extend component to use jade-runtime and have the views render the right thing (either full out jade reading the full path or just a helper function + jade runtime packaged with component client side)
