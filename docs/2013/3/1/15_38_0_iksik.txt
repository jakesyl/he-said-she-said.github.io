is it possible to catch all events in eventEmitter2 using wildcard and for all delimited sections at once? for example, when i emit ee.emit('foo.bar.baz'); and i want to catch it with ee.on('*'); but i can't, i need to use ee.on('*.*.*'); but then it can't handle events fired with: ee.emit('foo') ;-S
