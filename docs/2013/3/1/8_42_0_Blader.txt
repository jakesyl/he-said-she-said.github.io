i have a projet with the following architecture : project/client/(allHtmlFiles)  and    project/server/app.js  .. so i use the client folder as static folder with : app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/../client'));  and i map the url with : app.get('/', function(err, req, res, next){     res.sendfile('/index.html'); }); it's work ! but if i had the same line to map the url /test and send the file test.hmt it doesn't :'(
