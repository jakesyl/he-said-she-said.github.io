So, I think I´m in a proper place to ask my question. I´m forcing a "blocking code" on nodejs calling "exec" from child_process library. My question is.. during my call for example child = exec("node myfile.js ",callbackFunction)  is possible to call only a specific function from the file "myfile.js" ? I mean.. call junst a function called x() inside the muFile.js instead run entire file.
