there will still be templating and logic, but it will be separate from the main html itself. this is to keep the original html clean so it can be modified by designers and not break the template logic as easily. and the designers dont have to worry about the code/logic. it's a separation of concerns. so I will still have context but it will be in the controller/presenter rather than in the html itself.
