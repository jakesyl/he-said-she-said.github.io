Evenin' folks, I am curious is there some way to achieve this: I have a project which references some of the libraries that are found in NPM like underscore via require('')  and when I build that project for deploying in web I want to somehow add that file in some appropriate dir, (at the moment doing that via copy task and underscore submodule) curious if there are some better ways as I am new to this thing
