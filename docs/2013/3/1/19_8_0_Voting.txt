My server (node) and my client (chrom) will need to make requests via JSON-RPC. I have no experience with this. Should I be using specific libraries? Can folks point me a web pages I should read? My new employer  uses JSON-RPC as the transport for nearly everything and they get really deep with this stuff. Ideas?
