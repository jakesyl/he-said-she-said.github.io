Say I have an object, which kind of extends a normal socket, it has events, timeouts and other such stuff. Should I be cleaning all this up when I want to destroy it, can I just delete it or set it to null. I'm having some bizarre problems which looks like the socket may be still alive even though the object has been deleted/nulled
