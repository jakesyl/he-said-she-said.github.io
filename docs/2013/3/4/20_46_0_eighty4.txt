deoxxa: read a bit about debugging coffee and it seem as you need to first find what's wrong with the "compiled" js code, given it's not code you've written it might be hard. Then try to figure out how to fix it in coffee. I.e. a couple of more layers of complexity. But I've always wanted to learn coffee :/
