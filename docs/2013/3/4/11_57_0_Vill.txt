Hello folks, Could you please answer my question: when using JADE templating engine why contents of <HEAD> tag are being rendered inside my <BODY> tag, while leaving <head></head> empty? and why "!!!" declaration at the top is being appended to <BODY> tag as well? I'm so surprised because 3 days ago, everything worked fine =S
