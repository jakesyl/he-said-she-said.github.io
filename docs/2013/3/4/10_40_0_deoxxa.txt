grahamsavage: i've built a system at work on node, over the course of about 2 years now. my experience so far has been great. node as a piece of software has been rock-solid, and the backwards compatibility on stable releases has been great. there are libraries for a lot of the common things you'd think of, and a lot of uncommon things as well.
