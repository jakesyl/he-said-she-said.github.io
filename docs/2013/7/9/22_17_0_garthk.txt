ForSpareParts: depends what you're doing. The V8 engine's optimiser works best when you have lots of small functions on yourobject.prototype accessing shared state via 'this'. It might feel more JavaScript-ey to have functions closing around functions closing around functions closing around functions, but it tends to defeat V8's optimiser and thrash the garbage collector.
