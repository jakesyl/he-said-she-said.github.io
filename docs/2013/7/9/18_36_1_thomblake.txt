tandoori: If you do want to execute php scripts with also a node server, there are a few ways to do it, but I don't think there's a standard.  You can also run Apache and have something like Nginx route to Node or Apache, or you can exec the php script from node  through the shell interface and return the result.  But probably you should just write all your back-end stuff in JS.
