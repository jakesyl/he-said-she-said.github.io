I'm working on an IRC client thing, and I'm trying to wrap my head around the options for realtime apps. I was considering something like meteor, perhaps with a frontend framework like angular or backbone, but the database assumption seems like it's baked into everything, and my app will have pretty substantial non-db data. Am I better off picking up socket.io and trying to roll something myself...?
