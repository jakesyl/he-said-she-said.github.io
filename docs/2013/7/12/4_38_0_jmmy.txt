LoneSoldier728, cool me too. I am just starting tonight.  Its been years, off and on as hobby I've been trying to learn php.  I've struggle, but I think I grasped it pretty good, and can make some server stuff now, but I am skipping applying my skills and going through the troubleshooting hell and jumping into node now
