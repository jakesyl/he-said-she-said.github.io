I got a nodejs project , having logical issue with git. I have started to try and version control my crap with git. I did the following. I started coding on my local before installing git. I installed got after I had a working copy of my code. I ran the following commands in order. 1> "git init" to state that the local folders are my code base. 2> git add --all to add all the folders and files
