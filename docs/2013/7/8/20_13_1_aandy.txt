i'm also thinking i should differentiate by metric, as a simple loadbalancer (only) balances cpu/response time/number of open connections. what about bandwith? e.g. you need to serve 200mbit, but your load balancer is bound to 100mbit - how do you tie that together in a "single domain" setup. that sort of thing. not looking for quick answer, more what to search for as i'm not sure what half the terms used are :)
