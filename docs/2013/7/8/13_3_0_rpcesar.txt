ok, after fiddling around for hours getting a profiler going for node in the 0.10 branch, im now struggling to understand the dang thing. I am trying to analyze a heap snapshot to try to indicate whats consuming so much memory. I understand the concept of weak references and shallow, but I don't understand the unit of measurement being used by the "node-webkit-profiler" (which I presume is the same as would be on chrome given its UI)
