so i've been having performance issues with my C++ extension; presumably it's touching v8 too much and the cost for calling into/out from C is too high; i was thinking about actually establishing a pipe of some sort, where the extension would "listen" for invocations and "send" response data, and the rest of the code would be in pure javascript
