hi, I have a question about Streams2 in objectMode: when I take substack's code from https://github.com/substack/stream-handbook#creating-a-readable-stream to create a Readable Stream and try to use it to create an objectMode Readable Stream by pushing { key: String.fromCharcodeAt(c++) } instead of just String.fromCharcodeAt(c++), in stdout I only get { key: a } and then it stops instead of getting the whole alphabet. Why is that?
