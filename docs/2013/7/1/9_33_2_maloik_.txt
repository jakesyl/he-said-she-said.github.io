I'm running Hubot and I'm just wondering if there is some kind of order to all the plugins (and specifically the regexp's they match against). For instance if I have a plugin that matches /(foo).*/ and one /(foo)(bar).*/ will it automatically select the best one if both match? or will it run both, or... ?
