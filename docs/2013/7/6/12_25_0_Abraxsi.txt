n2liquid lol.. i'm trying to accustom myself to the 'real world'. I've been programming html, css, javascript, jquery, through to java spring mysql backend for 5 years. but i've never really found a place in chatrooms and found it difficult to know which technology trends to follow. finally feel with node community I have a chance to get to grips with the 'bigger' picture. So please excuse anything I say that might seem crazy.
