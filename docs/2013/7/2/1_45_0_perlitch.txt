ok i think i understand what you are saying, but help me a littleâ€¦ wouldnt that mean you'd have to add to your application code just to provide for testing (not necessarily a horrible thing) and also does that really cover all use-cases for mocking? not everything i want to mock is going to be an http request. then again maybe since i am just now starting testing i dont quite realize that it isnt really an issue to not mock all deps
