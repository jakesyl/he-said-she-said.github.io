hello. in one of my routes i am redirecting to a url path. on my local machine i obviously use localhost:8888 etc, but when I deploy that obviously won't work. I think I need to configure this var based on my environment but I am a node newbie and can't seem to find these documented anywhere, any help would be really aprpecaited!
