I am trying to connect to my openfire xmpp server using the node-xmpp server, but I am getting XMPP Authentication Failure. The failure is resulting from a failure stanza for an xmpp-sasl connection. I am not experienced with openfire or XMPP. Why is my authentication failing? Do I need to change my openfire sasl settings somehow?
