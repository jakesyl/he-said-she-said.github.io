i am using JSON.stringify() on an html template, and finding that i need to escape the resulting string with some `.replace()`s described here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/9204218/741970 (i.e. `.replace(/[\"]/g, '\\\"')`). is there a facility built into node for this? i feel like there must be something?
