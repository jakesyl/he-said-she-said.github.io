bewest: my use-case is I have a TCP stream that pipes to other things AND other things pipe to IT. I have a situation where my TCP stream may need to "reset" itself so that it is NOT piping to anything and NOTHING is piping to it ... but this is NOT a .end() because the TCP connection may re-enter the system given some future conditions
