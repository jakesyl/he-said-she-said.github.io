I'm having some issues with the stdin stream... I'm using the terminal-menu module, and am trying to get it to relinquish control over stdin and stdout so I can do other things with them, which seems to work correctly, but for some reason an error event on stdin is being generated for "Error: read EIO". Anyone have a clue what this means?
