The code I maintain handles much of the SMS traffic to/from the internet, and I'm having an issue with one of our SMPP carrier binds. They implement a sort of throttling which is a bit funky. What they do is instead of simply *not* accepting messages, they send responses to our delivery attempts saying we're being throttled.
