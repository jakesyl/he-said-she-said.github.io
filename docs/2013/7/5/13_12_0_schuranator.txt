I'm using an expresstrain angular seed and did some changing around my goal is to get angular on my phone using phone gap and login and authenticate the user. So I have passport.js and was able to login and pass the user back to the phone. But when I use req.isAuthenticated or req.session it seems like the phone isn't storing the session I was wondering if there might be a good example or something to look at
