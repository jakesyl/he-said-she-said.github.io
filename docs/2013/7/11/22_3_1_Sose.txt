I've made a simple canvas game prototype in coffeescript.. now for practice purposes, I'm trying to add some socket.io online capabilities with node backend. I'm trying to use node+express+socket.io. do I need to add handlers for every JS file I try to use on the client? now I get errors like "NetworkError: 404 Not Found - http://localhost:8080/jquery-2.0.2.js"
