Can someone offer some streams advice?  Im piping a live video stream to file so I can then set up a read stream that pipes the video feed elsewhere.  Its for psuedo live streaming so I don't need to save the feed.  How do I regulate the size of the file generated by the write stream and keep it overwriting itself as opposed to getting infinitely larger?
