hey guys, I'm looking to do some custom authentication. I've looked at a couple frameworks (passport, everyauth) and they seem great if you want to use an existing strategy, but undocumented if you want to create your own. can anyone recommend a good, easily-extensible auth framework (preferably with express middleware)?
