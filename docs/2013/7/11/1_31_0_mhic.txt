Hi, I know this is not the right place, however, can't find any info anywhere.  HHave Mongo db version v2.0.4, pdfile version 4.5, Node.js v0.10.13, and db version v2.0.4, pdfile version 4.5 installed in Linux Mint 13 Maya Ubuntu Precise 32bit.  When i try to compile a sample program in Opa with "opa hello.opa --" it compiles, but I can't access anything with localhost:8080.  Any ideas...
