juho: there's a fine line between people who geniunely have interest but trouble understanding the principles or even use-cases of node (like my father who is an embedded C veteran) and people who troll the node.js community for the lulz by playing stupid. hard to tell for me which is which. sometimes i even think my father is just trolling me.
