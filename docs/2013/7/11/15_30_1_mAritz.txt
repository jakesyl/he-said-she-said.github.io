merpnderp: memory management isn't easy. I'm having some issues myself where i have a frontend canvas app that has a sawtooth memory profile even though i'm preeetty sure i'm not allocating anything. so i did a bunch of minimizing my code to find what's going on and i have not had much success... :/
