i only once read pci 1.x completely and was tasked to evaluate whether the company i worked for complied. i got to like page 5 before i knew they didn't. and after reading the entire thing i went into the code just for fun to see if i could find security holes that wouldn't cause a pci inspector to kill someone... i did. plenty.
