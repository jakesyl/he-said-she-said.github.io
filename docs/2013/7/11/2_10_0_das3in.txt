Hi everyone! I have a pretty basic / newbie question.  I'm using Mongoose/Express for my backend.  Instead of setting up my Mongoose Schema in the same file as my api, I'd like to split them up into a /Models folder and a /api folder. How can i include the models in the api.js file and how can I initialize both in the server.js file?
