jdelgado, im sorry if this question was stupid. i would like to sell something online. server is nodejs. and the payment would have to be reported to the server. i thought maybe there would be modules for both server and client side. like a paypal module that generates some html for the client and sets up its own port for encrypted feedback on the payment success
