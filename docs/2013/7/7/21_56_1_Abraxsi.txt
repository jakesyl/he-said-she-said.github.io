i remember trying to write an interpolation algo ages ago that took into account the co-ordinates received, and tried to guess where they'd be currently, and sort of interpolate between the current position, the actual last known co-ordinate and the prediction of where theoretically where they should be based on speed etc. I eventually gave up.
