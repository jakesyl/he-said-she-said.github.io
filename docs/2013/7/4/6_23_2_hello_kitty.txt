so i have match making server, and it follows this basic process: a player plays a puzzle game and then submits their score when they finish the game. The player's identity and score and then stored in a list caleld 'waitingForOpponent.' Any subsequent players that submit scores are either "matched" or added to the waitingForOpponent.
