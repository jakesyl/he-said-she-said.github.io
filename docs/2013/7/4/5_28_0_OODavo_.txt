Is there an intended standard format for progress notifications from promises, like Q supports? I've written a module that's manipulating promises with progress, and it currently assumes that promises will notify of progress using a float between 0 and 1 (i.e., 0.5 is half-done). Is this at all standardised? Is there some other convention I should be using instead?
