fkm: I'm pretty sure ? can be replaced only with a literal (or you can use ?? for identifiers). Probably what you want is to use escape and/or escapeId (and you'll need to handle NOW() yourself). I have not tried any complicated queries in node-mysql, though, so that's just based on my raeding of the documentation.
