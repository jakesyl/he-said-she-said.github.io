daslicht: My understanding is that Javascript engines won't bother garbage collecting until there's enough to warrant a collection. No point in sending the garbage trucks round each time a person puts out a rubbish bag. To ensure that objects no longer required are eligible for collection you need to follow good programming practices. Investigate closures, and memory leaks on google.
