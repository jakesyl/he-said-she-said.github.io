i'm making a mobile game which posts json from iphones/ipads to a node server. So far every message contains a playerId alongside whatever other data needs saved. I'd like to introduce a little bit of security -- any suggestions? So far all I've thought of is to generate a key at login and periodically refresh it a sorta crude copy of browser sessions.
