aandy, the promises implementation handles errors automatically. Basically, a Promise is an `Either<Error, X>` type where you can apply transformations to either side, and the side with no transformation just propagates to the next transformation. So `error.onSuccess(doX)` will just return `error` unchanged. All the error handling in this particular script is in: `res.otherwise(raise)`, which throws the error if any occurred.
