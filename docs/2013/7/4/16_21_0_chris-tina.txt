aandy, basically, the main advantage of promises is that you can compose asynchronous operations just as easily as you'd compose synchronous one. So you can write things like: `write('foo', read('bar'))`. Semi-coroutines (Co) will give you something like that too, but then you'd write it as: `function* (){ yield write('foo', yield read('bar')) }`.
