well having windows side by side might solve some easy level where it's not that mucha problem to click sequentially instead of simultaneously. so let's move a level up. i have some instances of the garden game running, each its own window. each has a rake that i'd like to drag over a field. so is there any way on windows 7 or 8 to drag (mouse down, move 2px/wait, move 2px/wait, ..., up) simultaneously in multiple windows?
