slicky: the idea is to make JavaScript as pain-free as possible, by doing things like having early typechecking (e.g. "asdf" + x() will error since "asdf" isn't a Number) and providing nice helpers for the developer, such as the async stuff, which would otherwise require a library or inversion of code.
