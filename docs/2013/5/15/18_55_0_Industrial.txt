What's the simplest possible proxy in nodejs? I'm not sure how the process works. Say I have 2 http.Server's, A running on port 80 and B on 9001. What will happen when I want to proxy some HTTP traffic landing on A by hostname to B (or C, D, ..)?    1) do I pipe the request to that port?    2) will it answer with a response object?   3) do I end the response in B or in A?
