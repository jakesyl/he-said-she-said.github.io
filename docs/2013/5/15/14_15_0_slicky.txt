Ever since ruby, people try and turn everything into "least typed" languages. Why? I mean each piece of that code is important, and any new user migrating to these kind of "safety" languages seems to be trying to skirt the real understanding of what, where and why in the actual language. Maybe I'm way off base, but it feels that way to me.
