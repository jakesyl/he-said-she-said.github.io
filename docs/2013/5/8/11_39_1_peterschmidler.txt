When I load a hash from mongodb in production (Ubuntu) it gets somehow destroyed like $���gG9�+��… instead of vEKLQ0lr6iwEa4… event though it looks correct when I look at the mongoDB via the console. Locally (OSX) everything's fine. What could that be? Is there a way to set the encoding inside the node.js app. I am using mongojs.
