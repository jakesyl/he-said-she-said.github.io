Benchmarking object streams: trivial stream.Readable pipes to trivial stream.Writable at 570K/sec; drops to 84K/sec when piped through stream.PassThrough or a trivial stream.Transform; keeps dropping to 21K/sec at five transforms. So, using object streams as I'd use LINQ is a bit like punching myself in the head: I should just cut that shit out unless I like pain.
