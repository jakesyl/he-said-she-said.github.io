hi guys. how does one go about delivering a node.js script/package that has an install action, ie it installs an initscript in /etc/init.d and then it can be run. I'm actually thinking of deb packages, is there an example of a node script/app that is delivered as a deb package? Or maybe some more general way of installing the script 'system-wide' so to speak
