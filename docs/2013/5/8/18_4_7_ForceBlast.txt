Hi all.  Streams noob here.  Is there a way to close a stream before it reaches the end?  I'm using the "request" module and piping it through "sax" to parse an XML file.  The XML file is HUGE and I'd like to exit and terminate the stream once I have what I need from the XML file.  So I'm guessing I'd be telling request to close its stream once I get the nodes I need.  Any tips on how to pull this off?
