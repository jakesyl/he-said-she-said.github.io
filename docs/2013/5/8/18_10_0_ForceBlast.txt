I'm creating my stream like this:  var parser = request(options).pipe(sax.createStream());   I tried calling parser.end() but that threw an error.   I think this is because parser now holds a reference to the destination stream.  I'll try breaking it out into separate calls and see if that works.  Thanks for your help.
