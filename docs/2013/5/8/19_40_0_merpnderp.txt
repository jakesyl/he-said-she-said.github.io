AAA_awright: I just don't see how persistent auth cookies can be safe. If a user is currently connected to mysite.com but opens a tab to badsite.com, and badsite.com forges its domain header and does an <img src="http://mysite.com/login /> and then later does an <img src="http://mysite.com/do/something/evil" />, how you could keep that from happening.
