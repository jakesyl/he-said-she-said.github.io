oliveiraev: wait, no, I got ahead of myself with that response :/ delete doesn't solve my dillema and slice is probably too wasteful. I actually want to execute these statement(s) inside a function call parameter for brevity. Just today though I learned about how to wrap things with (,) ...so I can do someFunction((arr.shift(),arr))
