hello all. I am having a problem with compound.js. I know that may be a bit off-topic but the folk in irc://irc.freenode.org:6667/#compoundjsÂ said I should ask here. I get a "TypeError: Cannot call method 'validatesPresenceOf' of undefined" when I start my app. this in addition to a "Generator crud not found" error when using 'compound generate' from the command line.
