The big lesson is we have to stop thinking of tokens as a methanism to merely identify users and also use them to authorize actions. Not just to secure sessions, but maybe I want to request a token that let's a third party read my address book, that I can hand out, so they can perform actions on my behalf. It's not just more secure, it's more useful for the Web.
