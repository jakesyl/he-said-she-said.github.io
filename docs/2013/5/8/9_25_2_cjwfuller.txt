First time in the Node.js IRC.. in fact first time in any IRC!  I'm wondering if it's possible to make a Node proxy that listens for HTTP requests and either just lets the request happen normally OR alters the URL in some way e,g, redirects the user to some other URL.. so kind of like a router in a way
