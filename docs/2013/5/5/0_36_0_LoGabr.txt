Anyone familiar with express sessions: I am trying to pass information from redis to authenticate users connecting to via websockets. I have my cookie in the form of "s:fgkjsdfgkl...~140 characters...ssdfgsdfg" but it looks like redis has them in form of "sess:jsdfgkl...~20 characters...gfs". Is there middleware or a package on npmjs to go between these two forms?
