i need advice about exiting from a node process. I want to send `not ok` for npm tests, but if I do a process.exit(1) it gives back an Unknown signal: 1, and a whole backtrace. I would like to not have that, as the backtrace I am interested in is shown before that already (but that is just normal output to stdout, because it comes from somewhere else)
