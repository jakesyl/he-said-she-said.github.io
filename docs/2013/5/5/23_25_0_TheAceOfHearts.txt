so… I have a laser tag game. I have lobbies and stuff using socket.io. But I'm not sure how I should go about handling the actual game logic. Like, multiple games can be going on at once — either Timed Deathmatch or Deathmatch. The devices send me some data when they get hit, and I have to keep track of who's winning and such, any suggestions?
