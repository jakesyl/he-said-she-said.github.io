Hello from Bangkok, Thailand :)  I wanted to reach out to other devs for the latest in DB usage by node.js devs.  I started with mongodb, but now that i'm using it more, specifically with nested documents, I'm having second thoughts, then I read about data integrity issues...  I'm wondering if there is a newer DB that devs are using or if the goto is still mongodb
