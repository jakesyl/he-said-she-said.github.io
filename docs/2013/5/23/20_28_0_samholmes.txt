Using Stylus and Nib: I can use transform without vendor prefixes and the mixin will output the prefixes for me. But, what if I want to use one of these mixins in another property or mixin? For example, say I have transform: scale(.5); and then following that I have transition: transform 500ms; Would Stylus know how to give transition the appropriate arguments?
