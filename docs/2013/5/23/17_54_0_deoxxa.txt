shlevy: there's no docs or anything though, sorry. it takes buffers/strings as input and outputs objects that look like {type: "data", data: Buffer([...])} or {type: "sequence", char: ..., input: Buffer([...])}. you can then pipe its output through https://github.com/fknsrs/jetty (which does have docs) to turn it back into buffers
