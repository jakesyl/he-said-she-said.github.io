is it possible to get connect-restreamer to support both application/json and application/x-www-form-urlencoded? i'm using it to work around connect.bodyParser() middleware stealing req.body from http-proxy, but it seems to be doing a JSON.stringify on the body, when it should be doing querystring.stringify
