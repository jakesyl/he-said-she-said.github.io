mscdex: That's a thought one of my devs had, but how would I manage that between various projects such that there aren't conflicts? It almost seems like, on the staging machine (Using the premise that all devs aren't totally aware of what every other dev is doing), port number should be decided automatically somehow and routed accordingly?
