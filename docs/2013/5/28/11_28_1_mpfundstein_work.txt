I have some weird issues with Node 0.10 . I send json packages via my internal network to other node processes. When I sent multiple ones (10 - 30) they get sent in bursts. 4 packages a time, with up to 2 minutes between the batch. This is pretty annoying. On node 0.8 on Centos everything was fine. Now I am on 0.10 on mac
