Does anyone have experience with mysql plugins for node?  I was using "db-mysql" and it seems to no longer work with the more recent node.js. I tried "mysql" and it just seems to be pretty shoddy.  The mysql connection can close, and I tried adding my own reconnection based off what I've seen others do with it, and the reconnection doesn't seem to work and doesnt' throw an erorr.
