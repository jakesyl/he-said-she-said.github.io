bnoordhuis: so the difference between used and total doesn't go above 100MB, even when the RAM usage goes over a gig. but the heap snapshots I was able to get were a little bit smaller after the main work loop, so I'm not sure what the heck is going on. maybe whatever v8 does to count used heap isn't accurate and a heap snapshot gives you the right value?
