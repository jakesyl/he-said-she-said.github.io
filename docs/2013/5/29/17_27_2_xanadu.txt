@mbalho, bnoordhuis, Havvy: awesome. question about using Buffers and Streams - i receive a base64 image data POST and want to store it in S3 as binary like something.png. can a Buffer or Stream help me accomplish this without writing to a disk locally - in other words, just manipulate it, then proxy it up to S3?
