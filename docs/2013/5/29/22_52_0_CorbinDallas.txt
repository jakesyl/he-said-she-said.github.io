I've made a module that exports a function that I'm passing an empty object to (via foo.apply(this,[obj]) ) that was declared in the closure that is calling the module's function.  I can see the empty object in the module's function, but when I manipulate the object the object does not change in the original closure, in the original closure the object remains unaffected.  This seems like strange behavior to me.
