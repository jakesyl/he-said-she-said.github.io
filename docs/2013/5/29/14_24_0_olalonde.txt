for example , I have a module "controller" that  needs a mysql object, a smtp object, etc. etc. that all need to be initialized asynchronously. one way is to inject the initialized dependencies when i require the module require('controller')(mysql, smtp) … the other way is to initialize mysql/smtp and wait for them to be initialized before i require('controller')… that way controller can safely require mysql/smtp without having to initialize them
