hi, i've slowly (finally) started using mocha. before i dive in too deep in one framework, i'd like to ask if anyone know of alternatives to browser testings? zombie.js works horribly for me in 10.5 (known issues). phantom used to be "difficult to setup", but seems to be a lot easier these days. any prefs? (primarily browser tests)
