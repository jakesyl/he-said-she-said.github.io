ljharb: Well, fair enough. This project's turning into a bit of a mess (it's the first thing I've done in Node), but it's for school and sadly, I just don't have time to scrap what I've done so far. For what it's worth, I tried the named parameter syntax and got exactly the same results -- it's like they just aren't applying my parameters to the sql string at all.
