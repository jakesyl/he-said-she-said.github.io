dypsilon, since bodyParser from express is based on formidable everyone will use it, yes. My Problem is, that there is no real access to the progress-event with bodyParser only. Thats why I searched for another solution and i found formidable (i didnt realize that express uses this at this time). Formidable has a progressevent and easy access to it - why not bodyParser? What iam doing wrong?
