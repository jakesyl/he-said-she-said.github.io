Hy! I am working on some project and I need to include XML schemes and so on (DTD, XSLT i think). I have on statistics of some games played and I need them to save it to XML file (to download it). So i need to include (not sure really) DTD, XSLT and XML files somehow right? Can you help me please? What is the best and the easiest way to do this? So just save some data to XML file and download it. (within DTD and XSLT files maybe) Thanks
