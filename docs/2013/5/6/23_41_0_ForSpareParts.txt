I don't really know anything about practical use of NoSQL -- it's just not something I've learned yet. I imagine there are really good situations for it, or it wouldn't be so popular, but I don't know what that scenario looks like or how you play to it. I've gotten very used to the relational way of doing things since I've been seeing/using/making relational DB setups for a couple years now.
