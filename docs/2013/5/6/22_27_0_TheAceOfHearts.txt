so.. I'm using Sublime Text 2 with this plugin: https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter and I'm using socket.io, and it keeps complaining when I do things like:         io.sockets.in(room).emit('game:score', result); … because of the 'in' keyword, which is reserved. so… does anyone know a way around this?
