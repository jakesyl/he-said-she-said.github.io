I might be on the wrong channel, but I have a question. I'm experimenting with WebGL and would like to create a server for whatever I'm going to draw out inside the canvas. So basically a "chat-server" transporting messages back and front. For this I'd like to use Node.js. However, I might be missing the point but what's the use cases or drawbacks of using Node.js with a regular TCP connection versus a Websocket?
