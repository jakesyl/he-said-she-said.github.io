fl0w: are you asking about the transport itself? depends what your alternatives are. websocket seems like an obvious choice if you'll be doing two-way communication. depending on the frequency of updates, you could do a "long" post to the server or websockets. ws will (out of the box) give you some stuff like reconnection and error handling
