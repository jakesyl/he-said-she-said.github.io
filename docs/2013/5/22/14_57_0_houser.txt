I think there is one huge flaw with node.js which is reson enough to not choose it.....its one huge mess of callback functions...and the libs that exists to try to cut down on this are not really usable :/  Normally I really love lambdas and closures and such...its awesome...but in node.js it just gets to be to much.  Is it ever gonna get better?
