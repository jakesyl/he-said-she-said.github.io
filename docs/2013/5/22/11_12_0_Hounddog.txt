Hi i am having a slight problem with node and twitter... more a conceptual proble... I am creating an app that will be spawned several times on 1 server but with different connections database etc. now i need to connect these spawned apps to a twitter stream but there is a limitation that i can only do 1 connection per ip/user from twitter... so i guess the only way around is to create an app in between which collects information for all apps and connects
