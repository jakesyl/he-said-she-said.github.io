s5fs: I couldn't get it working. If I have "data.foo.bar.far" and, for example, foo is undefined, I get an error when trying to do "typeof data.foo.bar.far". Do I have to check each part of the "chain" separately? I was hoping there were some way to not have "if (typeof data.foo) …if (typeof data.foo.bar) … and so on :)
