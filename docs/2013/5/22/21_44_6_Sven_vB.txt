Stumbler, in that case you might want to try tmux or screen for the "keep on running even if not cnnected" part, and run their clients in a ptty to start listening to output. in cases where buffer delay is not a problem, you can also send output to a file and use tail -f to read from that file. if you can make sure to read the buffer fast enough, you can also use named pipes (man mkfifo)
