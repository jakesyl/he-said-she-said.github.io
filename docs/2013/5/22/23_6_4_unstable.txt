http://pastie.org/7945544 ... I have weinre and node installed. I installed node/npm in ~/.node; Then I added ~/.node/bin to my $PATH; I want to be able to do 'node weinre --boundHost -all-', though this fails as you can see from my pastie. If I do `/home/john/.node/bin/node /home/john/.node/bin/weinre --boundHost -all-` that works fine.
