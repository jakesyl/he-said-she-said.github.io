friends! when and how does a function call become asynchronious in nodejs? I have a function which uses an awessum s3 upload, I expect to be able to send my response from there, but node just happily continues, which is cool I guess, but I have a hard time understanding what part of the code is behaving asynchonious, I suspect awessum is doing it because I did nothing... :-)
