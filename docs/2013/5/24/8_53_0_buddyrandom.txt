chris: good to know .. here's the recurring problem i keep having i was worried those errors could be affecting. this is the end result of 'npm -g install bitcoinjs' .. i guess the version of node-gyp in the repo's just isn't high enough for the current version of bitcoinjs and i'll probably have to build manually? http://pastebin.com/n133VD3M
