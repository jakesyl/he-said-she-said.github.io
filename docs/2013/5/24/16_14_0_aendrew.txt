So, I'm new to Node.js but have been put in charge of incorporating it in my team's existing build process (Via Hudson). Any suggestions on how to do deployment? I'm looking at Haibu and am liking the cut of its jib (Being able to push an archive from Hudson to the staging and/or production server is really cool), but is there anything better or that I'm missing?
