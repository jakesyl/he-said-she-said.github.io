Hi! I'm having a Mongoose problem. I'm having a model, "Beer", which extends the schema of "Product" (ProductSchema.extend, using mongoose-schema-extend). In another model, "Review", I'm having a reference to a Product. In the cases when this Product happens to be a Beer, that field won't get populated. Should I do it manually somehow? Or simply abandon the extension of schemas completely? :)
