offtopic: any ssl enthusiasts up for a talk? i've issued quite a few as my own CA, but looking to buy from a trusted CA, there seems to be a million different properties i never even considered. e.g. # of server usage, domain/organization validation (familiar with EV). are there certain things i should be looking for to assure they're issued from a trusted CA across say, chrome, firefox, IE?
