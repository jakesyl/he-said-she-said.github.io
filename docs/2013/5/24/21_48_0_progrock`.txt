So I'm making a jsfiddle clone (from scratch) thats gonna use socket.io for collaborative editing. I need to set up a database to work with node to store the files (and possibly the 'undo' history)... I'm not super familar with ace, so gott see how I wanna do it.. was originally gonna create a git repo for each code project... but thinking baout using a nosql to store instead
