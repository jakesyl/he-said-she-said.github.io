i have a question regarding testing with mocha. before testing i need to put something in mongodb. there is the before() func in mocha, however the MongoClient functions are all asynchronous. i guess i have to use promised, but i am a bit lost here *how* to use that for example in a MongoClient.connect() call :/ anyone got a hint?
