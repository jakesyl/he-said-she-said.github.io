I am very new to node. Part of an app I want to build will require a process running while the user is not logged in to filter through tweets from twitter for that user and send out an email periodically. Is node going to be the right choice to handle this? The reason I want to use node is I know javascript (I come from front end javascript MVC frameworks) and I wanted to use sockets extensively
