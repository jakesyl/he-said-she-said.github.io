Hi guys, I'm looking to update node and npm from 0.10.7 to 0.10.8. I found this http://davidwalsh.name/upgrade-nodejs, but that didn't changed my node version number. I figured that I need to restart node, but I can't find any documentation on stopping, starting or restart nodejs for ubuntu. Any help would be amazing.
