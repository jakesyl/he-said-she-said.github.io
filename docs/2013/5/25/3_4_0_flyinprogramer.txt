so i'm on a mac, i've used the brew to install node, then removed it, and have used the node mac installer; i'm using a project that use grunt; i do what all the other people on my team do, which is 'npm install'  -- and it creates a node_modules folder; BUT unlike the rest of my team, i have to do ./node_modules/.bin/grunt  in order to run grunt; instead of just being able to do 'grunt' --- how do i fix this ?
