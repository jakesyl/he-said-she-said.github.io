is it possible to include 3rd party binaries in my npm package and have them be linked into the PATH? I've tried putting the binary in the bin folder and adding "bin": { "cwebp": "./bin/cwebp" } which does create the .bin folder with cwebp in it when I install the dependency. But when I run $ which cwebp it says it can't find it. am I going about this all wrong?
