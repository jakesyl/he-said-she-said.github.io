Hmm, I have a weird use case: Can I register something to be picked up by require()? e.g. normally, require("gorillascript") would link to my module, but when I'm in the gorillascript project, I'd like to have it use require("./lib/gorilla") without having to change actual references to require("gorillascript"), such as in a grunt build task.
