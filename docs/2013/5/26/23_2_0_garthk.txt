adam___: back to ckknight's example: you create an EventEmitter which OWNS the counter. You add a function to it which people call to increment the counter. That function emits the event when the threshold is hit. Anyone who wants to increment the counter calls the function. Anyone who wants to know when the threshold is hit subscribes to the event.
