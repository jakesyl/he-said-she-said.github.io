i want it not to use port 80 actually to proxy it, so i dont like io.listen(app) (which actually gives an error anyway btw for me) i wanna just listen io on some other port, but proxy to that from 80. i suppose express doesnt support it, right? any other thing like express's router thingy that can listen for ws connection and then i can just proxy it within callback? it work for xhr, but i cant make it to work for ws mode
