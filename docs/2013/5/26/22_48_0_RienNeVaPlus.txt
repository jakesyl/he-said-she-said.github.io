bnoordhuis: i am working on a multi request uploader with large files. i recieve chunked data from the clients browser, write it into a WriteStream and need the hash of the whole file. due to the fact, that the files might be very large, i want to avoid, reading them all over again after the last chunk request finished. so i toght i could store the 'pre'-hash of each chunk and assemble them together at the end
