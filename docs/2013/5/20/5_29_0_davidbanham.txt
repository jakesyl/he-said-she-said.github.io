Wraithan: True. There are implementations of things that will do that in libs like underscore, lodash, etc etc. If you wanted to pull in one of those you'd get a handy convenience method for it. You could also just write your own and tack it onto the prototype or access it as a global or something. The code would still be there, but it would make your source prettier.
