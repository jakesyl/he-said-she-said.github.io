If I wanted to submit a patch to connect-mysql to take advantage of a mysql pooling connection instead of a regular mysql connection, would I just add an if test to see if it was a pooling connection and then grab a new connection and free it for every query? https://github.com/nlf/connect-mysql/blob/master/lib/connect-mysql.js
