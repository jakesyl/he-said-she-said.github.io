hey i have some pretty basic/simple-minded questions. i'm making a portion of my app (this is the real bulk processing) a REST api that has NLP being done in the background in addition to a recommendation algorithm for some specific content which is pre-loaded on new content input rather than on new request. I've seen a lot about Go concurrency but I don't know anything about Go and project structures seem weird to me.
