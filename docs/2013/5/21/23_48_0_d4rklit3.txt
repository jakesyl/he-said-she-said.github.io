I can't seem to be able to do with with express 3. and nobody has ever been able to point me in the right direction. Im asking again because this time i really need this to be dynamic. I don't want to have to set up each apps pushstate routes on the node server. the idea behind my project is so that it assumes this unless routes are defined otherwise
