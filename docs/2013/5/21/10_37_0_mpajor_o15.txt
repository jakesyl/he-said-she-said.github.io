I'm about to write a UDP server that will receive a bunch of data; each line received will need to be matched against a regexp-pattern where I extract certain parts of the line received. Although, my concern is that I'd like to somehow write this in a clean way where I pretty much just define all my regepx-patterns in one big array. --
