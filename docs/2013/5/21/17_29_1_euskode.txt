Hey guys, when faced with a "FATAL ERROR: JS Allocation failed - process out of memory" issue, how can I force node to spit out a stack trace? I am using the memwatch library too but the leak event never seems to be fired, so all I've really got is that error and all my own logging around this for content, which thus far hasn't proven very helpful...
