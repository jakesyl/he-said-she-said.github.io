konobi: oh, the usual. The parsing itself is quicker in C, but the thinking takes bugger all time and I'd like to punt it to cheaper developers. So, yeah, in C as an addon is a great idea. There being a great many bloody strings involved, though, I'd like to walk V8's ternary buckets of existing strings so I can avoid creating new ones unless absolutely necessary.
