konobi: Oh, I wish. No, I really do have to wade through 90GB-1TB of highly repetitive XML and do something with it. I'm trying to do it in Node with a stream-handling approach so I can use back-pressure to avoid OOM. But, libxml2's parsing speed drops to ~10MB/s once it starts sending strings to Node, and I'd really like to go 10X that.
