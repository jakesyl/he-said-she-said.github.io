ericelliott, konobi: my preference for shrinkwrap would be for it not to keep an npm-shrinkwrap.json  around, it ought to be part of publish IMO, `npm publish --shrinkwrap` and npm-shrinkwrap.json never stays around and it should *only* include dependencies specified in "dependencies", regardless of what else is in node_modules/
