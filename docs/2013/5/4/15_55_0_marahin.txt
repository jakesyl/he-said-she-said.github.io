With regex and a callback my friend is trying to achieve shortened URL through gimb.us's API (which works this way: you request http://gimb.us/?url=http://the_url_you_want_to_shorten.com/ and it gives you back the $part, that you put after the slash [http://gimb.us/$part] - try it with google), but the function returns null. It doesn't care about http request, though it's theoretically executing and receiving it.
