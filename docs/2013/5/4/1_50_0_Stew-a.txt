konobi: Turns out there is an issue on github - https://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues/1727 though it looks like two issues mixed together (one of git modules not updating unless the version number changed, and one of git modules being looked for on the registry when they shouldnt) anyway, i guess i'll have to work around it, thanks
