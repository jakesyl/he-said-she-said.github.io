I'm trying to do client and server side rendering with dust.js, and I'm composing pages on the server out of templates nested 3 deep or potentially more. I want to establish a pattern for including styles inside <head> and scripts before </body> that will work on both the client and server. I'm currently using inline partials, but I'm not seeing how they will work on the client.
