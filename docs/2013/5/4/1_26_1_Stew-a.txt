my npm is being somewhat annoying. I wanted to add a module as a dependency through a git url, and it works ok with npm install, but npm update is fetching the newest version from git, noting the new version number then ignoring the rest of the git checkout and asking the npmjs registry for the package and getting a 404 for some strange reason
