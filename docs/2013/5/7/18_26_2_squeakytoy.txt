I have a very serious question. I have been looking at both the promise/q and async to avoid callback hell code. However, I have noticed that both q/promise and async is kinda bloated.. so I have written my own async control flow: http://paste.ubuntu.com/5642313/ <--- Is this totally new, or does q/promise or async achieve this with the same amount of code??
