the docs for Kue state that you can secure it using "TLS, or adding additional middleware like Connect's basicAuth()" https://github.com/learnboost/kue#securing-kue. i'm only really familiar with basicAuth. if i have kue on a production site, and i need a way to connect to the Kue interface, what is the best way to do this? is basicAuth safe? tjholowaychuk
