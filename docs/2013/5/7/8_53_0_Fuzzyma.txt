greelgorke - ok, I can access the form over req.form in the before-handler. But if I only attach the events and call next in the end-eventm the bodyParser wont do his job anyway (cause hes disabled for multipart). How I can use bodyParser manually here? (i want the access to req.body and req.files as always after this filter)
