Anyone trying Node for high throughput of cooked data rather than raw bytes? I'm trying to stream millions of tuples. JSONStream's parser tops out at 5MB/s, and adding minimal passthrough streams (using element-stream) lops off ~0.5MB/s each. My memory footprint is nice, but the job takes too bloody long.
