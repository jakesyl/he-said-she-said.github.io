AAA_awright: I think that the only thing I need to protect against is a fast rainbowtable attack on my stored hashes from a GPU. I'm storing user passwords on whichever small site I'm working on. If my hashes are stolen, my site is already compromised and I just need to try to protect the users from having their reused passwords compromised.
