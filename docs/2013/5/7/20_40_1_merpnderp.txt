AAA_awright: I usually write webapps, but I've got a person wanting more traditional CMS type stuff. It's been years since I've used a CMS but it always seemed like making it do all the one-off stuff the client needed was more of a pain that it was worth. Like the Event system wouldn't handle events like they wanted, or they'd need some special case for the photo management, or the user auth. Seems like I was always hacking it.
