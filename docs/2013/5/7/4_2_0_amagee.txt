Hey I'm trying to profile some javascript code but my v8.log file doesn't seem to contain any data about actual javascript calls.  i'm running node --prof blah.js on this file: http://dpaste.com/1115694/ but not getting any data about the calls to helloThisIsAProfiledMethod. Am I missing something obvious?
