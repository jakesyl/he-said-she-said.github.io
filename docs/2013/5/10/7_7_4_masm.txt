Hey, guys! I'm having a problem with an express server. It's returning 413 Request Entity Too Large for file uploads of a little more than 1 Mb. This was working fine a few weeks ago for uploads of 30 Mb. I have updated express version recently, but I can't find anything in the documentation for removing limits, and I'm NOT using connect's limit middleware. Any idea of what can be causing this?
