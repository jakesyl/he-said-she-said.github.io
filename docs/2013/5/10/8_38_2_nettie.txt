Hi guys, we're a RoR shop and we're building 2 new projects with node. Our dev team is having difficulties finding best practices and realword advises. I'm not sure if it's a lack of interest in the technology or maybe just too much infomrations, in part outdated. I was wondeirng if an online training course would be a good investment and would have enough updated content?
