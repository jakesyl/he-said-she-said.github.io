So, I'm trying to get AngularJS play nicely together with ExpressJS/Passport/NodeJS. I want to implement Facebook login and my server side implementation transfers data exclusively in JSON format (no HTML). I thought that using the built in session support in Passport would be enough, but when I do AJAX requests from my AngularJS app, the session doesn't seem to do any difference - it still says that my current user is not authenticated.
