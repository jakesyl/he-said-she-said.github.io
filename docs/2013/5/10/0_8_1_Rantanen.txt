keyosk: Any chance that what you're seeing in nginx log is.. Node sends message, Apache starts waiting for it to end, 2 seconds pass and node sends a new one. At this point apache realizes the first message wasn't complete, replies with 499 which nginx writes to the log - this is followed by a successful message from Node with roughtly the same timestamp?
