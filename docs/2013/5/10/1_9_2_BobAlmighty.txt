Hey guys, I'm having an issue installing Socket.io as a global package on my windows 7 x64 machine. I did find an article about C++ reditributable 2010 causing trouble. I uninstalled everything. Re-installed VS C++ 2010 express, updated SP1, installed compiler SP1. The error has gone away, but the package still isnt' installing.
