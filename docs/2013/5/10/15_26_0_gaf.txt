hi. I have a problem with nodemailer.Node is sending the email just fine, but  when I receive the email , the field "from:" doesn`t show the senders name and email address, although  I have  this       from: req.body.name + ' &lt;' + req.body.email + '&gt;', . This is my full code https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5555121
