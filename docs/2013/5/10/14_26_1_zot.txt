echo|: http://pastebin.com/4A9dVhEh gives the gist; unfortunately the real code has an extra (proprietary) layer between me and request, so this is not the real thing.  but i checked the args in the debugger, and they get through as expected.  (note: just realized that the URL gets passed in option block, but i didn't re-add it when trimming.)
