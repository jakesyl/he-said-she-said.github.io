so basicly I am using compound.js, compound-passport, and passport-local. I created a sample app and tested local authentication and it works great, very impressed. however now my compound app is not running. I have isolated it to the following problem: when npm install passport -l, compound fails to instantiate my data model. the code is here - http://pastebin.com/GmrMZmgxÂ the error is on line 2, Poem is undefined. however the exact same code worked fine
