So, I just updated to Node 0.10.5 (from 0.8.20, I think). When I try to install an NPM package, the versions that NPM lists as being available don't match what npmjs.org says. (For example, the package "aws2js" is up to 0.8.3, but if I try to "npm install aws2js@0.8.3" it complains that the most recent version is 0.6.9.)
