I'm writing some code that uses the request module, making requests to an endpoint that can return json or csv. If it's csv, then I convert it to JSON using a module that receives the stream of csv and turns it into JSON. I'm trying to figure out how to determine if the response is json or csv (without looking at the response type), and keep everything together with a stream.
