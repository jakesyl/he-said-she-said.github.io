What kind of explanations would help explain a 'http request timeout' from node -> apache on an internal lan, where the request doesn't even get to the machine (no apache access log entry) ? It doesn't happen often, and it happens when there isn't a whole lot of concurrent requests occurring. Currently the app has made 49328 requests, and 108 have come back with E_TIMEOUT
