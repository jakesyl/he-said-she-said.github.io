of the file causing the trouble? I can but I'm not sure it would be helpful. Its fairly standard stuff direct from the manual which worked fine in a different app. I was trying to make sense of authentication and started a new app so as to get the most bare-bones structure I could. The new app wouldnt let me use the built-in generators (what?!) but I carried on regardless and got authentication working. Now I copy the code from the old app into the new app
