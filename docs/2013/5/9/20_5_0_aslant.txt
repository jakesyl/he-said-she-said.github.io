substack: for me too. Need to find some free time. Ploy similar to something I've been thinking about. What I really want is to have servers spin up in response to tags rather than branches. The tags being semvers. The servers register themselves as services on seaport. Then I guess I'd have a json file relating tags to subdomains.
