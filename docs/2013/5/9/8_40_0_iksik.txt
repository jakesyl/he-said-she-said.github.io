i'm trying to write a small tcp proxy for mssql server (perhaps someone remember my questions related to this topic yesterday)... so, proxy works (http://screencloud.net/img/screenshots/55b5f24543fb91c269a72283f2a11b20.png), but after this little exchange of packets connection hangs, does anyone have any idea, if mssql is using some other ports than (ie. default) 1433 to continue communication?
