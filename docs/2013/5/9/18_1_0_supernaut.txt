isaacbw: i am working on a ReadStream and I never seem to get a 'readable' event after the first one when I start the stream.  the readStream is coming from fs.createReadStream.  the file exists and I am able to read all the contents of the file initially but any new contents added to the file never seem to trigger a readable event.  Can you advise?
