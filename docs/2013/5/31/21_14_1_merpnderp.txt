dypsilon: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to imply that there was anything wrong with the native mongdb driver. I use it along with mongodb. But when I select something from the DB, it's nice to have a mini-framework for hanging methods on that data. And when I'm writing to the db, it's nice to have node-validator built in to my objects.
