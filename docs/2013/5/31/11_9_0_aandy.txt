hi guys, i'm working on a very simple mechanism for graceful shutdown. the node part works as i wanted, but i'm wondering if i have a design flaw: currently i spawn instances using some env params, like PORT=..., but i can't really tell which pid is which (e.g. with # ps), any common ways of handling such? like, /tmp files with pid_port files or similar
