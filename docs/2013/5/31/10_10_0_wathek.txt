I have a PHP page with multiple articles I need to check the availabilities of these articles the problem here is that to check that I need to do multiple webservices calls and this can take time. So the idea is in PHP I send the list of the articles to NodeJS and NodeJS will check the availabilities and store them in memcached (so that when I need them later no need to do new Webservices calls).
