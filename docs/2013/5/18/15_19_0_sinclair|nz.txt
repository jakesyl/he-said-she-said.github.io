AAA_awright: the definition i think is highly contextual, as random data arriving over a stream may or  may not be meaningful, if it is meaningful, its a stream, if its not meaningful, its not. for example, you may be interested in the order in which things arrive, chances are you are not, but if you were, the sequence in which things arrive would matter.
