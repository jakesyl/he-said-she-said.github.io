A couple suggest seem to be RoR but it seems overkill and at times I feel there are new tools out that are as good or better. I wanted to know if node.js would fit my goal as far as making web apps that can do CRUD and help with things such as not having to write a user management part all by myself. I want to develop web apps quickly.
