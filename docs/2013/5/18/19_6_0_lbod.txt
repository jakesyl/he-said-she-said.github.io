hi guys, im having real problems handling uncaught exceptions with express and node. Are there any recent recommended docs on this? My code needs a serious refactor soon which ive been delaying, async and sync calls need to refactored and thats probably my problem at the moment. However I'm using the default error handling via express however some exceptions im only able to catch via process
