hello, is anyone here learning programming and node.js at the same time? I have some basic questions and would like some advice on how to start as I am not finding current material that will suffice to get me going....or at least I Dont feel comfortable. I can paypal $ if needed but I would like to start ASAP and I have alrready started learning some basic things that may help pursue this
