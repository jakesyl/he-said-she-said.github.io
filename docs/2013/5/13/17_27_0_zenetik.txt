another question, in a nodejs app architecture, what's the best practise to share a db connection between my modules ? I mean, i've got a users helper module, a workspaces helper module which both are using mongoose. At the moment i'm using global.mongoose in my mainapp so modules can use it. I'm sure it's the bad way, what's the good one ?
