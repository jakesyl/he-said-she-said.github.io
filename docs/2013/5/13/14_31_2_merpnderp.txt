greelgorke: it looks like you could use the two patterns together. An ActiveRecord's data persistence calls could call a DAO object. But i have no idea what that would gain you. I guess if your AR is going to be used in multiple projects with multiple backeneds, you wouldn't have to maintain two different AR implementations.
