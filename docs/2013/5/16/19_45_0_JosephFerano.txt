hello, I'm a bit new to web development and node.js, I need the web site I'm building to be able to run locally on a client's machine without a localhost, I am making ajax calls like load and getJSON, which fail in IE and Chrome when run locally, can node.js solve this problem for me and make it a one click launch for the end user?
