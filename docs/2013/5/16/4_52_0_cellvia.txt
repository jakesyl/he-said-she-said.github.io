i know this may not be the ideal place for this question but it came up from a node related issue when i was trying to run grunt.  for some reason when i run grunt now from windows commandline, if the folder im in has a grunt.js file, instead of following my PATH var to run the node grunt command, it is instead using my default windows file association to open the local grunt.js file in my text editor
