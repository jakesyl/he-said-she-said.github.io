I have a question about package.json files. Person X wrote a package and then abandoned it, and now I've taken over maintenance and support. Person X has asked that their name stay in package.json as the "Author", but I want to make it clear that contacting Person X for support is going to be a dead-end. Does package.json offer anything other than "contributors" that might help me with that?
