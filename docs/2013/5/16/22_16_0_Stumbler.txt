hmmmm, nifty.. so I guess (did a quick test), the setTimeout only ever fires if you can't establish a connection at all.   I get the timeoutfunction call if I point at an ip address that doesn't exist on my network, but not if I point it at anything else)    Guess it's moot now though, just learned something new :D
