Im a nodejs newbie, so bear with me if I ask stupid questions. I am trying to convert a file from UTF8 to latin1 (ISO-8859-1) using iconv-lite.

In the NodeJS docs it states that you have to give an encoding to writeFile, otherwise it defaults to utf8. http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_writefile_filename_data_options_call
