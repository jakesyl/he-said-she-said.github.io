ningu, ah, but here we disagree. I don't agree that accumulating knowledge on samples of a space necessarily leads us to better understand the fundamentals that form a space. Just like a hoarder collecting objects won't bring him any closer to understanding the universal laws of physics that these objects rely upon.
