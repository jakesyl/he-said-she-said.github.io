ningu, so isn't it maybe ironic you say having 6-8k languages is good so we can study the 6-8k languages... but if we had 10 languages, ... the reason to study 6-8k languages ceases to exist, therefore realizing this need to study this variations was a bubble feeding on itself and not as necessary to the world as thought.
