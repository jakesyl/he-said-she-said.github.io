i wanna capture the request of websockets ws:// in an express route, to proxy to socketio server running on other port - but doesn't work! Any middleware for express to support this? Would really hate having to do io.listen(app) or putting node-http-proxy on the outside, i wanna proxy it cleanly from inside an app.route for lot of flexibility. Any ideas how to do this?
