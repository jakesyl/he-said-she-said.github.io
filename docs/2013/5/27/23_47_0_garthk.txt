ningu: parsing repetitive XML into objects with timestamp, object name, instance name, counter name, and value. The timestamps and 99% of the values are numbers. Everything except the values gets repeated thousands to millions of times. I'd like to be able to crank through it at ~100MB/s, but right now I'm more like ~8MB/s.
