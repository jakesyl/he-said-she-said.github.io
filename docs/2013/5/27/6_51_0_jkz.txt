socketio IS on separate port, and express app on port 80. that seems to be the problem. If I connect direct to port 10000, socketio work in websockets mode. if i try to proxy it from inside app.route and then socketio connect on port 80, it only works in xhr mode. i wanna route it, AND for it to work on websocket mode. how to do this? is there a middleware to support listening for websocket connection in express?
