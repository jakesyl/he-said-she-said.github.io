https://gist.github.com/Industrial/316e53b1db0d0e9f673f I'm trying to set up nodejs on a vagrant box and compiling take too much time every time I generate the virtual pc. How do I install the binaries for node (linux x86) into a system location (no idea where) and have it be available for all users?
