yeah.. sometimes also being able to phrase the question you're asking is the most important.. like "what are some of the more popular approaches to control flow" vs "so, i have this callback thing that calls another with a done and when the done is done it's deep down, and i'd like to wrap it so that the callback in b is above the one in c etc etc"
