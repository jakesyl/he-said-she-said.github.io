BobAlmighty, no, this example doesn't use constructors, so there's no `clock.prototype`. The `clock` object being define *is* the prototype. You don't need constructor functions nor `new` to do OO in JS, and not using them gives you prototypical OO in its purest form (albeit the language doesn't give you good primitives to work with that out-of-the-box).
