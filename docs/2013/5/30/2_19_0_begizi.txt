I am using passport.js for authentication and ttezel/twit to handle the twitter stream api. twit uses event emitters whenever any tweets come in. I need to start 1 twit event emitter for each user but as of now whenever a second or third user logs in it creates a second or third user stream event emitter for all the users... any suggestions? any help greatly appreciated
