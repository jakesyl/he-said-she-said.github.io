Ah: "RFC 3339 deviates from ISO 8601 in allowing a zero timezone offset to be specified as "-00:00", which ISO 8601 forbids. RFC 3339 intends "-00:00" to carry the connotation that it is not stating a preferred timezone, whereas the conforming "+00:00" or any non-zero offset connotes that the offset being used is preferred."
