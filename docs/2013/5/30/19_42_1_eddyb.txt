bnoordhuis: I'm all derpy today. there's a discrepancy I forgot about: process RAM usage is 330MB, v8 reports a total heap of 290MB (which makes sense, the rest is the native heap), a used heap of 269MB (the difference is from the lack of compaction), but then a heap snapshot gives me a total of 170MB from all the nodes. so where's 90MB going?
