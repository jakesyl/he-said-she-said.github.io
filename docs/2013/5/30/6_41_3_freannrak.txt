Hello. I'm having trouble installing NodeJS to CentOS 6.4 following this guide (https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-install-and-run-a-node-js-app-on-centos-6-4-64bit). I ran into problems when executing 'npm -g install express supervisor'. Without sudo it runs, but throws permission errors. With sudo it says command not found. Here's my .bash_profile and npm config list: http://dpaste.com/1204656/
