i created an app with node+express+angular and got the following routing problem: when starting the server and clicking on links to the routes it works but when reloading the page with /shop (or any other route) i get an error (Error: ENOENT, stat 'C:\DEV\WEB\PROJECTS\iShop\views\product-list.html')
