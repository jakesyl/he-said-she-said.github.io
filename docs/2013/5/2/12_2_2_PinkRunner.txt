Hi, somewhat new to node.js but have it up and running and mostly doing what I want.  Say I fire up two or more browsers on the same machine to hit the server.  Is there any way in node.js to identify the client/browser?  (There is no login/username)  For example, one test scenario might be that the server is busy or slow so one browser would see that delay, but another browser hitting it at the same time shouldn't see that same lag.
