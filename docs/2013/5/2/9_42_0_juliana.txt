Good morning. i've got a problem with architecture of my application using express and mysql. I have created a function to handle route. This function should get data from mysql. So ive made callback which render page and pass it to function which queries mysql and if everything is ok  cb function is called. But my question is what should i do if  i need to make 2-4 queries for single page? the only way is to do it as a chain of callbacks?
