ok.. I am getting to the point where I just need to pay someone for support on how to get nodejs to work with digest authentication. Seriously the npm add ons I have tried fail, and writing the authentication in pure nodejs have proven to be frustrating even though I feel like the documentation on how to post and communicate to the server with json in the body was followed.
