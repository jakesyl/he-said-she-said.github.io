bubo, You're just simply trying to connect? I use that library without issues, but haven't used it with postgres - only MySQL. Assuming you've already tried using 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost for the host? Def sounds like it could be library related though if you're able to connect without issue the other ways you described.
