how do you guys feel about coffee script? I keep bouncing back and forth with interest. I enjoy using it for a bit, then decide I don't like it. Stop using it, then check it out again later. Not sure how I feel about the longer term maintainability… and being locked into that syntax. Maintaining the generated coffee files seems like it would be more hellish than just rewriting should one ever decide to stop using it…
