As all purely styling element, <strike> has been deprecated in HTML 4 and XHTML 1, and obsoleted in HTML5. If semantically appropriated, i.e. if it represents deleted content, use the <del> instead; in all other cases use a <span> element and style it with the CSS text-decoration property, with the line-through value.
