I am using node-orm2 (the dresende repo) and trying to use SSL to connect to a postgresql database, I've verified it works with non-ssl, but it doesn't seem to manage to connect or anything. It seemingly never calls the cb I give it, I think the problem is due to me using self-signed certs, anyone that could shed some light on this or is this the wrong chan and I should try and find a node-orm specific chan?
