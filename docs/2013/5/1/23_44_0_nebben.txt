I have a module that ports an API over a stream using mux-demux and dnode. Right now a user passes in a stream, I hook them up to mux-demux and dnode and do the rest. What I want to do is write a Duplex stream using the new streams2 API so that the user can do mymodule.pipe(stream).pipe(mymodule). What I am having troubles understanding is how to implement the _read and _write calls
