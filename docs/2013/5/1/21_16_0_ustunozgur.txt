Hi there, I'm reading a bunch of files, but I'm running into "too many open files" limit, I have changed the ulimit, but it didn't help. I have reverted to using readfilesync so that files are closed after each is processed, but I still get the error. Is there a way to force closing the file descriptor of a file read by readFile
