I am looking for a good way to find help writing a Duplex Stream subclass using the new stream2 interface. I am wrapping dnode and mux-demux logic in my library and want to present a stream interface. Does anyone have any good tutorial recommendations? I have gone through the API docs a lot, I just can't grok how to do _write and _read calls that work with the dnode and mux-demux instances
