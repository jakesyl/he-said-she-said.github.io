how do you guys handle versioning within your team while in development? Say your in development and you are creating a lot of npm modules. Do you follow semver and bump up the major version, minor version, bug fix, each time you make that type of change? Seems like we would hit 5.0.0 or higher before production if we did that. Whats the standard?
