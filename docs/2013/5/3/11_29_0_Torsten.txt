i guess i have a newb problem: i created an array (1), then i iterate through another array (2) with async.each() and in every iteration i push an item to the array (1). but if i want to access that array (1) afterwards, it's still empty. i assume i declared it wrong or messed up callbacks. please see code here: http://codebin.org/view/9915746c
