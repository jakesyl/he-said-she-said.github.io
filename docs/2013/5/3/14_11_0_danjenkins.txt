hi all, I've had an issue where using cluster and my workers were being disconnected but not dying after disconnection, i'm 99% sure its due to the node-mysql module with pooled connections, I've fixed the issue listening on process event of "disconnect" but this isn't in the docs within process, and only in cluster for the master as suchâ€¦ can anyone tell me if this is an official use of disconnect and if so why its not in the docs...
