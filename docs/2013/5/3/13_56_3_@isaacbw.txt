so down the road if someone decides to replace the driver code with a sort of lazy-loading DI system that doesn't even have an array to expose, all the code that assumed it would be an array always and forever would be broken. This is all abstract and probably doesn't apply to 95% of node.js developers and especially not DiegoMax's snippet, so you can safely ignore me
