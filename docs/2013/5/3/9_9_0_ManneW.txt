Hi! I'm trying to consume data from a JSON API using Restler within NodeJS. However, some of the requests to the API returns illegally formatted JSON (illegal newlines), depending on the query. I have no possibility to fix the response API, since it's a third-party product. Is there anything in the NodeJS eco system that allows you to fix some of those JSON issues, instead of just throwing the whole response away? :)
