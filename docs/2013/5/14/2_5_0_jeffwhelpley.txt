I am trying to set up WebStorm to Debug my node.js app while using something like Forever or Always (i.e. restart the app when files change). The problem is that the debugger attaches to the Always/Forever process instead of my node.js process. I realize that this needs to be a request to JetBrains, but wanted to see if anyone had any ideas of how to do this.
