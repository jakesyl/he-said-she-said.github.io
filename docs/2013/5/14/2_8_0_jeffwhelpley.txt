no, I don't want to test Forever. I know the common use case is for prod. What I am trying to do is to have my app running and then update as I am making changes. I already have a Grunt Watch task doing stuff like jshint and running unit tests. If I can get my app to automatically restart and still have debugging active then it would be nirvana.
