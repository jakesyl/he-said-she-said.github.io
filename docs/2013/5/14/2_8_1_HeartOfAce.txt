how can I format floating point numbers in JS? likeâ€¦ in C I'd do like a printf and then %.4f so that I only keep numbers that are like this: 1.2525. I can parse the number as a string and then add zeroes or remove numbers as I see fit, but it seems like a lot of hassle and I think someone must've thought up a solution already
