I've been trying to create a trivial benchmark CPU intensive on floats, and compare Node single process x the cluster, was expecting the cluster to perform times better than the single one, but it only seems to be about ~20%. I can see multiple node processes ivia the monitor, but only one is at 100% CPU, the other seem slacking.. without looking at the code, does it make sense?
