anyone have a second to talk to me about how to approach a problem and devise a solution with node/express? I've got a few sources of content, some from a local DB, some syndicated via RSS, etc. I want to fetch and display them all on a page. I can think of a view ways of doing this but I'm wondering if there's a "best" or "accepted" or something
