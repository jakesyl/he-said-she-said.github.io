Hey people. quick question about socket.io if anyone is familiar. I want to avoid including the following when my node server is offline. <script type="text/javascript" src="http://localhost:8080/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>. Unfortunately that script is included via a PHP-Yii framework function that registers a script when a specific widget is called. Any ideas?
