I'm a bit confused with how streams work on this situation. I need to pause a "task" (that is to say, store a function reference for X minutes), and that task needs to transmit a data stream. Is it possible to give that task a Stream, and have it pause the stream immediately, hold onto it for X minutes, and start it again? Or does a stream timeout or something..
