Hey guys. I'm hoping someone could help me out a little here - node: ../deps/uv/src/unix/core.c:167: uv__finish_close: Assertion `!(((handle)->flags & UV__HANDLE_ACTIVE) != 0)' failed. Is that likely to be a node related issue or a module related? Trying to work out where to start (my app randomly crashes with that after a random amount of time)
