hi all. I've been struggling to overcome an installer issue where 0.6.15 is my node version, but my software installer grabs formidable v1.0.13. I just wanted to ask before all taking all the steps building my installer... etc... should changing the "version" in my formidable package.json from * to 0.6.15 cause the right version to be pulled (1.0.9) ?
