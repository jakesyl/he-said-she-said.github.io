Hey, stream fiends! Got one for you: assuming an ordered array of URLs and a stream-eating monster, how can I best keep the stream-eating monster actively fed with the data the URLs point to? I want to start requesting data before the stream-eating monster needs it, but not get so far ahead of it that I run out of RAM.
