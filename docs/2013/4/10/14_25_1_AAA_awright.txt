pachet: My usual example is if you're using plain SHA-1 for hashing anything, you're verifyably and provably doing it wrong; that's a cryptographic primitive and not secure by itself, for checksums, you use a MAC like HMAC, for pesudorandom strings you use a KDF, for passwords you use a PBKDF like PBKDF2
