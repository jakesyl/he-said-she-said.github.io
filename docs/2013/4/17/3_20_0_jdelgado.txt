@kenperkins Oh absolutely, I just mean I think it is an amazing resource to simply start a new instance if one isn't working over at AWS rather than having to man an entire datacenter and worry about hardware. I think it is a great resource for service providers, but I don't see the usefulness for end companies. That's all.
