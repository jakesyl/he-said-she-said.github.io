jdelgado: in general terms yes, i'm more interested in knowing if the _debugger Interface class can do it all for me without me having to handle RPC stuff myself though (eg: have node process A connect an Interface to node process B and give it commands, which seems doable as it's all just TCP V8 debugger protocol stuff)
