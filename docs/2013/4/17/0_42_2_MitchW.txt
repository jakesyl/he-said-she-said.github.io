any node.js devs here know what would be required (roughly) to use _debugger Interface/Client on a V8/node context created from vm.createNewContext (I noticed the V8 context itself isn't exposed to JS, I'm happy to make a local patch to do that - just not too familiar w/ V8 itself to know how I can hook everything up - I suspect it may not even be possible and I just have to go w/ a child process which is probably better anyway)
