hello.. I am trying out node-gyp... in the instructions it says install it with npm install -g node-gyp   it then says to change directory into my app and then type node-gyp configure  ... this is supposed to look for binding.gyp inside the current directory... when I type this command I get 'node-gyp' is not recognized as an internal or external command
