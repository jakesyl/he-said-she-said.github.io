hey I'm trying to set up a webserver in node as a means to reroute incoming http requests to an internal rpc local socket connection. I want to take something like http://localhost/my/controller/method, strip off the path and convert it to some other format and use that for an rpc method call, and I also want to handle this in a restful way. Originally I was looking at express, but I'm thinking maybe just plain node might be better, any thoughts
