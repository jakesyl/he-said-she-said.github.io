I'm confused about how runInThisContext works. When I put 'var a = function(b,c) { return b + c; }; console.log(require('vm').runInThisContext("a(2,3)"));' into a file and run it with 'node filename.js' I get an error message about 'a' being undefined. I don't see anything in the documentation that explains why this might happen.
