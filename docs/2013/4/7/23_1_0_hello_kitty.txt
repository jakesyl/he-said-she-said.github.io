I'm trying ot write an object (it is supposed to be a string of javascript code, but I don't really knwo what it is) to a file. When I console.log the object I can see my desire javavscript code... when i fs.writeFile the object all i get is a file that says [Object object] -- how do i force it ot be a string? (or whatever it is that console.log does that makes it look like text)
