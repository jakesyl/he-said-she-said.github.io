When making a stream-next transform stream. I'm doing a bunch of async operations that eventually call push(), but calling done() right after I set all that up. I'm not sure I fully understand the conseqences of my actions. Something tells me that maybe, just maybe I should wait until I've actually processed my async operations to call done();.
