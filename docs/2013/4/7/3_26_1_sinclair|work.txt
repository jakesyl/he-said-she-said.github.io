OTBS4Life: being quick and easy to get something up and running is not always the best thing, if you need to write an application that needs to updated and maintained for the next 5 to 10 years, i just don't think node is the right call. at least now, when libraries and frameworks are changing monthly, and node itself hasn't hit its own version 1.
