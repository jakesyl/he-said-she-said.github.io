i'm using the node-mysql library... when i do a connection.query(updateQuery, function(err, results) { console.log(results); });      // { affectedRows: 1, message: '(Rows matched:1 Changed:1 Warnings:0)', ........ you get the idea. it's not the model which was inserted. is this what's supposed to happen?
