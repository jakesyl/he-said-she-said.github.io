Say, I was designing something like twitter or facebook, a timeline or whatever. I would need a pubsub system for clients to receive real-time pushes of new posts/tweets/whatever. I could make a "new-post" channel to publish when new posts are created, but what if some posts are private or a client doesn't have authorization to receive the post?
