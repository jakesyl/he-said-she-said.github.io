hi all, node.js noob here - i fancy writing some stuff in Azure with Node - sql server looks like a ball ache to use to query, get results from etc - i'd have to make loads of utility functions. That aside, what happens when there's a sql error, how does node respond? Is there a node try { } catch { }?
