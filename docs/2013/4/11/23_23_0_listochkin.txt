Remy: I mean, suppose I have a module A that does something potentially dangerous. I want to wrap a function in that module in a domain dA. Now suppose I require that module A from module B. And inside that module I've already created a domain dB. What I want is to use dB inside of A instead of creating an extra domain dA since my code is now protected by that external domain. Is it possible and is it a good idea?
