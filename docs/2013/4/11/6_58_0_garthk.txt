ChrisPartridge: yep! Though, I wrote a more generic 'catstream'. It takes an input array (sorry, not a stream) and a function, runs each input through the function to get streams, and pipes each stream in turn to an output stream. Half the code handles errors and edge cases, e.g. not being able to get an input stream, one of the inputs emitting an error, etc.
