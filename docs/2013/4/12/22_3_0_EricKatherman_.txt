Can someone shed some light on what might be causing my stack size exceeded error?  When I run my query on my local node installation, the query returns all the data.  Against my live node server, it doesn't.  My query includes a "rows_per_page" attribute that when set to 1080 or less, the live API does return them, but higher than that and it dies with a stack size exceeded error
