i am building a node.js app that suppose to recieve 300 requests per second of a small json objects from a RabbitMQ. each json object will be recieved by the node process, and node will send it away over http or save into a file and sent with ftp. how many req/sec can a single node handle? i am trying to estimate the number of machines i'll need (assuming 1 node per machine, 2GB RAM)
