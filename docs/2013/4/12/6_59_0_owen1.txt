i am building a node.js app that suppose to recieve 300 requests of small json objects from a queue. each object will be sent over http or save into a file and sent with ftp. how many req/sec can node handle? i am trying to estimate the number of machines i'll need (assuming 1 node per machine, 2GB RAM)
