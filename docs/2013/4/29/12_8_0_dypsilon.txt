sinclair-work, yeah, I'm beeing only half serious here. Ofc one should try to code as clear as possible and follow the classic OOP everybody understands, but I also like the JavaScript patterns. A lot. And I don't want to implement Abstract Factory pattern or the Strategy pattern again, just because my language is so square.
