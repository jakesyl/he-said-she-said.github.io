I have an idea, but its seems kinda obvious, would a cloud based firewall be a dumb idea? I mean, use AWS ec2`s and route 53, route 53 would be used to distribute the network load, and the ec2`s would filter the traffic, block UDP (amplification ddos), and use the cloud computing power to filter TCP floods, and the layer 7 attacks is another storyâ€¦ I have been asking this for a while now...
