OK, so, I'm LOVING programming in node. I know NOTHING about npm, however. So, I want to commit my code to version control and, when I pull the code back into a new directory and want to get a second copy of the server running on the same machine (or a different port) what should I need to do to get the new copy running? Node is on the box (as I've been programming on that box....) Should it work after I do a "npm install" in
