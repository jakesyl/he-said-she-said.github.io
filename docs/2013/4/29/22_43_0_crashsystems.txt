Would anyone mind looking at an annoying bug in some code I've written? To learn node, I decided I'd write a chat server using socket.io. I've got two pertinent events the server-side code is listening for: requestName and chat. The bug is that if requestName has already fired, the chat event never fires for that socket. http://pastebin.com/Z2fs0g6e
