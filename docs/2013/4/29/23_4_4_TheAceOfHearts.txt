soâ€¦ does anyone have any cool project ideas they'd like to share? I'm a computer engineering student, and my team and I have to develop a large application for next semester. The team has an algorithms/C/C++ specialist, an android specialist, a web specialist, and the manager, which is the glue that keeps us together. Any ideas for cool stuff? It has to be something pretty big, and we're gonna make it open source if we actually create it
