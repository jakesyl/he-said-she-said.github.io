So, am trying to install latest Node.js on a RHL linux. Got the latest tar (node-v0.10.2-linux-x64.tar.gz), unzipped it to a folder (/usr/share). The configure file is in /usr/share/node-v0.10.2-linux-x64/lib/node_modules/npm. I did a ./configure, but I see nothing happening. Am I doing something wrong here?
