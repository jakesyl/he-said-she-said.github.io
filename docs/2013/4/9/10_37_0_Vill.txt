Hello, could I ask for help, I'm using Socket.io and my sockets which are not connecting on LOCALHOST are disconnecting after approx 30 seconds, and the page needs to be reloaded to get new socket, it's really frustrating, because after page loads, it takes like 10 seconds to connect socket, so actually, the whole period of time when the connection is established is pretty short
