ningu: thanks for the tips….   obviously I do my best error catching, and I have mostly just found errors while developing and flushing them out… but in going through that process of watching the entire server DIE COMPLETELY when I am testing something it made me think, "Uh, that could be bad if 1 user does something stupid that I didn't check for and it just dies.."
