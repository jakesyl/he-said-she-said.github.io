mbalho_: I don't think so. I asked on stackoverflow what is a way I can program html apps and node.js apps the same way (because it's different: on html I have to add <script> tags and then my file - on node.js I call require ON the file - and you have to do some weird things for a lib to be compatible with both approaches)
