pringlescan: another example; i have a WHOIS lookup web server that runs on 16 cores using the cluster library. only about 4-5 cores get any usage at all, and the traffic sent to each cluster process is totally random - many see no traffic at all. i've only found one reference to this huge problem (some kind of linux kernel interaction), in an obscure github issue.
