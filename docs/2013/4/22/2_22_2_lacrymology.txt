It looks like my `this` is not what I'm expecting it to be in a prototype function. Probably because it's being called as a callback from the async module. Any way I can help this? it worked when I defined all the prototype functions from within the constructor, but I've been told that was Bad, but when I change that, then I cannot do the `var self = this` trick anymore
