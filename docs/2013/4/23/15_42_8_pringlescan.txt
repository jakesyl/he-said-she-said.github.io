Hello all, I'm working on a project that helps school kids find the safest way to walk to school based on crime. I was initially doing it 100% in Node.js with no database, but my dataset was too large to do everything in memory without Node freaking out. I've been putting in 16 hour days for the past few weeks working on it, and I have a few hours left and I'm so close, but I need someone to bounce ideas off ofâ€¦ are you guys in?
