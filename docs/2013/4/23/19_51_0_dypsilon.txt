rapsli, ok, so what you need it understand: 1. function is a type. so you can pass it around like an integer 2. function is an object. 3. "this" is a special variable that is "bound" to a function. so you can use the function on different objects by rebinding this. 4. function has the scope it's been defined it, not where it's been call (closure)
