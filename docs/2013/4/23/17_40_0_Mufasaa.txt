@hij1nx its still work in progress :)  But its is supposed to manage an underlying BSD/OpenIndiana Server.   The node server is governing the process(es) the machine is runs on demand.  Different api calls initiate different actions, web can be used for that as well but is primarily for reading the status of different activities on the server and the console is to perform tasks as well, the same as the API but locally.
