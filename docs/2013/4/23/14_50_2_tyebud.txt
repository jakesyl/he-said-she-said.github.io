Hey node, quick question regarding setting variables with functions using callbacks.  I'm trying to create a function that takes a search param and returns the twitter search results using the request package.  I'm fairly certain I'm misunderstanding how to use a function with a callback, so any help is appreciated.  https://gist.github.com/5444143
