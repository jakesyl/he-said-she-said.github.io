I have 600k crimes, 250k unique points where crime occurs, 80k nodes in the road network, and 15k roads/ways (for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)â€¦ for each unique point, I have what crimes occured there, the nearest existing road node, and the closest point to the crime on the road (like a GPS would start you off, the lat/lng that is closest, not necessarily an existing road node).
