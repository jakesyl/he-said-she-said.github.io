when i'm doing file opening and writing without http.createServer(function (request, response) thing and executing script from cmd then the file is created and script works fine. When i'm trying to execute that by the browser there is an error 500 and error like "binding.close(fd, makeCallback(callback));           ^ TypeError: Bad argument" and file isn't created nor edited.
