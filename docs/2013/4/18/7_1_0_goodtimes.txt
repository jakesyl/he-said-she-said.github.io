i'm attempting to fetch and parse Gmail messages, and doing so through the aforementioned node imap module. The problem i'm running into is searching/fetching a single email for further parsing of its actual contents. I'm attempting to use the message's 'UID' but for some reason I get nothing back when I search via the UID
