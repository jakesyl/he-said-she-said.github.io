Hey guys, I'm running into an interesting problem. I am assigning a bunch of variables to process.env, like so process.env['field_name'] = item; Sometimes item is string boolean, so I convert it to a true boolean before assigning it. For some reason though, when i access the field after assignment it is still a string. Why could this be?
