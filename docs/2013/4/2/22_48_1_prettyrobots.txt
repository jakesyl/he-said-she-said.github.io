I'm heads down trying to write out all my modules and want to make sure that when I'm ready to publish, that there won't be a need for a rewrite. From the sound of it, I don't have to worry. Hearing people debate modules and control flow, that's a cause for concern becuase changing those things significantly changes the shape of the ecosystem.
