sorry if this is a bit of a 'beginner' q..... we are developing a site in php Yii framework which is a membership site. Within the membership site we have 'member groups' and are looking to offer these member groups the ability to chat with each other in the specific groups. We're looking for an option that is light on resources and can tie into our existing database. Do you think that node.js would be a good option for us?
