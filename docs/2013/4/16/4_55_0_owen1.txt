I followed the steps here http://gofedora.com/how-to-configure-secure-ftp-server-vsftpd/ and setup vsftpd. I try to upload a file. i use the 'put' command and i see: '130 bytes sent in 00:00 (1.81 KiB/s)'.  When trying from node-ftp I get:  Error: OOPS: vsf_sysutil_recv_peek: no data.  here is the complete log and the code: http://hastebin.com/bafusagafu.tex
