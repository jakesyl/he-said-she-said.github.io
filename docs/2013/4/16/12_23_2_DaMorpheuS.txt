`3rdEden: do you have some short examples of this because what i encounter every time again is that the websocket is working fine i tested some code functionality but when i send a normal get to the server i get those cross domain bs i don't know how to tackle this correctly. I send my response headers with allow origin and stuff but i don't know what i'm doing wrong here
