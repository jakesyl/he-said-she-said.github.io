I am parsing a 800+mb XML file. I am streaming it from S3 and running it through a SAX parser, modifying the data, adding it into mongodb, and then creating a new xmlfile and streaming that to disk for sphinx, and then streaming the saved file from disk to S3. Everything works fine on localhost. V8 kicks in and memory never goes about 120mb. On heroku however, memory is blowing up and reaching the max memory within about 30-40
