hi there everybody, this is a public service announcement! i just pushed new versions of my binary parsing/serialising modules, https://github.com/deoxxa/dissolve and https://github.com/deoxxa/concentrate, updating dissolve to use node 0.10's stream API and adding a streaming interface to concentrate. i'd be interested to know what people think of the second example at https://github.com/deoxxa/concentrate#usage - thanks!
