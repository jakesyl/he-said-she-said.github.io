although it is possible to see the same data just by requiring a file in common and relying on the fact that 'require' caches its first result for a filename and returns the same module.exports value for any subsequent 'requires' of the same file, this is a nasty thing to rely on, because pretty soon you'll be wondering why you get two totally different objects in two modules that both depend on a third module via npm
