Hi. 'forever' is forking additional copies of itself, which try to start redundant copies of my app, and fail, thus churning the CPU. This doesn't happen right away; it may be an hour or two until it starts happening. Meanwhile the original instance of 'forever' is still there and its child process, the app, is running just fine. Has anyone else seen this?
