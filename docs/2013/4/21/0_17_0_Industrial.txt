mbalho: Another weird idea; req, res pairs are both streams right? say I have several node processes, a proxy and 3 apps; Can I pass/stream req/res pairs from the proxy to the app nodes, so that I can use req header info to decide which app to route to, and then use the req/res pair in the app to send and end the response?
