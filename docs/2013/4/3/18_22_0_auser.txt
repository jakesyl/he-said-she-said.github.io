curious thing happening with the node_redis npmâ€¦ anytime the redis server cuts off a connection, it tries to reconnect and fails to do so (I'm assuming AUTH'ing has something to do with it), more sockets keep opening up and try to connect to the redis server until I have hundreds of sockets opened per the process
