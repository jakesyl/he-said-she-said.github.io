I have a REST api and a mobile app.. what is the best way to provide authentication?  I'm looking at oauth2's Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant ("password" grant_type) [http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-27#section-4.3], however, no libraries seem to have support for this.. am i looking in the wrong place or thinking of this wrong?
