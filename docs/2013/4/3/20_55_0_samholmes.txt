I was thinking of making a very straight forward system that works like this: 1. You send a file to the server. 2. It stores it and returns a unique resource ID (hash). 3. You can store this resource ID in what ever database system your app is configured to use. 4. your app can request that image in different dimensions (resized/cropped)
