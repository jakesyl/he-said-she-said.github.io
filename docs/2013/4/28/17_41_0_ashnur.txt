niggler: by the way, i understan you do not like my comments, but I still honestly believe that licenses & copyrights are a solution for a non-existing problem. the issue is not that people are stealing each others work, the issue is that any kind of work can be so valuable that it is worth stolen. in a healthy society well values are shared no such thing is needed. maintaining these lies might be beneficial
