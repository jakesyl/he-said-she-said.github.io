https://github.com/alexch/learn_javascript ... I wanted to start playing around with some javascript/jasmine for fun. I found a neat set on github I wanted to try. I wanted to run the tests from command line, like rspec/ruby, using phantomjs. I have phantomjs installed, how can I (if possible) run these tests without a web server? Just find out which tests are passing/failing.
