Hi, I'm starting with Node.js + Meteor.js - I want to install Meteorite (yet another package manager), however when I run "npm -install meteorite" everything is installed in ~/node_modules and also creates many more dirs (tmp, .node-gyp, etc). What would be a "best practice" for packages? Isn't there something like virtualenv for Py?
