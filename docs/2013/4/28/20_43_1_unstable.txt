I just installed npm locally. In my ~/.npm/*/*/package I have a bunch of directories with 'bin' in them. How can I have a central bin for all of them? So I can add one thing to my $PATH and not forty. So for instance my ruby environment, all my dozens of binaries/gems can be in one place: ~/.rbenv/versions/2.0.0-p0/bin/, and I just add this to my $PATH and everything works.
