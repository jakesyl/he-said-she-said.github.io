I want to port the Open Source Routing Machine's routing engine to Javascript (just the routing, not the part that does the contraction hierarchies). The data files for an entire city is only 25-30mb uncompressed, and anything that takes 3ms of a VPS would probably reasonably well on a modern smart phone. It likely won't be faster; but it won't require a data connection.
