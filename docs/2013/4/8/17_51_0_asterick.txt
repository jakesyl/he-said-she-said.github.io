Scala is intended for concurrency, much like most functional languages.  If you are handling a large number of concurrent processes, it is probably not a bad language.  It can be clunky though.  Node is great is because it's a familiar language, but it doesn't really do concurrency persay (just async callbacks).  The benefit there is no locking.  It can also abstract away code flow.
