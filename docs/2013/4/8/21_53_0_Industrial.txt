Trying to test this program https://gist.github.com/8613fdd72649b9a3fa86 with input `echo foo/*lol*/bar/*abc*/baz | lsc -d app` yields foobarbaz like I expect. The only case that is not yet covered is when I am in a comment and there is no match for an end-comment until the end of the current chunk, in which case I'd like to drop the chunk. I dont want to emit this data. What do I do here? call the callback
