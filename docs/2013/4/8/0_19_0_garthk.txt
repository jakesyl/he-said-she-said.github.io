rvagg: that's what I was hoping for â€” being able to sort on the way down so I could skip data instead of filtering it. The data I'd need for one job would take 23 days to write at this rate. I'm reading it from the raw source at 8X this rate. My goal is to write it to an intermediate format from which I can read back a lot faster.
