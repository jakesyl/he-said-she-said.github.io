is it ok for me to ask npm install questions there? Im trying to use node-xmpp-bosh with a third party app and it appears that nmp install ltxt is finishing its install, but has  couple warnings and when i try to run the bosh proxy, i get an error that it cant find the ltx module. Here is the output of the install and error http://pastie.org/pastes/7375900/text?key=b6k6gaa2rgbtflqyvbmnew
