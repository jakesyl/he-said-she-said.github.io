Hi #node.js. I'd like to run different node projects with different node.js versions. Is there a setup where I could just run "node app.js" and the version of node used will be automatic based on the engines in package.json. Or should I be thiking along the lines of doing a "nave use 0.8.19" switch each time before I even execute node?
