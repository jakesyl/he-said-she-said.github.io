I have a really weird issue with sessions in express, we have our own session manager and for some reason express calls SET on each HTTP request despite the GET request being succesful, I can't figure out how to solve it..  Anyone can spare a few mins to cast their eyes over it please?  https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/commit/e06da4bf650d
