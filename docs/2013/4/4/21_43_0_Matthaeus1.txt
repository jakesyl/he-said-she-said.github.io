Alright.  Here's my question:  I'm using ws, and trying to catch an error via a callback thus:  socket.send(data, function(err) { console.log(JSON.stringify(err); });  I'm seeing empty objects as errors (not undefined or null as with success, but literally {} on error).  How can I track down what type of error this is?
