draginx: from http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/: "It gets slightly more complicated if the resource author wants to be able to handle cross-origin requests using methods other than simple methods. In that case the author needs to reply to a preflight request that uses the OPTIONS method and then needs to handle the actual request that uses the desired method (DELETE in this example) and give an appropriate response."
