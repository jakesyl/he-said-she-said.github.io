ningu: the way i've gotten around that by just saying "json objects are separated by newlines. deal with it.", and using "content-type: application/json; layout=line-stream", but if you want the response to be a real object, maybe you could just go super lo-fi with it and .write('{"objects":[') ... .write('],"resultNum":' + x + '}');
