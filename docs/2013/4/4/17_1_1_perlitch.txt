i am making a "Datasource" wrapper class for the websocketâ€¦ oh hm maybe i can make a promise in the constructor for the connection establishment, then if a ws method is called on the wrapper, it checks if the connection is established; if it is, it just calls ws.send(), otherwise it just gets added to promise.done()
