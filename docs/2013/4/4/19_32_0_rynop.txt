I'm gonna write a daemon that goes off and concurrently d/l lots of rss feeds, and parses em. I'm a node noob trying to fig out if node will not do this well. I've read stuff about the single threaded event loop and async worker threadpool, but what I dont get is how it acts on a problem like this (not http server).  If I do 2 concurrent URL requests and both come back @ same time - will I only be able to parse XML on one at a time?
