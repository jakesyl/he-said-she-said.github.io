hallas: giving deployment advice is a bit like giving legal advice; it's a bad idea unless you're getting paid for it, because you're going to be held accountable for it if it's incorrect or if who you're talking to interprets it incorrectly. basically, if you want to do it right, you really should pay someone (even just part time) to do it for you. (and no, i'm not just trying to sell my own services here, i'm busy enough as is)
