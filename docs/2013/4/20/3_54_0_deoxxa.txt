bitRipperX: 1) remote site asks your site for a token, where public/private components are generated and the pair is given an "unpaid" status, then both components are given to the remote site securely 2) client is redirected to your site, with the public token, where it's potentially paid for somehow 3) client goes back to the remote site, so the remote site asks your site about the public token's status. if it's unpaid, go to step 2 and repeat. otherwise
