hello! i would like to use node to build a website.. while i do know js i'm a bit of a noob with node. I've been looking at meteor but i'm not sure it fits my purpose. So i'd like to replace meteor with a bunch of custom code. yet i dont know how to handle the frontend serving aspect. Is there any documentation to get me started in that direction?
