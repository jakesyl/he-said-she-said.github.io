If I take a look at the stream library landscape i see a lot of nice stuff but I'm not sure how to use them effectively. Say I already have an express app that serves static files and has some JSON REST handlers connecting to a MongoDB database server. I understand that most of the connections at some point are already expressed as streams, but I'm not sure where I could use streams elsewhere effectively to solve a problem.
