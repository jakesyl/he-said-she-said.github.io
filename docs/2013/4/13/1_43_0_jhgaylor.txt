niggler: lets say I own that same store and now i want to computerize my work tickets.  I have 4 retail shops and 30 employees.  i want to use tablets to record sales and new repairs.  i want my employees to be able to see jobs to be done and notes about the jobs, etc all in real time.  django isn't going to cut it.
