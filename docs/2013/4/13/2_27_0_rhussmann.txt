Yeah, I like Markdown. I didn't do a great job of asking the question, I think. I need variable/text substitution (like Jade offers, in the form of variables), and conditionals (also like Jade offers), but I don't want the output to be HTML. The input will be a text file with template fields, and the output will be a text file with the fields substituted.
