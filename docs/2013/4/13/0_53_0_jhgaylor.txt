Hi.  i just finished reading javascript allonge which did a good job of covering the language and gave some examples of how to build common function like extend, splat, and how to do things like context agnostic mixins.  I was hoping that someone might suggest a good book to read covering building a javascript web application.  I was hoping things like managing state, routing, templating, etc would be covered.
