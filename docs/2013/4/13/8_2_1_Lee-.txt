idk either. I try to get clients to work using the examples, but tehy're obviously written for a browser. I get errors when I try to run them via node. I don't know if it's a problem with me or that these libraries I have tried simply are not for node clients, just browser clients. It's very frustrating not knowing where the problem lies :\
