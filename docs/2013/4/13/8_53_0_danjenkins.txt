I've set up the replication and my couched server doesn't have an admin account right now, but in my logs all I'm getting is Replicator: couldn't write document `worm`, revision `4-e6680146f2f22b3f9490afeb38fd2a0c`, to target database `registry`. Error: `unauthorized`, reason: `Please log in before writing to the db`.
