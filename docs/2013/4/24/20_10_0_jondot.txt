deoxxa, actually this is so exciting, that I'll update the blog to include your library. if I ever have enough content for a part 2 then I'll do more. I guess a part-2 can be performance considerations - or perhaps you can write about your experience in your blog, it sounds very interesting, and I'll link you :)
