The problem I'm seeing is that the firing interval occurs as I expect, but the heartbeat request callback doesn't execute until the very end of my whole process running, so the "alive" bit is never toggled, and I see console output of "_____ IS ALIVE!!!"   only at the very tail end of my program execution.
