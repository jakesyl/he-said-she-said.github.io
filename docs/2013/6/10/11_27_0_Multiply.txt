ningu, kinda yeah. What I have is multiple projects, where I listen for file changes to their project.json files, and in those, I define which domain they should run from. When a change is made, that requires the server to restart, it should unload it, and start it back up again, gracefully. Ie. by issuing ctrl+c.
