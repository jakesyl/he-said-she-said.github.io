Is there a lightweight process manager, built with node? Currently, I have a pool of say, 50 ports, each may run a specific node process or other program on that port. Some programs user serveral processes. I'd love to be able to simply spawn a process, maybe even in a "screen" with the process name and port as the title. And still be able to start and stop it, from node (ie. sending ctrl+c?)
