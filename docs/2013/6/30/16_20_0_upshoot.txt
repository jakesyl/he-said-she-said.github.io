Blacthorn, hm... I thought that if you do something like fetching a database result, or reading a file, node continues to loop while the function runs, assuming you make that activity a callback.  the point of the callbacks is to clear the event loop..but once you are not in the event loop, I thought you might be able to do synchronus stuff.  I guess I'll have to look at that more.
