first timer question here - I'm trying to deploy an app on my server, and I have a ~/public_html/ folder that is the parent publicly available folder. Does this mean that I can run the app in any folder, and assume the my 'app.get('/test', function(){});' would correspond to /public_html/test ? Do I have to do 'app.get('../test');' or make it correspond to the folder structure?
