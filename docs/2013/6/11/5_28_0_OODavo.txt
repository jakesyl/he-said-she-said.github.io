What's the "nicest" way to get modules in the browser that vaguely resemble the kind you get server-side with Node? browserify's ability to provide a require() looking just like Node's, and its ability to use npm packages, are both great, but the compiled file is kind of a huge mess. RequireJS and related solutions need one's code wrapped up in yet another closure. What other options are there?
