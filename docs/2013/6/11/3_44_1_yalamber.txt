Hello, I am a bit confused about nodejs and db connections, I am using node-mysql from felixge. What I am confused is I am creating a single connection from nodejs app. Now when multiple users will be using that web app and they all will be using same connection right? will they have to wait for each other query to complete in order to get results?
