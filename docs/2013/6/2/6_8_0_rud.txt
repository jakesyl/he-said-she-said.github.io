hrmm in socket.io, i have a simple .on('connect', function(socket){…}) which itself emits a node event (passing the socket.id as argument), than another object has a node listener and picks the event, and does *stuff* on the socket. to do said stuff, and since i'm only passing the socket.id, i need to retrieve the socket object from the io.sockets pull, i therefore use the io.sockets.clients() method and iterate until i find my matching socket.id… fine …
