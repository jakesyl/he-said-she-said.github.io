I've set up passport to authenticate a socket.io web socket: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15093018/sessions-with-express-js-passport-js But what if I want to allow non-authenticated users to connect too, just to restrict what they're allowed to do? I have a game, and I want non logged in users to be able to watch, but only logged in to be able to join.
