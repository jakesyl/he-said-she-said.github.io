Hi everybody, I'm using async module to do parallel function call but I need an advice. So what I'm doing is that my node js server receives data from Redis which is a list of articles so for each article it calls a function that will do the async.parallel call to multiple other functions to check the availabilities of that article. Once we get the availability we store it into Redis in a new list.
