Guys I am trying out passport for authetification. if you check app.post('/login', line   at http://jsbin.com/ibagew/1/edit  you can see in redirects  to aaa on success  and passport authetication callback is doing just this   return done(null, user); so this should count as success shouldnt it? problem is I get redirected to bbb - failure
