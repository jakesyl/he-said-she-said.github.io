hi .. I'm using a mongostore for storing my session, and I'm struggling a bit with the socket.io implementation .. i've looked around and found some usefull posts for getting the session ID from the cookie but it always returns false .. (code snippet: http://pastebin.com/meVpJKvM ). The cookie with a connect.sid value is present in my header when I log it, I just can't seem to do the connect.utils.parseSignedCookie , any clues?
