Hi there. I'm new to asynchronous serving and such, so I'm wondering if this is a really bad way to structure my server. I have a pretty typical structure, with a route function being carried out by a router module at the top level of my site. However, because I have different branches of my site, I'm planning on calling different route functions via subservient router modules, each of which will have a separate requestHandler module.
