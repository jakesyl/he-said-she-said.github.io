Beg: I mean that's cool and fun as a dev, but what I'm really asking is node a responsible choice to build small time customer websites with? A blog would seem better served with WordPress, but I guess blacksmith would be great too. But for a simple website, it still seems like RoR or Wordpress would be better. I *really* would prefer to use node, but what about the dev who comes after me and has to update their site or add new features?
