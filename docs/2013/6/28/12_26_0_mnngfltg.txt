Node beginner here. I want to write a simple utility script, using node.js, that performs some DB maintenance (i.e. executes some SQL commands). I run this script from the command line; it's not supposed to open any sockets. However, the DB api (sqlite for instance) is async. How do I write such a command-line utility?
