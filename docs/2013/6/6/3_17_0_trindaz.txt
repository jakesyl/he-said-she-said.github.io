Mongoose errors aren't "parsable" for meaningful messages back to the user AFAIK, and express-form makes you throw an error in custom validation functions to indicate that a field is not valid - which breaks when you have it inside a mongoose callback (I also tried using it with coalan/async to get outside my mongoose callback but that swallows errors!)
