I have NodeJS running behind NGINX in a reverse proxy configuration. A small hello world works as expected, but if I try to upload a file (settting the form's target to a iframe) the callback of "createServer" is called only when the file is uploaded, and I'd like to be able to see when the upload starts (said in another way, how can I make the "createServer" callback to fire when the upload starts)?
