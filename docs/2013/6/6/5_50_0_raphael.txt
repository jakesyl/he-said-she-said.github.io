guys, something I've been banging my head against: I'm using baucis in my app but it fails because it complains that the model it is supposed to use is not defined (the error message is 'MissingSchemaError: Schema hasn't been registered for model "Session"'). However if I log the content of mongoose.modelNames prior to calling baucis I can see that the mode is there.
