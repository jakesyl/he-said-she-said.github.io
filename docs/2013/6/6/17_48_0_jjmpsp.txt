Just trying to make sense of NodeJS... By looking at the docs I see http.createServer([requestListener]), but how am I meant to know which parameters I can use in the callback? By googling I can see sample code with the callback of function(request, response){} - Why isn't this in the docs? And where could I find this info rather than googling for sample code or logging objects in the console each time i write a line of code?
