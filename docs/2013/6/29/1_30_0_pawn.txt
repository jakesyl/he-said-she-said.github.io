If I use Nodemailer to send an email using a google apps account (or gmail), my email would first be sent to google's servers then google would send my email to whomever it's addressed to. If I set up postfix, my email will be sent directly to whom it's addressed to. Effectively, I'll be using the same amount of bandwidth in either case?
