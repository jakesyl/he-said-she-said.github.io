hi guys, I am new to node.js - I am having problems with  handling forms. I want to create a form that shows up when I go to localhost:3000/new. I have a ejs file with the form and I created a route for when the form posts the data to /create. However when I go to localhost:3000/new it says 404. Is there something I need to add to my app.js file to make it awarew of my new page?
