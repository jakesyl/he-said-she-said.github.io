any suggestions for me? - I started using node-amqp to help manage some firehouse-type data, and it's working fine, but now my tests for the e2e workflow fail (using mocha). Previously I had the benefit of returning a callback when my data has been (and using mocha's done()), but now the callback gets sent when messages are sent to the queue, so the tests fail b/c the messages haven't been read of the queue yet.
