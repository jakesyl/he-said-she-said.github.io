TooTallNate: i have a node-gyp question: I have an issue with the version of node-gyp that is in 0.10.7 ( and looks like 0.10.11 as well ) where build.js is failing because i have symlinked modules in node_modules I added a check in build.js (http://sprunge.us/DPSX) - but it looks like HEAD for node-gyp doesn't require this?
