ya, node's backend simply bindsthe socket.. if it crashes and you still can'tuse thatsocket, that's just a 'timeout'.. in C you'd use setsockopt SO_REUSEADDR etc.. so im assuming node already does that.. but simply binding to that port will 'lock' that socket because you can't bind to the same port again in another proess etc
