I'd like to set up a quick test environment on windows. I installed the node.js binary - works well. Now I'd like to connect to either a mysql server (locally) / mssql server (locally) or azure (remote) - can someone give me a hint on which library to use then please? (should just be a quick dev environment to try some things not for production use)
