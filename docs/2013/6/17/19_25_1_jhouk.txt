Hi folks, I'm new to the node.js ecosystem, trying to debug some code that is leveraging fs.stat().  I have tried to set up breakpoints in the callback when running the process in node-inspector but I haven't been able to get the process to return to the debugger after fs.stat() is called. It just terminates. Any suggestions?
