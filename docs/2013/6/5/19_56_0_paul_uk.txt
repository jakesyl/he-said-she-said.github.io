hey guys.  if i send an email.  am i able to determine where the user clicks/moves the mouse to if i serve a background image?  now i realise email clients don't allow js.  so is there anyway to determine this via node?  campaigncog.com says they have something in the works, but I'm having a hard time figuring out how they would do this
