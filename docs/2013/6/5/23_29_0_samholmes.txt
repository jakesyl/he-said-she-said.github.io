I have this idea for an open source node.js project: You install it, and it runs as a daemon. It's a P2P client that stores keys (a P2P database). Somehow, you earn credits from serving requests for specific keys, you can then use these credits to make requests. The more you computing power you give to the network the more computing power you can use.
