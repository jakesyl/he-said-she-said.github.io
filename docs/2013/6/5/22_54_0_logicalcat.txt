hi all, I fear I have painted myself into a corner. I have a filewalker that emits interesting stuff it finds to some worker classes to do all their stuff asynchronously. I need to know when all work is done, not just the walker (stuff happens long after it's done). I was comparing the walked files vs. worked-on files, but it is unreliable--fails about 20% of the time.
