mscdex: I'm messing around with node-chimera at the moment, trying to get a buffer back from a QPrinter, which only accepts a "filename" for output. I've set the result to /dev/stdout and it comes back on stdout - but is there a way I can write to something other than an actual file (without hitting disk i guess) so I can return a byte array?
