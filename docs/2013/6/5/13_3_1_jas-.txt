spectre: I hate recommending things like this as it subverts security implemented by the TLS/SSL certificate verification process but have you tried to set 'npm config set strict-ssl false' prior to installing any packages? Keep in mind that setting that value to false will require you to completely trust the npm package repo you are attempting to install from
