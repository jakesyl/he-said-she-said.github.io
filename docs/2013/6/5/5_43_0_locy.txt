im kinda new to node, im doing my head in trying to make a simple function to do an insert and return a last insert id if successful, i need to do multiple inserts and updates and require the insert ids for updates, ive found myself going though "callback hell" and not even getting anywhere, can someone show me an example of inserting then using the insertid in a update?
