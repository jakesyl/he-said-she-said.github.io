spectre: Yeah, couldn't think of all the package managers in use by the various linux distro's except those two =). Well do the 'make uninstall' then remove the source folder, then issue 'find / | grep npm' and manually issue 'rm -frv <Path/File>' for each entry (be careful here as you don't want to just delete everything only objects pertaining directly to the npm installation) then try it...
