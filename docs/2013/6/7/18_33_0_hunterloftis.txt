Hey everybody, I've recently had someone ask about connecting node.js with enterprise CMS systems. I'm giving them what little experience I have (mostly using node.js as a consumer of structured data exported from the CMS) but I'd love to share some good resources with them. Anybody got links or anecdotes for me?
