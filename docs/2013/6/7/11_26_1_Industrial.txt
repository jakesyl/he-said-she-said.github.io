Using mocha and chai.js, I am trying to rewrite my unit tests. I'm currently providing stub functions for assertions so I can keep all my test code using their assertions and slowly convert to the new assertion style. The problem I am having is that mocha is telling me tests are failing but if I zoom in on those tests / only execute those tests then they will pass
