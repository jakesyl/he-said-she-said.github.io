eliezerb: A basic calendar application. I've built the frontend with EmberJS and that's all fine with the FixtureAdapter/local storage. Now I'd like to build a REST API for it to consume. I know I should probably be looking at Restify to make my life easier, but I'm in this "for the long haul". I'd like to properly understand and learn NodeJS.
