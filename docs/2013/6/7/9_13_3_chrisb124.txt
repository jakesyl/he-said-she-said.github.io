I don't intend to have any user-specific interaction as such. i.e. they can't login or anything. For example, if I were building a blog, my API endpoint to get all posts might be GET http://mysite.com/posts. What I'm asking is, how can I make it will only return all posts to my frontend app, and a 403 to everyone else?
