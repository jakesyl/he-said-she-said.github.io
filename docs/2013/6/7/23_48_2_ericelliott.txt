ningu: Yes, Ruby is just slow in general. 1) it hasn't had the urgent optimization that was the result of the browser wars. 2) It has dynamic features that are harder to optimize than even JavaScript's. 3) Rails is a gigantic monolithic environment compared to Node. Lots more moving parts, and lots more to lift up on app start.
