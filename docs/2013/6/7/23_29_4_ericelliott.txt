sdwrage: For blogs, I recommend Wordpress/PHP. I still haven't seen a comparable solution for Node or Rails. For web applications in general, I've done a couple of rails -> node conversions (working on one now for Adobe). In my experience the before and after benefit in terms of performance and complexity reduction is pretty amazing.
