ericelliott: Makefiles are good whenever you need to do "Generate file X using these other resources" e.g. "Build thumbs-250px from source-images/*", anything else (running tests, etc) is best done with a shell script, though you can have a Makefile shortcut that runs such a script e.g. `make test` running `vows tests/test-*.js`
