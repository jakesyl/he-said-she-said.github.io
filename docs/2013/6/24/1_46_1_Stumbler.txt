So, every time I copy a node-webkit project from one mac to another, I get notified that it may be corrupt or incomplete, and can not be opened. everything is there, it's an uncompressed content folder... is there something really basic I'm missing about how mac applications are structured that would cause this? or is this a node-webkit specific problem?
