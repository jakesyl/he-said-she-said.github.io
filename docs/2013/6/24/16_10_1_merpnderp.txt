isaacbw: I've always had trouble managing large apps in languages that don't have nice IDE's. For python, perl, and javascript I've always just used VIM and been happy enough. But I've just started playing with Webstorm for JS and am in love. This is like have visual studios for JS. All sorts of code completion, declaration finding, code reformatting magic. Might solve the large scale code management problems for me.
