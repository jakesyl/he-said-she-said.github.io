Say I would want to create a (dnode) server that executes tasks (shell commands, node programs, maybe more kinds) at set intervals in time (so a job scheduler) or when events happend (to be specified by clients and initiated by them). Would you give every task/job an identifier? Would you store them in memory or in a database?
