Ah..I think i get it now.. The node program listens to shit on one or several ports, when something comes in to that port.. node starts a query from f.ex a database, and then the thread idles and 'waits' for it to finish.. When the query has finished, the OS says to Node: dude wake the fuck up shit is going down! And then Node runs the code in the callback function that you specified.. and then the OS says sleep now node... sleep!
