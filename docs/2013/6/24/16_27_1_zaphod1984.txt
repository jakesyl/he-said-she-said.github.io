bnoordhuis: i know it's evil, i just wanted to show my use case, the same applies for usage of domains. why would the uncaugt exception kill my server? the exception handler catches it and and shutting down the server (thus i can be sure that no other users are involved) i'm shutting down the process. afterwards it gets restarted.
