Skullclown: what are you trying to protect? technically if your trying to use some opaque symmetric encryption the key will be loaded into memory already due to high loads the applications need to decrypt prior to runtime. Because of this process if the server has been compromised the memory could easily be read providing the attacker easy access to decrypting the source for your node instance
