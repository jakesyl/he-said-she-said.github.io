child_process.exec spawns a shell (probably /bin/sh) and then runs the command line you asked for in that shell. child_process.execFile doesn't start a shell; it can avoid this because it makes you pass the arguments in as an array, so they don't need to be parsed apart by a shell. So this is handy in situations where you don't need shell features like globbing.
