I'm using Q, and I'd like to be able to skip some methods in the chain if the incoming request doesn't satisfy the requirements for my promisesâ€¦ for example I've got a user settings page where the user can upload an avatar (optionally), as well as change their name, email, password (all optional as well). If they change both their name, email, and upload an avatar, I'd like to only make one update call to the database
