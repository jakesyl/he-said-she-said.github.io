wondering, when using something like socket.io-clusterhub, assume you have two workers, from worker1 how can i manually access stored socket by worker2 ..? In single thread i was using io.sockets.sockets[socketId].. but this obviously skips the storage.. io.sockets.clients(); seems to do the trick .. how would you access it ?
