I need help to configure express.io with apache, my idea was to setup the proxy in apache to make it work https://domain.com and in the client script to write "var socket = io.connect('https://domain.com:3000');", it is working with some browsers but with others I have session problems handshake errors.... so I am kind of lost to configure it
