Is there any article/guide/tutorial/book/video/etc on the architecture of small communicating services? I wanna put seaport on action for me but I'm not sure I'm thining about this right; I'd have an authenticator, compiler, gazer(fs changes), logger, seaport and session-keeper server running along with a lot of website/http servers that would also consume these services e.g. recompile on fs changes
