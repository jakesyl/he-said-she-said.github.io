Last week I was discussing just using mongodb's native driver versus mongoose. I can't remember who it was but I wanted to ask them how they handled document column definitions in their db access code.  Just seems like everything you have to do would be easier if done with mongoose, from applying node-validator to keeping your module's document definition in sync with mongo's.
