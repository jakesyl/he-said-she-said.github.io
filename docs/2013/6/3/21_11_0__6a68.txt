olalonde: I guess my question was meant to get at (1) do you actually need relational stuff? if you need complex queries, ORMs tend to perform terribly. (2) if you don't need relational complexity (i.e. simple denormalized blobs work ok), maybe consider a simple data store and shift the query stuff higher in the stack. just probing why you both want complexity and want to hide complexity :-)
