lets say someone swipes a card and so Ive got their RFID code, I want to do something like ACLServer.authenticate(rfid, function() { /* Authenticated Successfully */ }, function() { /* Authentication failed */ }); or something like that. I'm just trying to figure out how to make this infrastructure work with mongo and node-control
