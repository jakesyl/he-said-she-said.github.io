So I'm trying to set up Browserify using https://github.com/andreypopp/connect-browserify to work on CoffeeScript sources (since apparently it works on CoffeeScript sources). Currently I'm getting an error on running the app about being "Unable to resolve or reject the same promise twice"; I suspect this error isn't really specific enough to troubleshoot effectively.
