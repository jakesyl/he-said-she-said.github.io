I want to build an multiplayer game over websockets which would feature a lobby where you can take seat positions to play another user in a head-to-head game. now, am i right in thinking that when you leave the lobby screen and go into a game (for example), the socket would be lost and then re-established with a new socket id if the game was to live on a separate page from the lobby?
