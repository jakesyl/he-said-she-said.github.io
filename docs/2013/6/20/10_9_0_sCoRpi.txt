did anybody have issues trying to stream an audio file from node to a user? It seems to work fine in chrome, firefox, ie and safari desktop, but on ios it just fails, reporting that the file cannot be played. Serving from a different server (apache for example) works fine. So i'm guessing it's a header issue
