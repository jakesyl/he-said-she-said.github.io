This may be the wrong place to ask this, but I am in the process of making an online game for fun (one of the many) and I'm doing some refactoring of what I have. I was wondering if there were any articles one may point me to that may help with approaching the Architecture of the app (not as much the game logic) for long time maintainability etc
