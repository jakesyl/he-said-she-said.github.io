hey guys ! I've got a question: Is there anyway to trigger a client side event from node? Like triggering a GET-Event? So at the moment I'm developing a cloud-service and I want to kick all users from a folder which has been deleted. So can I trigger a "refresh site" event? Oh god I don't know how to explain this well :/
