hi. can i ask for some help with a little trouble i have? I'm building a web scraper using jsdom and httpAgent. It's working nicely, andI get my data, but I eventually crash. apparently the web i'm scraping uses modernizr for feature detection, and I guess httpAgent or jsdom dont play nice with that.
