hi , how can i manage my packages to be installed locally e.g. the folder which i am using to develop not system wide. i created a package.json file inside that i have written dependencies:express latest but while i am doing npm install it show error to use it as sudo or root , my guess is if i run that as sudo it will install system wide isn't? how can i overcome this ?
