I'm using Express with routes, '/settings' matches 'settings.ejs'. I have an sqlite3 database with info in it and I want to display everything in the database on the settings page. How do I do this? For some reason, I can get my head around it. I know how to use the sqlite3 db.all() function but it's async, how do I get the output of db.all() to settings.ejs?
