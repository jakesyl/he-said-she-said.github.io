socket.io seems to be working and is connected (server triggers connected event + sends message) but the client just doesn't seem to receive anything. client just hangs until I stop the server (and it closes the socket) - when I do that, the client suddenly displays the "connected!" message, the "hello!" message and then some errors because it disconnected
