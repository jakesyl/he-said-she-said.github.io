Isnt it bad practice to distribute your node_modules folder around with you via your version control system and to deploy with it? Right now i don't, i simply rebuild it from my package.json when i deploy, but fluent-ffmpeg which is use says to put presets into node_modules/fluent-ffmpeg/lib/presets/, which would require me to distribute that around. Is there a way to get around this is a nice, clean way?
