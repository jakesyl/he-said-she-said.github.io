I would like to run these examples: http://socket.io/#how-to-use. I see there a "app.js" which has the code for the server program, but I dont know how to run that script "app.js". Until now I thought that javascript was intented only for client-side apps. Someone could tell how can i run these examples, please? Thanks.
