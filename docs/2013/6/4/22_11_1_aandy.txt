harbhub: in terms of interception, it's safe due to public/private key pairs. a private key can encrypt something which the public key can decrypt, a public key can encrypt something the private key can decrypt, but a public key can not encrypt (sign) something AS the private key. async information. so unless you replace the ssl certs with a valid pair (which may or may not be a "bad" CA forcefully trusted) that you own, no interception
