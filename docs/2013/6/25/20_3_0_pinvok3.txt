Well I wanted to write a tiny social network for learning purposes. My intention was to use PHP with laravel, but a friend told me to fuck off and said I should use node instead which is a good idea in my opinion.. But now I'm totally at 0 again and learn by doing it. I don't think this "network" will ever have much functionality. You can post stuff, people can be your friend, like your stuff.
