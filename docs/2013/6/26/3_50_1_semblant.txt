Hi all. I'm trying to set up an Arch Linux development machine and get node configured. I'm new to node, but to my knowledge I have followed the configuration steps as I understood them and believe I have the correct dependencies installed. When I run a simple http.js example I can't get a response back from node. Any ideas? I appreciate the help.
