what's the preferred way to use http api's? e.g. elasticsearch and titan. while they're on LAN, i still find it tedious that i *have* to use http (with the added overhead). am i the only one, or have others faced this dilemma aswel? i'm considering having a long idle connection pool (a reverse long pull if you will)
