adamvandenhoven: I'm using node-tap for testing. For what I'm working on, async.waterfall helps. I use function pairs in the waterfall to perform the tests. The first of each pair triggers something, using the async.waterfall callback as the callback. The next receives the callback, verifies the results, and then does a callback(null) to pass to the next pair.
