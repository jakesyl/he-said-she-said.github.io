TooTallNate: so on linux, when you use rpath in linker, it produces a library that knows about the right path to other used libraries.  for example, I'm linking to Qt, and on linux it is able to make use of rpath so that one doesn't have to export LD_LIBRARY_PATH if the libraries are installed in a different place
