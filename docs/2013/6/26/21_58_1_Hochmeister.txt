the problem is, in my real app (not the simplified example) I'm grouping by a url. Then in my JavaScript I'm building DOM elements using that _id value that comes back from the aggregation pipeline. However, I cannot decorate links and such with the url value (it also gets injected into the window.location.hash). I want to use some obfuscation here...
