Ok. let me backup. I just want to do "responsible" development in node (unit testing and running in VM to keep my local system out of the way). What I really need is a good up to date tutorial of what to start with. There is so many little bits and pieces out there its hard to know where to start (and a lot of stuff seems to have changed somewhat with recent vagrant releases)
