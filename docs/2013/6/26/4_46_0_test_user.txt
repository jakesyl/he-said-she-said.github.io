can anyone help me with a simple node.js problem? I'm using Cloud9 IDE and trying to test but it keeps giving me "TypeError: undefined is not a function" when trying to use the log function. I have log.js in my main directory and being required in the app via "var log = require("./log").log;  "  the log.js is from npmjs.org and I just moved it to the root of the app
