Can anyone explain to me if there is a way to make a global new connection so you don't have not call the CreateConnection method after every disconnection?  I was getting the "cannot enqueue after invoking quit" after googling the issue I came to the conclusion that you need to establish a new connection by calling the CreateConnection method after every disconnection. Is there a way around that to make a global connection
