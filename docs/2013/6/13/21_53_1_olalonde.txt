ningu: hey a neat feature of the orm im working on is that you'll be able to specify many adaptors. so for example for user model you could specify [ adapter.redis. adapter.pgsql ]. if the object is found in redis, it is returned, otherwise fallback to pgsql, etc. makes it easy to implement a cache layer. well, at least its a planned feature for now
