i'm having some difficulties with the bignum package on npm - i eventually got it installed manually since npm was having difficulty with it, but had to link it against my own  version of openssl, it seems to work until i try to actually call a method on a BigNumber object when node just silently dies. Has anybody actually got this package working? (Preferably on Windows)
