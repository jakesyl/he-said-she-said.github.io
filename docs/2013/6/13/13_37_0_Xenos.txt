I'm hoping this isn't too out of line, but may I possibly ask if anyone knows of a downloadable sample project that implements a working example of raw-socket or socket.io? I've been over the documentation again and again and I've come to the point where I am at a complete loss in understanding the way node.js works and how requirejs is correctly implemented.
