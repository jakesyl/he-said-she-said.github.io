I've been using soap-js to make SOAP calls to an https server and it was working, then I upgraded to v0.10.10 and now I'm getting some Error: read ECONNRESET at errnoException (net.js:884:11) at TCP.onread (net.js:539:19) 1 errors randomly. I'm pretty sure it is the same issue as https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/5360
