@nathan7 and @jas, I get modularity in node at that level, but for example at the web app level if you use something like Express, you may have a views folder with your views and perhaps a routes folder with your routes or whatever. when you app gets big, frameworks like python django encourage splitting up your code into "apps" like /app1/views and /app2/views instead of having 100 templates
