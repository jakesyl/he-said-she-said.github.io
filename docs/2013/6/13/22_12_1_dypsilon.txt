sinclair|net, don't get me wrong, i like design patterns, interfaces, models and so on, as much as the next developer but it's almost always an overengineering. I like to design small interconnected system nowadays and create HTTP based architectures. so my question is not how to maintain 5k classes, but how to maintain 200 rest services.
