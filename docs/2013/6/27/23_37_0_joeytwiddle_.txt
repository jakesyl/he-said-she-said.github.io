How do you feel about the pattern doSomething(params, onSuccess, onError); ?  This lets me re-use my error handling function in lots of places, and avoid if (error) {...} at the start of every callback.  I am actually thinking of wrapping a bunch of Node-style functions (in Mongoose, and other libs) to provide this interface instead...
