I mean if you are going to add that to your code to handle various types of uncaught exceptions, then clearly you are very likely to know what kind of issue triggers that uncaught exception and you can and would have already wrote your code to try and either resolve it or crash gracefully so that upstart or forever can re-run. I really do not understand the purpose of domains at all.
