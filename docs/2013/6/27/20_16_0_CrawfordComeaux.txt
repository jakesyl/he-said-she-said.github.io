I'm (re)writing a script that's meant to monitor me (ie. my phone usage, my location, and my current activities as reported by http://RescueTime.com), my calendar, and a schedule of daily routines I'm trying to develop. Basically, it needs to execute bits of code based on time (specific moments, intervals, and recurrences) and specific conditions. Is there some sort of scheduling lib/framework I should be using for this?
