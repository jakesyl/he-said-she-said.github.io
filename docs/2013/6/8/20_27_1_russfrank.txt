I upgraded to mountain lion and now node-gyp builds are failing, anyone know what I need to do to get this working? I added /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/ to my path but its still failing with stuff like " error: ‘NULL’ undeclared (first use in this function)" so II'm assuming this is a path issue..
