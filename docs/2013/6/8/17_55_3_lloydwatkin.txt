Hi all, I've got some weird issue going on with require() (potentially mocha).  When I require a module with a few exports.*** in code all is good. When I try and do this in a mocha test and console.log the return from require() I get an empty object.  This isn't nodejs version dependent (tried 0.8 -> 0.11). Other code whee I use module.exports is fine. Is there something about mocha I'm not aware of?
