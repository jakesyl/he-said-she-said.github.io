are there any npm gurus on? ive registered a package via npm but thinking it's maybe not needed now. It's really an application and ive always thought npm install means installing in node_modules whereas my app creates a node app with various folders and some dependencies.. I'm thinking my repo shouldnt be registered in npm because git clone is enough (and then npm install for deps). Am I right?
