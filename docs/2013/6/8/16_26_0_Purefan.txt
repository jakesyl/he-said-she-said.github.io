Hey guys! In an app with dozens or hundreds of clients I want to keep a log of calls to the DB, (hosting in Rackspace Databases and we dont get nice and cheap backups yet), I know I can use fs.appendFile but Im considering fs.appendFileSync instead worried that it would write invalid sql statements, what are your thoughts?
