hmz, I thought I needed promises but they are great in swallowing up errors and hiding failures, what is the benifit of promises compared to just firing events when things are done and catch them? my use case is parsing html, getting stylesheets, collecting images etc. so the code is doing a lot of requests, promises look pretty but when something goes wrong it is hard to find where (at least for me).
