1) I am using the plugin.  2) I can debug my node server.js file without a problem  3) I want to debug the client side javascript within the same progject and in all previous successfull client side debugs (not node with jade) I've had an html file to create the configuration file with webstorm 6.0  4) Since I'm using node with jade templates I don't have an html file to use for the configuration so I'm not sure what to do
