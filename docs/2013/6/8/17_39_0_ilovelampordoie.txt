node.js, what is the advantage of using node-http-proxy over asproxy? i know asproxy reroutes mot requests (not sure about websockets) but you use it just by going to a webpage. node-http-proxy you have to setup on the server and the client. why use node-http-proxy when you can just use asproxy and it is easier for the user?
