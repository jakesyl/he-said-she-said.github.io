if my app has 2 entry points, can "main" export them? might seem a stupid q but this app i have has 2 main entry points, i  understand {main:""} can be used, however if i install globally can i provide both exes? The configuration is local to the app, im sure that doesnt matter. What confuses me is when i do a local install it'll install the app in node_modules, is it just a case of making configuration external from global?
