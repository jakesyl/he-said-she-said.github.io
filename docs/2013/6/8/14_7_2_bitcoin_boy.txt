I am trying to find a way to encrypt this automatically and then decrypt it at runtime each time, knowing full well that it doesn't prevent somebody determined to get the code, but I still like the feeling of nobody being able to use their human eyes directly to read internal strings. Like the UPX packer for EXEs.
