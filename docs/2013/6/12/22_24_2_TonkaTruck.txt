Does anyone know if express automatically loads model instance when a route :id is found?  I don't get why the route /articles:id automatically has req.article loaded by the time it reaches the controller.  https://github.com/madhums/nodejs-express-mongoose-demo/blob/master/app/controllers/articles.js#L97
