hey all. i have an issue with a socket. I write a lot of data do it in a for loop (ie. same tick). If I send too much, i get the error. ECONNRESET. I tried queue up writes, and wait for the drain event when i received false from socket.write, but i still get ECONNRESET. does anyone know how to throttle the writes so i dont get this error? or is throttling not the solution?
