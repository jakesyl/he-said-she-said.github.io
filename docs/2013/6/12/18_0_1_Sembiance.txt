heh. there has been this daddy long-legs spider hanging out in my bathroom the past several weeks. always in the same spot, totally motionless. Today I found an ant upstairs, so I decided to drop the ant into the web the spider was hanging out on. as soon as that ant hit that web, that spider bolted towards it and started spinning it up. Pretty cool :)
