hi there, does anyone know why when I add the loine app.use(expressValidator);  //required for Express-Validator to the app.js. as outlined in the example http://blog.ijasoneverett.com/2013/04/form-validation-in-node-js-with-express-validator/ that when going to the main root page or any page the vrowser shows a never ending load of the page?
