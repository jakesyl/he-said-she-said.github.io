00:00 < Jianju> May I ask someone a simple question?
00:00 <@mbalho> you can ask everyone and someone might answer
00:00 < Jianju> Can I run a locally hosted server under Windows 8?
00:00 < Zak> for nodejs?
00:00 < Jianju> For experiemntation..
00:00 < Jianju> Yeah, a node.js server
00:01 < Jianju> Trying to figure out if it's right for my project.
00:01 < Zak> Sure. If you want it to be accessible beyond localhost, make sure you set a proper bind address and expose the relevant ports through your firewall
00:01 < Zak> e.g. listen(9004, "0.0.0.0")
00:01 < Jianju> I see. Thanks!
00:02 < Jianju> And I can interact with a locally running C++ application as well? Through a socket layer?
00:02 < Zak> Sure. the nodejs could connect with your C++ application in many ways
00:02 < Zak> http, websockets, https, etc
00:03 < Jianju> Thanks, Zak. Very helpful.
00:03 < Zak> there's even ways to use C libraries directly in nodejs!
00:03 < Zak> although i haven't done that personally
00:03 < Jianju> Yeah, I noticed something about extensions in C/C++
00:04 < Zak> http://nodejs.org/api/addons.html
00:04 < Zak> useful if you really want to run something optimized
00:04 < Zak> so there's really no excuse for not using nodejs :D
00:05 < Jianju> Yeah, I want to run some complex code & interact with it via node.js
00:16 < mscdex> node.js rules!
00:18 < misterhat> ya mscdex
00:18  * superjoe high fives mscdex

00:20 < SrPx> How do you deliver a node.js site to a client?
00:21 < SrPx> Are you supposed to say 'take this folder, install node.js, run that command on command line and your site will be online!'? 
00:21 < niggler> SrPx s/folder/tarball
00:22 < niggler> package.json helps you with the node dependencies
00:22 < SrPx> niggler: please elaborate ?
00:22 < SrPx> No idea what you are talking about
00:23 < niggler> you compress the stuff into a tarball or zip file or whatever
00:23 < Leo> Is there anyway to "share" variable in javascript? Like declaring header files in C.. Like importing a class in php and declaring its properties public.
00:23 < niggler> then you extract it on the server and run
00:23 < Leo> should i exports a object?
00:24 < niggler> the package.json format lets you specify dependencies and a start script
00:24 < SrPx> niggler: But that's not the question. How do I deliver my 'node.js site', without having the client to install node.js himself, and have to run my site typing a command line command, which he will not want to ?
00:24 < chilts> SrPx: host it somewhere. <yourclient>.<yourdomain>.com :)
00:24 < chilts> or something like that
00:25 < chilts> and then just send them the code if they really want it, or a pointer to your repo
00:25 < SrPx> chilts: I... don't want to pay for his traffic
00:25 < niggler> use nodejitsu
00:25 < SrPx> hmm
00:25 < niggler> or some other service that they can pay for
00:25 < SrPx> So wait, there is not a standard way to deliver a node.js solution? 
00:25 < niggler> how do you deliver a php solution?
00:26 < niggler> you send a tarball or whatever and they extract somewhere, making sure that they have the right versions of apache and php installed
00:26 < niggler> you face the same exact problem
00:28 < Zak> the standard way to deliver a node.js solution is to use npm
00:29 < niggler> Zak SrPx is complaining about having someone install nodejs
00:29 < Zak> if you use node.js in collaboration with anything else, then it's not standard, so you'll need a non-standard installer
00:29 < Zak> niggler: understand
00:30 < CoL_Centruion> hello
00:30 < Zak> installers are a burden in general
00:30 < Zak> you'll find that there are very few "easy" installations
00:30 < SrPx> Hmm I see
00:31 < Zak> it really depends on what you classify as your customer/client
00:31 < SrPx> niggler: that's true...
00:31 < CoL_Centruion> anyone expert with node.js? got a few questions
00:31 < SrPx> maybe the problem is that everyone knows how to put some files inside  of a public_html folder or something and voila
00:31 < Zak> if its an administrator, just provide documentation on how to set your application up and forget about installers
00:31 < Zak> CoL_Centruion: just ask
00:31 < Zak> don't ask to ask
00:31 < niggler> the simplest way SrPx is to set up a package.json
00:31 < SrPx> Zak: but can I ask to ask to ask?
00:32 < CoL_Centruion> I wanna know how to run an apache server and send a https request to node
00:32 < niggler> SrPx http://package.json.nodejitsu.com/
00:32 < Zak> SrPx: no, that's ask-ception and that would just be stupid
00:32 < SrPx> like: hey guys im new to node.js, but i'm not sure if you allow questions, but some people complained on the other channel because I asked to ask. So can I ask to ask?
00:32 < Zak> CoL_Centruion: send or proxy?
00:32 < superjoe> wat
00:32 < superjoe> oh good he's joking
00:33 < SrPx> niggler: hm
00:33 < CoL_Centruion> send? what do you mean by proxy
00:33 < Zak> CoL_Centruion: node would receive https or http as it would normally
00:34 < Zak> whatever traffic you divert, or whatever https requests you make from apache would need to be configured correctly
00:34 < Zak> this is really more of an apache question than a node one tbh
00:34 < CoL_Centruion> how do you make it recieve https?
00:34 < niggler> so SrPx you see in the sample there's a "scripts" field -- stick a "start" command there and magic happens
00:34 < SrPx> reading wait
00:34 < Zak> CoL_Centruion: var https = require("https"); 
00:34 < CoL_Centruion> yeah i read that but where does it go
00:35 < Zak> in the javascript which node runs, where-ever that is
00:35 < CoL_Centruion> on apps.js
00:35 < SrPx> Still not sure how that works
00:35 < CoL_Centruion> Let me explain  you situation more clearly
00:35 < CoL_Centruion> *situation 
00:36 < Zak> CoL_Centruion: simple example in docs here: http://nodejs.org/api/https.html
00:36 < CoL_Centruion> yes i read that but im baffled on where to add that code
00:36 < Zak> how are you running your node program?
00:37 < Zak> if you stick the sample code into something like "sample.js", you would just run it like "node sample.js"
00:37 < Zak> then it begins listening for HTTPS traffic on port 8000
00:37 < Zak> provided you've also provided it the key and cert properly
00:37 < Zak> node runs programs you write
00:38 < Zak> if you run node without supplying a program to it, it runs in a REPL mode more or less
00:38 < Zak> node doesn't just run by itself, it's not a matter of "turning on HTTPS". You need to write something that serves HTTPS, then you run it via node.
00:39 < Zak> how you manage that via apache, I have no idea... but that's a question you can ask in another place
00:41 < CoL_Centruion> basically this is my setup i have an apache server running using ssl on port 443, i then generated an ssl cert using mod sll. Then i uploaded my node application with the that contains the node.js and a html website. I also added mongodb that runs in 2071 that connects to node.js . i can get my code and webapplication to submit when using standard http request but whenever i try using the html file through https i can acces th
00:42 < zoned>  i keep getting this when trying to start mongodb, can anyone help?    Error: couldn't connect to server 127.0.0.1:27017 src/mongo/shell/mongo.js:91 exception: connect failed
00:42 < CoL_Centruion> that node js is not handling the request because its in https and i suppose that the information that i sending to node.js is encrypted so it does not succesfully update the database
00:43 < CoL_Centruion> basically it does not run the script when i hit the submit button this only happens when i acces it throught http though
00:43 < CoL_Centruion> Thanks by the way
00:43 < Zak> so are you saying that you have nodejs running alongside apache?
00:43 < Zak> and when you hit submit, you're redirecting the user to the node's url?
00:44 < bb6346> still trying to get a handle on node. Am i correct in saying that the way to build non-blocking code is to pass data through nested functions? Callbacks if you will?
00:45 < CoL_Centruion> zak yes i am running nodejs alongside apache
00:46 < CoL_Centruion> are you suggesting that i do not need apache at all?
00:47 < CoL_Centruion> and i can run it all throught node apps.js?
00:47 < CoL_Centruion> i just have to make node.js support the ssl certificate i made?
00:49 < s5fs> CoL_Centruion: I can post an example of an http/https server in node.js/connect if you're interested. it's really small.
00:49 < warz> CoL_Centruion, correct.
00:49 < s5fs> CoL_Centruion: i'm working on an embedded project and we've dropped lighttpd in favor of node for our web server process.
00:51 < mscdex> SrPx: you can always bundle node binaries i guess, as long as you know their target platform?
00:51 < SrPx> I'm not suree
00:52 < SrPx> That's becoming too complicated. All I needed node.js for was handling some requests without needing to write php code
00:52 < SrPx> But I guess my client will prefer if I do
00:53 < CoL_Centruion> s5fs can you send me your small example?
00:54 < s5fs> CoL_Centruion: here you go: http://pastie.org/5491430
00:55 < s5fs> CoL_Centruion: That should be a fully-functional static web server. delete the "require('./chat.js')" business, that's not needed for you (includes a little socket.io server)
00:56 < s5fs> woo, i removed it myself! /pats own back
01:35 < Moult> hey all, i haven't touched frontend in a while and apparently nodejs has been the popular kid on the block for a while now. where would you recommend to start learning it?
01:40 < mdedetrich> yo bitches
01:40 < dnz-> LISTEN
01:40 < mdedetrich> Moult: what kind of answer are you looking for
01:40 < dnz-> THAT IS NOT APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR
01:40 < dnz-> FOR THIS CHANNEL
01:40 < dnz-> U WILL BE +KB
01:40 < mdedetrich> dnz-: you spanking my ass is not appropriate mate
01:40 < dnz-> lel
01:40  * Sly gets paddle.
01:40 < Sly> I must be very inappropriate, then.
01:40 < mdedetrich> oh dude
01:40 < dnz-> deoxxa:
01:40 < mdedetrich> dont get my started
01:40 < dnz-> deoxxa: ping and shit
01:40 < dnz-> deoxxa: 
01:41 < dnz-> ping some more asshat
01:41 < mdedetrich> Moult: if you want to learn node.js for the reasons that node.js is so strong
01:41 < mdedetrich> Moult: look at express and socket.io
01:41 < mdedetrich> Moult: or something like SS which is what I use
01:41 < Sly> mdedetrich: I want to get you started. Bend over. ;D
01:41 < mdedetrich> how typical
01:43 < Moult> mdedetrich: well, any links to recommended resources for a newcomer to nodejs
01:43 < mdedetrich> Moult: where did you come from
01:43 < Moult> mdedetrich: hmm, don't understand the question?
01:43 < mdedetrich> Moult: what language frontend
01:43 < mdedetrich> and backend
01:43 < _numbers> i just made a pure-javascript cross-browser-compatible stand-alone in-browser integration tester with mocha+chai+iframes. anyone interested?
01:43 < mdedetrich> or is this is the first time you started webdev
01:44 < _numbers> it doesnt use selenium
01:44 < _numbers> and it can test the state of the browser and js
01:44 < asadpakistani1> If I am to have an application where my Rest API can modify both a database locally and a database on the cloud...and then the two Sync themselves...Which would be a better data store for such a problem...MongoDB or couchDB?
01:44 < Moult> mdedetrich: i normally code PHP backend, but i do know the usual HTML/CSS/JS(+Jquery) combo.
01:44 < mdedetrich> ok thats better
01:44 < mdedetrich> Moult: so first thing, the main strength of node.js compared to every other language
01:45 < mdedetrich> Moult: is that its non blocking, this means that when a request is made to a node.js server, the server will just 'queue' that request, the server will be halted until the request is finished
01:45 < mdedetrich> Moult: node.js is the ONLY language where basically the entire ecosystem is designed to be non blocking
01:45 < mdedetrich> Moult: so the first thing you need to understand is the async call patterns that you see in node.js and its libraries
01:46 < mdedetrich> Moult: if you are familiar with javascript you will understand callbacks, well its the same thing as node.js backend
01:46 < mdedetrich> every callback has the pattern function(err,result)
01:46 < mdedetrich> that is asynchronous
01:47 < mdedetrich> if you are coming from PHP, you also need to learn, that node.js is more of a proper programming language with modules unlike PHP
01:48 < mdedetrich> so using google, this is what oyu kinda need to learn
01:49 < mdedetrich> Moult: http://www.nodebeginner.org/
01:49 < mdedetrich> thats what you should probably learn to get a good background
01:50 < Moult> mdedetrich: cheers :) sounds good. thanks very much, i'll take a look at it.
01:53 < deplifer> quick question around Buffer when having extended bytes how does one glue extended bytes in a buffer 
01:54 < deplifer> say i have new Buffer("Å") => which gives me a total length of 2, where i would have to glue bytes[0] + bytes[1] in some way to get the correct character
01:54 < mdedetrich> Moult: you also need to learn, that unlike PHP, node.js is a proper programming language
01:54 < mdedetrich> Moult: with modules and whatnot
01:55 <@Nexxy> as proper as you can get with javascript
01:55 < Sly> Nexxy <3
01:55 < mdedetrich> well yeah
01:55 < mdedetrich> well we have modules now
01:55 <@Nexxy> Sly, <3
01:55 < mdedetrich> *high 5*
01:55 < Moult> mdedetrich: i understand, just becaues i code PHP doesn't mean I don't understand good code architecture, and alternative language structures
01:55 < Sly> Nexxy: if pre-order is missed, when is the next batch?
01:55 < Sly> jw.
01:56 <@Nexxy> I will find out :)
01:56 < Sly> Thanks. :D
01:57 < mdedetrich> also, does async work fine in browsers?
01:57 < mdedetrich> when used through browserverify
01:57 <@Nexxy> yes
01:57 < mdedetrich> (im talking about the npm library)
01:58 <@Nexxy> caolan's async?
01:58 < mdedetrich> yup
01:58 <@Nexxy> I do believ so yes
01:58 <@Nexxy> jerrysv, !
01:59 < jerrysv> Nexxy: what's up?
01:59 < mdedetrich> his penis?
01:59 -!- mdedetrich was kicked from #Node.js by Nexxy [mdedetrich]
01:59 < mscdex> Nexxy, \o/
01:59 <@Nexxy> \o/
02:00 <@Nexxy> jerrysv, just excited for SF
02:00  * jerrysv is sorting and packing hardware!!!
02:00 < jerrysv> Nexxy: me too :)
02:00 <@Nexxy> ugh!
02:00 <@Nexxy> my amazon order hasn't come in yet ;<
02:01 <@Nexxy> I only got the lasers so far
02:01 < jerrysv> my gps won't show up until saturday, so i'm going to build an oscilloscope instead so i can try to get my proximity sensors working
02:01 <@Nexxy> ohh
02:01 < mscdex> deplifer: you can use .toString() with a built-in encoding, if utf8/etc doesn't work for you, then you may need to use node-iconv with your Buffer
02:01 <@Nexxy> that reminds me
02:01 <@Nexxy> do you have any recommendation on a logic analyzer?
02:02 < jerrysv> nope - which is why i'm building a scope
02:02 <@Nexxy> hah
02:02 <@Nexxy> I found one with good reviews on amazon for 150
02:02 <@Nexxy> 8 channels
02:02 < deplifer> mscdex: yes i know ican do buf.toString(null, pos, 2) and i would get the correct character also, just want to do know how todo the conversion manually 
02:03 < jerrysv> will bring a dmm though, laurie gave me one of hers because mine died
02:03 < mscdex> well, you wouldn't pass in null heh
02:03 <@Nexxy> jerrysv, ya I am bringing one and I believe there will be a few @ hard hack as well
02:03 < deplifer> mscdex: you can pass in null, encoding defaults to utf8
02:03 < deplifer> if so
02:03 < mscdex> deplifer: doing the conversion manually requires knowledge of the encoding you want
02:03 < jerrysv> Nexxy: figured as much, but better safe than sorry. going through security might be entertaining :)
02:04 <@Nexxy> haha yeah
02:04 < jerrysv> bringing maybe 10 usb to uart adapters too
02:04 < jerrysv> "sir? may i ask you what's in the bag?", "why yes, it's a bag full of awesome!"
02:05 <@Nexxy> and rainbows
02:05 < jerrysv> gah. accidentally got 33ohm resistors instead of 22's. oh well.
02:06 <@Nexxy> I have an assortment
02:06 <@Nexxy> there should be moar there too
02:06 < deplifer> yup on utf8 encoding any insights, just asking quick if anybody knows should be some masking if some sort like bytes[0] + (bytes[1] >> mask) something like that well will find out eventually…
02:06 < mscdex> deplifer: there's also string_decoder
02:06 < mscdex> deplifer: nitty gritty description: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utf8#Description
02:07 < deplifer> thanks mscdex why did i not think of wikipedia… is there something like mscdex++
02:08  * mscdex cannot tell if being sarcastic over the internet ...
02:08 < asadpakistani1> What is a good repository that always has the latest stable version of couch db?
02:08 < jerrysv> Nexxy: i'm not too worried, it's just for voltage protection for the scope i'm building. doesn't have to be exact
02:09 < deplifer> mscdex: was more lie awarding you a point for the help, been to other chat rooms where they have reward systems
02:09 < deplifer> like
02:09 < mscdex> heh
02:10 < mscdex> don't need any rewards here :-)
02:17 < Raynos> Anyone familiar with debugging CPU usage
02:18 < Raynos> I have a flame graph that shows CPU usage looks like https://gist.github.com/bfc61c25e1a7825b6739
02:18 < Raynos> Which means one of my servers is going absolutely crazy
02:18 < Raynos> like: http://imgur.com/40aju even
02:20 < cleos_frey> in mongoose, what's a good hoook to use where I could send a "authenticate this account" email
02:20 < cleos_frey> the 'save' and 'init' hooks trigger too often
02:21 < cleos_frey> maybe I could use a instance method...

02:22 < switz> hey, what do you guys think of my side project? http://phishvids.com
02:23 < bakadesu> sounds phishy
02:24 < switz> yeah, I wouldn't visit it if I were you.
02:24 < cleos_frey> yeah it just redirects to zombo.com
02:24 < cleos_frey> had to restart my comp 3-times
02:26 < Zak> hey substack. Are you awake?
02:43 < jerrysv> Nexxy: given that i want to also hit my favorite SF beer shop, i am packing an unopened pack of beer.js stickers courtesy of voodootikigod
02:47 < Zak> has anybody had much luck getting testling working locally?
02:47 <@Nexxy> jerrysv, faaancy
02:47 < Zak> i've found a number of bugs but i've just stumbled across the main chunk of code which runs the test on the browser locally and i'm a little stumped
02:47 <@Nexxy> jerrysv, I have a pack of CascadiaJS stickers ;o
02:50 < jerrysv> Nexxy: i wasn't going to bring those :)
03:30 < DaMorpheuS> <DaMorpheuS> hey guys I have a problem... I have an api build in node and when I send a authorisation request through a post the api returns a set-cookie in the header. that's what i want but the cookie isn;t stored and i don't know why
03:34 < DaMorpheuS> no one!
03:40 < deoxxa> DaMorpheuS: i've actually got no idea what you're asking
03:40 < deoxxa> DaMorpheuS: are you making an http request? or are you running an http server? or something entirely different?
03:43 < DaMorpheuS> I have a http server created in node. and i have a emberjs front end which i use to do a http request to the server
03:44 < DaMorpheuS> this returns a json and a cookie but for some reason my session cookie isn't stored on the client-side
03:44 < DaMorpheuS> so the authorisation won't work
03:45 < DaMorpheuS> it worked fine when I used the routing of node to create a front end but because of the wished we have in the frontend we want to see if ember is an option
03:46 < Zak> use the browser and inspect the requests
03:47 < Zak> then you can clarify your statement "my session cookie isn't stored on the client-side" 
03:52 < DaMorpheuS> well if I take a look in the response header of my request it says that there is a session cookie set for the site but in chrome if I look to the recourses of my site there is no cookie set at all
03:53 < DaMorpheuS> Access-Control-Allow-Headers:Content-Type
03:53 < DaMorpheuS> Access-Control-Allow-Origin:*
03:53 < DaMorpheuS> Connection:keep-alive
03:53 < DaMorpheuS> Content-Length:118
03:53 < DaMorpheuS> Content-Type:application/json
03:53 < DaMorpheuS> Set-Cookie:connect.sid=s%3AOjvQ1y1clkf7F3lcyR51P06y.8tA2ugP5lTaDLjUCv8zCYCk6DGX7rAfI6nFuiVOs9hc; Path=/; Expires=Sat, 08 Dec 2012 03:50:46 GMT; HttpOnly
03:53 < DaMorpheuS> X-Powered-By:Express
03:55 < DaMorpheuS> this are my response header for a post to my api that handles the authorisation on the backend and returns a json with the user information and creates a session in my session store on the server
03:55 < DaMorpheuS> but without the session cookie this is useless :(
03:58 < DaMorpheuS> zak is this information you can help me with?
04:00 < Zak> you're aware that cookies are specific to certain hosts and ports right?
04:00 < Zak> and the protocol too
04:01 < Zak> so if you're redirecting to a different port/host/protocol, you won't get the cookie
04:01 < Zak> well, not of your original site anyway
04:02 < Zak> if it worked before when you were doing routing, then the host/protocol/port would have been the same probably
04:03 < DaMorpheuS> can I fix that
04:03 < DaMorpheuS> because the thing is that my server and client are going to be two seperate instances
04:03 < DaMorpheuS> so can be 2 completly difference urls domains/ports

06:13 < fotoflo> anyone in bejing? looking to recruit here...
06:14 < Coolrebel> Ha! <Lorentz>
06:14 < Coolrebel> How do you reply to a specific person on this thingy?
06:14 < Lorentz> Coolrebel: like so
06:14 < prishabh> you could PM me
06:15 < Coolrebel> I pressed the wrong button
06:16 < Coolrebel> Thank you, all. I'll be back when peeps isn't in the pub. 
07:05 < pppaul> i'm doing DI with nodejs vis symlinks
07:05 < pppaul> wanna fight about it?
07:07 < RLa> di?
07:14 < pppaul> dependancy injection
07:14 < skiddy> anyone aware of a javascript test lib that can simulate a click and drag e.g. on a jquery ui draggable 
07:14 < pppaul> #jqueru
07:14 < pppaul> #jquery
07:20 < skiddy> ah syn.js
07:22 < jsilver> https://gist.github.com/6cc95fb984c56c8188fa
07:22 < jsilver> what happened
07:46 < fotoflo> hey all, I'm running the debugger with nodev on OSX. … is there a way to get the inspector to refresh the socket connection whenever the server is restarted?
08:05 < DaMorpheuS> can someone help me out with session cookies and passport
08:09 < py_> if anyone write a java client in android to connect socket.io ?
08:10 < py_> anyone?
08:10 < SomeoneWeird> wat
08:11 < py_> I find a lot client in github, but they all seem not work.
08:12 < SomeoneWeird> maybe ask in the socketio channel
08:12 < RLa> maybe the problem is somewhere else
08:12 < SomeoneWeird> >.>
08:14 < deoxxa> sorry mario, the princess is in another castle!
08:14 < felixge> mscdex: I stole the package name? :)
08:15 < felixge> what package where you talking about
08:15 < felixge> ?
08:19 < deoxxa> felixge: you stole all the package names!
08:19 < felixge> deoxxa: :D
08:19 < felixge> tell that to substack
08:20 < switz> haha
08:20 < felixge> my packages have at least more than 10 lines of code
08:20 < felixge> so some of them are useful
08:20 < felixge> *g*
08:20 < felixge> *troll*
08:20 < felixge> :)
08:20 < switz> lmao
08:21 < switz> how do I take my node skills to the next level? any advice?
08:22 < SomeoneWeird> lmao
08:22 < SomeoneWeird> switz, switz[skill]++;
08:22 < switz> oh ty
08:22 < RLa> what level you are atm
08:22 < switz> 4
08:22 < SomeoneWeird> console.log(switz[skill]);
08:23 < switz> haha, I'm fairly comfortable with node and javascript. Looking to learn some of the more advanced parts of node.
08:23 < SomeoneWeird> uvbook?
08:23 < SomeoneWeird> idno probably not
08:24 < deoxxa> switz: [" a ", " b "].map(Function.prototype.call.bind("".trim)); // explain what this does and how it works
08:24 < SomeoneWeird> i don't even know what that does u freak
08:24 < deoxxa> switz: i expect an answer before the next equinox!
08:25 < bnoordhuis> switz: read the node source code?
08:25 < SomeoneWeird> jks i just dunno how it works >.>
08:25 < switz> it returns
08:25 < ljharb> deoxxa: it trims all the things in the array, in a crazy way
08:25 < switz> ["a","b"]
08:25 < deoxxa> ljharb: partial credit
08:25 < ljharb> deoxxa: [' a ', ' b '].map(function (str) { return str.trim(); }) is much simpler
08:25 < SomeoneWeird> BUT MOAR CHARS
08:25 < switz> haha
08:26 < ljharb> why partial credit, for recognizing a bs way to do something?
08:26 < ljharb> :-p
08:26 < deoxxa> just because it's bs doesn't mean it isn't interesting! :<
08:26 < deoxxa> also, explain why it's slow
08:26 < deoxxa> (because it is)
08:26 < deoxxa> hint: it's not .bind
08:26 < ljharb> because binding creates another anon function, which is a big one
08:26 < SomeoneWeird> bcuz u
08:26 < switz> check out my node app, let me know what sucks. http://phishvids.com
08:27 < ljharb> deoxxa: is it still slow if you bind to String.prototype.trim instead of ''.trim?
08:27 < deoxxa> yep
08:27 < ljharb> oh
08:27 < deoxxa> heh
08:27 < deoxxa> ding!
08:27 < geekie> dong!
08:27 < deoxxa> the witch is dead
08:27 < ljharb> the map iterator receives 3 callbacks, and function.prototype.call passes them all through?
08:28 < deoxxa> can you clarify that? you're on the right track
08:29 < ljharb> Function.prototype.call.bind(trim) creates an anon function that in turn reads from all the passed in arguments, so maybe it keeps a closure reference to the args (including the full array) longer, or something?
08:29 < ljharb> i'm not sure, this is crazy town
08:29 < DaMorpheuS> I have a session issue on a cross domain setup anyone can help me with this!??
08:29 < deoxxa> so close
08:30 < SomeoneWeird> its ok nobody needs to know except deoxxa 
08:30 < SomeoneWeird> hes crazy
08:30 < deoxxa> it's actually the .call() that's slow - it does nearly all the same work as .bind() except that it returns the result rather than a function reference
08:30 < deoxxa> so you're doing "".trim.call(" a ") and "".trim.call(" b ")
08:31 < deoxxa> (and any other contents of the array)
08:31 < SomeoneWeird> weird
08:31 < deoxxa> it's clearer if you write it like [" a ", " b "].map("".trim.call.bind("".trim))
08:32 < deoxxa> but since "".trim instanceof Function, "".trim.call === Function.call
08:32 < deoxxa> and this concludes "the most complicated and potentially useless thing i know about javascript"
08:32 < ljharb> lol
08:33 < ljharb> if that's the most complicated and useless thing you know, you should learn more about JS
08:33 < deoxxa> i'm working on it!
08:33 < ljharb> :-)
08:34 < switz> who has more javascript trivia for me?
08:35 < ljharb> why is Math.pow(2, 53) === Math.pow(2, 53) + 1
08:36 < SomeoneWeird> wtfjs.com
08:37 < DaMorpheuS> guys I have some troubles with my session cookies I need for authentication to my backend. problem is to do with cross domain setup any leeds for me
08:38 < DaMorpheuS> shit making me crazy :)
08:38 < geekie> =)
08:38 < bnoordhuis> switz: another one, why is 1 << 31 == -2147483648 and 1 << 32 == 1?
08:39 < ljharb> DaMorpheuS: you can't read cookies across domains
08:39 < switz> ahh I don't know bitshifting in javascript
08:39 < DaMorpheuS> ok yes I get that but this is my setup I have a json api written in node
08:40 < DaMorpheuS> and a frontend written in ember and i want the client to authenticate on the api server
08:40 < [AD]Turbo> hola
08:40 < DaMorpheuS> but the cookie is never set due to crossdomain
08:40 < ljharb> DaMorpheuS: right - so you can't do that. you'd have to share a session key between your backend webserver and your api server
08:40 < Industrial> Should I use the delete keyword to remove an object property or just use .filter() to create a new one without the property?
08:40 < ljharb> DaMorpheuS: you simply can't treat the browser like it's a native app
08:41 < ljharb> Industrial: neither. just null it.
08:41 < switz> hmm, are there any sites that are reverse of most coding testing sites? they show you code and you have to give them back what it would return without writing anything?
08:41 < switz> without writing any code yourself*
08:41 < ljharb> Industrial: using "delete" deoptimizes the entire object
08:41 < DaMorpheuS> so I have to send my session key in every request?
08:41 < Industrial> ljharb: null or undefined =)
08:41 < ljharb> DaMorpheuS: well yeah, that's what a cookie would be doing anyways
08:42 < DaMorpheuS> can i just send it in the header or do i have to add it to the data of the request
08:42 < ljharb> that depends on your api server
08:42 < ljharb> DaMorpheuS: but trying to pretend like you can run an entire app without logic on your webserver is just all bad news bears.
08:44 < DaMorpheuS> well what i can do I think is save the session id in the local session store itself and use it from there i think
08:44 < ljharb> just authenticate with your webserver, and let that communicate with the api on the backend.
08:45 < ljharb> the browser is not a native app.
08:48 < DaMorpheuS> ok i get that but the problem with that is that the backend is responsable for authentication and ginving away the rights to it's data so how to let the webserver check this on the backend
08:53 < ljharb> the webserver authenticates to the api server, the webserver authenticates to the browser, and all api traffic is funneled through the webserver

09:56 < squeakytoy> boss approved me doing a tech-talk about node.js next friday.. its going to be awweessoommmeee
09:58 < deoxxa> squeakytoy: neat!
10:19 < pixie79> hi all, i am just trying to gets the results of a system command printed to console.log and I believe I have followed the examples correctly but dont seem to be getting any results - can someone please offer some guidence. https://gist.github.com/4232311
10:23 < RLa> pixie79, also incude stderr output
10:23 < RLa> maybe the command just fails
10:23 < deoxxa> pixie79: you're... you're logging the string "data".
10:25 < pixie79> at the moment i am getting nothing on console.log, the command works fine on the cli - but i will try logging err as well
10:26 < pixie79> interesting logging STDERR gives me a buffer printed
10:41 < radiodario> What's your favorite node app demonizator? forever?
10:44 < swords> I've been programming in javascript for over 10 years, but some parts where still not obvious for me, so I've spend the last month reading about patterns, closures, scoping and inheritance. Which has been a good spend time. But now I'm trying to actually use them and I'm lost once again. What I'm trying to do is on page where I use a widget that contains eight buttons, which contain images, masks and labels I like to export them and still 
10:44 < swords> maintain DRY. So after some thinking I thought it would make sense to use exports + facade (provide just the buttons with the contained mask/image/labels) + inheritance (create 8 instances of button). But how the …. do I combine these patterns? Does anyone have a example?
10:46 < Kudos> swords: ##javascript is probably a better place for that question
10:47 < swords> Kudos, thanks, I'll ask it there.
10:48 < swords> And you're right, it's more javascript in general then node specific.
10:50 < deoxxa> radiodario: i find including coffeescript in an app makes it pretty demonic
10:51 < radiodario> deoxxa: i didn't mention coffeescript
10:51 < radiodario> ?
10:51 < deoxxa> you did mention demons though :P
10:51 < radiodario> like, daemon
10:51 < radiodario> ah a joke
10:51  * radiodario hasn't had coffee yet
10:51 < deoxxa> heh
10:51 < deoxxa> more usefully, yes, i use forever
10:51 < deoxxa> i find it's pretty ok
10:52 < radiodario> sweet
10:52 < deoxxa> it'll be a pain once i need to monitor/log process information externally
10:52 < deoxxa> but for a simple "get it running" thing, it does alright
10:52 < radiodario> okay
10:54 < RLa> swords, you do not have to use everything in your code
10:55 < RLa> you also want simplicity in your code, not it contain every single design pattern out there
11:08 < Martin_> Hello Everybody.
11:09 < Martin_> I am just trying to install mocha via npm and it blows up big time.
11:12 < deoxxa> Martin_: that's unfortunate
11:12 < Martin_> in my empty/fresh/clean package.json I tried to add "mocha": "*" and run it using "npm install" on mac os fails with diff@1.0.2 test: `expresso test/*` npm ERR! `sh "-c" "expresso test/*"` failed with 127 
11:13 < Martin_> I tried now 10 different versions and I havn't found one that doesn't result in this or a similar error with various packages.
11:13 < Martin_> (nodejs 0.8.15 on mac osx 10.8)
11:14 < deoxxa> can you paste the whole package.json somewhere?
11:14 < deoxxa> also, take a look at http://package.json.jit.su/
11:15 < Martin_> https://gist.github.com/4232590
11:17 < deoxxa> hrm
11:17 < deoxxa> and it fails when you try to install, not when you try to run tests or anything?
11:17 < Martin_> Yes, when I try to install them
11:19 < deoxxa> try removing mocha from your package.json and installing it with `npm install --save mocha'
11:21 < Martin_> breaks with the same error
11:21 < deoxxa> can you paste the whole error as well?
11:23 < Martin_> https://gist.github.com/3f5ebb5376d42683f0e7
11:25 < deoxxa> that's really odd
11:25 < deoxxa> is the node_modules directory empty (or preferably, gone) when you try to `npm install'?
11:26 < Martin_> Yes, i moved it to another location ...
11:26 < deoxxa> it looks like maybe the diff module isn't being extracted properly
11:26 < deoxxa> try `npm cache clean'
11:27 < deoxxa> that's a bit of a long shot though, admittedly
11:28 < Martin_> still same error ...
11:29 < deoxxa> :<
11:30 < Martin_> can/did you try it at your machine?
11:30 < deoxxa> i can do that
11:30 < deoxxa> i'm on the same system, 0.8.15 on os x
11:31 < Martin_> how fortunate!
11:31 < deoxxa> \o/
11:32 < Martin_> .oO( Damn it, i don't know what that emoticon means )
11:32 < deoxxa> it's a little waving guy
11:32 < deoxxa> https://gist.github.com/4232706
11:32 < deoxxa> seems to have gone fine for me
11:32 < Martin_> I see ...
11:32 < Martin_> so its a problem with this installation/machine ...
11:33 < Martin_> scary
11:33 < deoxxa> hmm
11:35 < Martin_> if I delete modules from /usr/local/lib/node_modules then it should clean the current installation, right?
11:36 < deoxxa> you'll have to remove any executables left sitting around in /usr/local/bin as well
11:37 < RLa> reinstall would overwrite those in /usr/local/bin
11:37 < Martin_> i see
11:38 < Martin_> will reinstall remove the old installation before that?
11:38 < RLa> reinstall?
11:38 < RLa> make install would just overwrite files in place
11:39 < Martin_> Does that mean that removing the modules might not be a bad idea?
11:39 < RLa> it's not
11:39 < RLa> i usually reinstall modules after upgrading node
11:40 < Martin_> hmm ... npm can not reinstall itself ;)
11:45 < thierry> Hi, I am setting up TCP communication between two servers, the first one sending requests to the second that will answer asynchronously. This is the very first time I am dealing with requests as low as TCP and I would appreciate greatly an article summing up the best practices, but I really can't find something like that, and maybe you can help me finding that. =)
11:50 < Martin_> It looks like I am in "deep-trouble" land.
11:51 < Martin_> Will investigate further an return with more infos.
11:52 < bnoordhuis> thierry: the net module's doc is pretty comprehensive
11:54 < thierry> I agree, but it is more on handling the request part, managing timeouts, and even more than that, a best practice that will allow the requesting server to link the answer it just received to one of the previous request he made, since the answer will be async.
12:00 < Martin_> okay, now I am terrified.
12:01 < Martin_> I removed node from my drive, reinstalled it and tried to "sudo npm install coffee-script -g" 
12:01 < Martin_> breaks ... 
12:01 < rio{> it's the new anti coffee-script protection
12:02 < Martin_> i see ...
12:03 < Martin_> it looks like npm downloads coffee-script into ~/,npm but tries to run the unit tests from /usr/local/lib ??
12:03 < radiodario> winston or bunyan?
12:06 < iksik2> anyone is using 'superagent' perhaps?
12:09 < Martin_> it seems like my .npmrc file was broken:
12:10 < Martin_> https://gist.github.com/ed231af50e04ce7c9baf
12:10 < Martin_> does this file look wrong to anybody ?
12:11 < spion> Whats the generally observed convention in node modules - is it camelCase or using_underscores? Or perhaps "if you have to ask, your code is not modular enough" :)
12:17 < Martin_> @spion lowercase i guess ... ;)
12:18 < spion> even with multiple words?
12:20 < Martin_> i havn't used a package with multiple words yet.
12:21 < gildean> well, the module names tend to be with a dash instead
12:21 < gildean> like http-proxy
12:21 < gildean> etc.
12:39 < simong> Am I correct in assuming that when a stream emit's an error event, I don't need to call .destroy on it?
12:45 < bnoordhuis> simong: that's usually the case
12:45 < simong> "usually"
12:45 < simong> So I shouldn't rely on it?
12:46 < bnoordhuis> simong: depends. what stream are we talking here?
12:46 < bnoordhuis> the node core streams all clean up after themselves
12:46 < bnoordhuis> but i can't vouch for third-party code
12:46 < simong> Mostly filestreams, but they can get piped to a couple of libraries that I don't have under my control
12:51 < bnoordhuis> simong: ah, file streams... you know, they don't auto-close the file descriptor
12:51 < bnoordhuis> but they do toggle their readable/writable flags
12:51 < bnoordhuis> it's kind of silly, come to think of it
12:51 < simong> Aha ok
12:51 < bnoordhuis> i think the original motivation was that the read/write error may be transient
12:51 < simong> I'll have to call .destroy than
12:52 < bnoordhuis> and that you should be able to restart it
12:52 < bnoordhuis> so yes, call .destroy :)
12:52 < simong> ok cool, thanks for the info :)
13:07 < bnoordhuis> simong: fyi, https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/4387
13:07 < simong> cool thanks
13:17 < Cronoh2> i am new to node and working on my first application, if i wanted to create a website where players login, can have teams and comments/reviews and such, as well as a live chat and looking for group type system between users, would i do the entire thing using node (I want to) or just the chat system and lfg stuff and use my native language (php w/ Symfony2) for the backbone (users/teams)?
13:28 < Erriond> Cronoh2: I would only do the chat in NodeJS (with help from SockJS/Socket.IO for pushing the messages to all receivers) and the team/login backbone in PHP/Symfony2
13:31 < Cronoh2> Erriond: Ok thanks for the info, i am making a test chat application right now using socket.io, node is freakin awesome, so im excited wasn't sure if i could somehow just use node to interact with my databases and do work, or if i should serve the pages using node like normal php pages, and seperately use node to run the chat and such as their own node server
13:54 < SoulRaven> hello
13:55 < SoulRaven> please help me with something
13:55 < SoulRaven> i have this prototype method: http://pastebin.com/E9cZz14P
13:56 < SoulRaven> and i called with new keyword, so the scope of "this" keyword is inside this method, how i call from inside an outside method that is from main method
13:58 < RLa> call what?
13:58 < bnoordhuis> SoulRaven: you mean var self = this in the constructor and then refer to self.prop in the embedded methods?
13:58 < Sly> bnoordhuis: long time, no talk. How you been lately?
13:58 < RLa> GeonamesJSON is supposed to be constructor?
13:59 < SoulRaven> RLa: yes
13:59 < bnoordhuis> Sly: harried. you? :)
13:59 < RLa> hm, are you simulating java's inner classes?
13:59 < RLa> it looks a bit like that
13:59 < Sly> bnoordhuis: tracking down bugs... that I have to wait to happen..
13:59 < Sly> So.. killing time, right now.
13:59 < SoulRaven> yes, an abstract class:))
14:00 < RLa> and you want to access GeoNames.this?
14:00 < SoulRaven> RLa: yes
14:00 < RLa> because i think that 'this' gets lost there
14:01 < SoulRaven> yes, when i invoke the method with new, scope of "this" is inside the method
14:01 < RLa> when GeonamesJSON is called as constructor, 'this' inside it is already the fresh object
14:01 < SoulRaven> https://gist.github.com/4233417
14:01 < RLa> you could try to ask in #javascript too
14:02 < SoulRaven> i have ask, but nobody answer
14:02 < SoulRaven> RLa: line 771
14:02 < RLa> maybe it's not possible but some expert should confirm it
14:05 < RLa> SoulRaven, try googling javascript nested classes
14:06 < SoulRaven> RLa: i will try
14:06 < SoulRaven> thx
14:06 < RLa> looks like there have been other tries to bring that classy oop concept into js
14:15 < Bux_> Nexxy?
14:19 < Bux_> @nexxylove
14:21 < Bux_> @nexxylove Whatsup?
14:32 < adam__> hello
14:32 < adam__> please could anyone tell me how can I install node.js in OS X as 32 bit?
14:36 < dawra> there must be some way to get line number and file name where the error occurs http://pastie.org/5494130
14:36 < dawra> else node sucks :/
14:38 < bnoordhuis> adam__: are you using the installer or compiling from source?
14:38 < radiodario> dawra: events.js:71
14:38 < radiodario> events.js is the file
14:38 < radiodario> 71 is the line
14:38 < bnoordhuis> adam__: if you're using brew, you'll have to ask the brew guys
14:39 < adam__> I'm reinstalling it with "./configure --dest-cpu=ia32"
14:39 < adam__> from source
14:39 < adam__> I hope this will work :)
14:39 < bnoordhuis> adam__: it should
14:39 < bnoordhuis> dawra: you forgot to install an error event listener
14:39 -!- mode/#node.js [+o piscisaureus_] by ChanServ
14:40 < dawra> i dont have any events.js file, must be node speicifc
14:40 < bnoordhuis> dawra: snarky people would make snarky comments now about how it's not node that sucks but your code
14:40 < bnoordhuis> fortunately there are no snarky people here
14:40 < adam__> by the way where can I find all the configure options for node.js?
14:40 < bnoordhuis> adam__: ./configure --help
14:41 < adam__> yay, thanks! :D
14:41 < dawra> lol
14:41 < bnoordhuis> dawra: you're (directly or indirectly) using net, http or https
14:42 < bnoordhuis> dawra: say you're doing var conn = net.createConnection(...), you need to add an error listener afterwards with conn.on('error', function(err) { ... })
14:42 < bnoordhuis> same for http, https, etc.
14:43 < dawra> ok
14:48 < adam__> didn't worked
14:48 < adam__> :(
14:49 < adam__> how can I check if it's 32 or 64 bit after I installed it?
14:53 < bnoordhuis> adam__: file path/to/node
14:53 < bnoordhuis> adam__: also `node -pe process.arch`
14:54 < adam__> Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
14:55 < adam__> for node -pe process.arch: x64
14:56 < bnoordhuis> adam__: is that master or v0.8?
14:56 < adam__> what do you mean?
14:56 < adam__> it's the latest version
14:56 < adam__> v0.8.15
14:57 < bnoordhuis> adam__: you didn't clone it from github.com/joyent/node?
14:57 < adam__> no
14:57 < adam__> http://nodejs.org/download/
14:57 < bnoordhuis> okay
14:57 < bnoordhuis> it might be that it's been fixed in master, i recall seeing a commit
14:57 < adam__> and I downloaded the source code: node-v0.8.15.tar.gz 
14:58 < adam__> so what should I do?
15:00 < bnoordhuis> adam__: first off, why do you need a 32 bit build?
15:00 < adam__> appjs
15:00 < bnoordhuis> why does that require a 32 bits build?
15:00 < adam__> http://appjs.org/
15:01 < adam__> AppJS requires 32bit Node on OS X. It works on 64bit OS X but Node must be 32bit. We're working on solving this, but it's a limitation of Chrome itself so it's a work in progress. Help us gain traction by starring this chromium issue.
15:01 < bnoordhuis> ah, chromium limitation
15:01 < bnoordhuis> okay
15:02 < adam__> so what can I do?
15:02 < bnoordhuis> let me check
15:03 < bnoordhuis> adam__: well, the master branch works
15:03 < bnoordhuis> i.e. it builds a 32 bit binary
15:03 < adam__> so I'm doing something wrong?
15:05 < bnoordhuis> adam__: possibly. let me check the v0.8 branch
15:07 -!- mode/#node.js [+o piscisaureus_] by ChanServ
15:07 < bnoordhuis> adam__: wfm with v0.8 as well so i guess you're doing something wrong, yes
15:08 < adam__> what's the best way to uninstall nodejs?
15:08 < adam__> I mean re-install 
15:08 < Doikor> just install it again?
15:09 < bnoordhuis> adam__: just run `make install` again
15:10 < adam__> now I used: ./configure --dest-cpu=ia32
15:11 < adam__> { 'target_defaults': { 'cflags': [],                        'default_configuration': 'Release',                        'defines': [],                        'include_dirs': [],                        'libraries': []},   'variables': { 'clang': 0,                  'gcc_version': 42,                  'host_arch': 'x64',                  'node_install_npm': 'true',                  'node_install_waf': 'true',                  'node_prefi
15:11 < adam__> and this is the response above
15:11 < bnoordhuis> adam__: what's target_arch set to?
15:12 < adam__> it's still 'target_arch': 'x64'
15:12 < adam__> how can I set that?
15:13 < bnoordhuis> adam__: with --dest-cpu=ia32. no idea why it's not working for you
15:14 -!- mode/#node.js [+o piscisaureus_] by ChanServ
15:15 < adam__> oh I think I wrote ./configure again :)
15:16 < adam__> and that reconfigured it to x64
15:16 < radiodario> i think host_arch might refer to what architecture your pc is 
15:16 < radiodario> rather than what you've asked for?
15:16 < radiodario> i.e. telling you that your computer is x64?
15:17 < bnoordhuis> adam__, radiodario: yes. host_arch and target_arch are separate things
15:18 < adam__> yeah I know
15:24 < Darsain> adam__: does appjs have some packaging system into standalone distributable app? or better, how is appjs differend from rogerwang/node-webkit project?
15:25 < adam__> I don't really know I'm just trying it :)
15:28 < adam__> but it seems impossible to run it on OSX :(
15:28 < adam__> now it's 32 bit
15:28 < adam__> thanks very much for the help guys
15:28 < adam__> but now I get this error :D
15:29 < adam__> 2012-12-07 07:26:05.341 node[62279:903] *** __NSAutoreleaseNoPool(): Object 0xb15ae0 of class NSPathStore2 autoreleased with no pool in place - just leaking 2012-12-07 07:26:05.342 node[62279:903] *** __NSAutoreleaseNoPool(): Object 0xc088a0 of class NSPathStore2 autoreleased with no pool in place - just leaking 2012-12-07 07:26:05.343 node[62279:903] *** __NSAutoreleaseNoPool(): Object 0xc08c50 of class NSCFString autoreleased with n

15:33 < bnoordhuis> adam__: that's probably an appjs error, node doesn't use any NS* classes
15:34 < sbeam> how 
15:34 < adam__> yes you are right 
15:35 < adam__> it sucks, I can't even reach the "hello world" with appjs
15:45 < drojas> Hi.. I need to set a cookie the first time a user visit my app.. I was trying to use use csrf token but it is absent the very first time..
15:48 < simak_alexandr> hello All ~~~
15:49 < simak_alexandr> Guys.. what is the best sqlite driver for nodejs??
16:00 < zoned> is there ANYWHERE that has a simple example of a node.js mysql crud application? something like node-cellar, but not using mongodb? i'm really trying to learn node, but i just can't find any good samples
16:10 < ardall_> tes
16:19 < pi_> Anyone who knows how to set process.env.PORT from the commandline? Just find why you should use it on heruko and so on..
16:20 < guor_> so like
16:20 < guor_> >> try { "abc" } finally { "def" }
16:20 < purr> guor_: (string) 'def'
16:21 < guor_> who would have though you can abuse try finally as an expression
16:24 < bnoordhuis> pi_: you mean `env PORT=1234 node script.js`?
16:26 < pi_> @bnoordhuis yep thanks, that was exactly what I was looking for ;)
16:53 < ppppaul> anyone here use Q?
16:53 < ppppaul> Q-IO?
16:54 < ppppaul> need some help with it... i can't even load the library
17:11 < lok> hey
17:11 < _Renegade> Could anyone tell me why Node won't call recur in this?
17:11 < _Renegade> http://pastie.org/5491582
17:12 < _Renegade> If I console.log(recur.toString()) I get the function as a string but if I try to call it one line later, it's undefined
17:16 < _Renegade> Gah, solved
17:16 < Kakera> what was the problem?
17:17 < Kakera> hm, so http.request will either accept a string and default to GET, or require an object with separate hostname and path?
17:17 < Kakera> what if I just want to post to a given URL?
17:21 < pifantastic> Kakera: use the request module?
17:22 < Kakera> pifantastic, I'm actually using superagent currently, but want to get rid of an unnecessary dependency
17:41 < darrenlooby> Hi Guys, I'm using supervisor to run a server. And, I'm wanting to pass some env vars in - anyone know how I should to this? Using Ubuntu
17:47 < Leo> Hello is there anyway to share variables in javascript? I mean like in C that you can include the header files (.h)
17:48 < WarheadsSE> expose it in an object member inside of the scope
17:48 < WarheadsSE> thats one method
17:48 < gavri> I'm requiring a.js from b.js which is required from c.js which is required from a.js
17:48 < gavri> will this even work?
17:48 < gavri> or should I just give up?
17:49 < gavri> I know that this is the result of poor design
17:49 < gavri> but I'd like for this to work if possible
17:49 < jrajav> gavri: http://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_cycles
17:49 < Leo> whats the error? should work depending on how your code works.
17:49 < darrenlooby> Leo - you can load a JSON file, or some configs as a module. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5869216/how-to-store-node-js-deployment-settings-configuration-files
17:50 < jrajav> I would highly recommend a rethinking of your design
17:50 < WarheadsSE> gavri: you're making an intentional circular dependancy?
17:50 < jrajav> Because if you think about it, there's now no way to guarantee the order of execution
17:50 < jrajav> Of the modules being required
17:51 < gavri> WarheadsSE: yeah
17:51 < jrajav> You should abstract out whatever is in a.js that b.js needs
17:51 < jrajav> Into a new module
17:51 < jrajav> Or you could separate out what's in c.js that a.js needs
17:53 < WarheadsSE> requirements circle-jerks are never sane ideas
17:53 < CoverSlide|Work> I've done it before
17:53 < CoverSlide|Work> it's do-able, but I'd recommend against it
17:53 < WarheadsSE> ^
17:54 < Leo> darrenlooby: but i needed it to be all shared at buf.. its not really constants (configuration settings)... do you get what i mean? i could save at the windows object at a browser in node i should save at the process object? would this be considered a correct method?
17:54 < tacirus> Hello any rus here?
17:54 < tacirus> Привет наши есть?
17:55 < tacirus> Yashi est?
17:55 < misterhat> not me 
17:55 < tacirus> Nashi est?
17:55 < misterhat> :P
17:55 < misterhat> google translator 
17:56 < superjoe> or you could have one module that defines both a and b as different fields in exports
17:56 < tacirus> misterhat: can you figure out why localhost:8888 can fail?
17:56 < CoverSlide|Work> bad code?
17:56 < superjoe> if they depend on each other, they probably shouldn't be different modules
17:57 < tacirus> it doesn`t do with nodejs
17:57 < tacirus> I think something is wrong in some settings on my laptop
17:57 < Coolrebel> Hey Nodecrew - I'm looking for a LA/SF CTO level engineer for a nodejs driven web app. Pretty intriguing video driven project - Any thoughts?
17:58 < WarheadsSE> Coolrebel: sadly, I can't relocate :P
17:58 < superjoe> Coolrebel, maybe you'll want to use my open-source transloadit server when it's done in a couple weeks :)
17:58 <@isaacs> WarheadsSE: can't?  that sounds awfully definite.
17:58 < CoverSlide|Work> I CAN HAZ CTO?
17:58 <@isaacs> WarheadsSE: are you tied to the land of your lord?
17:59 < WarheadsSE> isaacs: I can not. Child + custody.
17:59 <@isaacs> WarheadsSE: ah.  sold into serfdom, indeed.
17:59 < Coolrebel> Please take me seriously ;)
17:59 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: you are asking silly people to stop being silly.  ;P
17:59 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: good luck with that :)
17:59 < Coolrebel> didn't you see the ;)
17:59 <@isaacs> i did
18:00 < Coolrebel> silly people are usually smart people
18:00 <@isaacs> yeah, big correllation between intelligence and lightheartedness
18:00 < matbee> sarcasm?
18:00 < tnorris> isaacs: thanks for explaining #623. I missed that part in the Core Modules docs.
18:00 < Coolrebel> no!
18:00 < Coolrebel> not sarcasm. 4 realz
18:00 < s5fs> Coolrebel: by that measure i'm a f'ing genius
18:00 <@isaacs> grumpy programmers are insecure idiots.
18:01 < Coolrebel> I'm out of my league by defiinition
18:01 < CoverSlide|Work> How about YOU relocate to the LA area. Then we'll talk.
18:01 < Coolrebel> i ain't a programmer
18:01 < s5fs> Coolrebel: that's okay, nobody's perfect ;-)
18:01 < CoverSlide|Work> I'll have your people call my people.
18:01 < Coolrebel> hahaha
18:01 < Coolrebel> here's how much of an idiot i am
18:01 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: i'm not interested in being a cto of your thing, but if you aren't a programmer, what exactly are you offering?
18:02 < Coolrebel> i don't know how to do a @ person on this doodad
18:02 < Leo> For example.. if i have a module called user.js where users are loaded to buf from the db, i include user.js in a.js and b.js, a and b would each get a diferent instance of user.js correct? So if a change some 'user.propertie' in a.js it would not affect 'user.propertie' of b.js correct? is there anyway way to aproach this sharing the pointers?
18:02 < s5fs> in my mind a cto-level engineer is a guy who can't code but instead solves all problems using excel and vba.
18:02 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: you just type their name then a :
18:02 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: most irc clients tab-complete
18:02 <@isaacs> coo<TAB> --> Coolrebel:
18:02 < CoverSlide|Work> Coolrebel: Is this a "I have no idea how to do this, that's why I need a nerd." kind of thing?
18:02 < Coolrebel> isaacs: oh
18:02 < Coolrebel> No i have a pretty good idea of where this thang is going
18:02 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: do you have funding?
18:03 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: or a proof of concept?
18:03 < Coolrebel> i did my homework promise
18:03 < WarheadsSE> s5fs: lol
18:03 < Coolrebel> isaacs: don''t laugh
18:03 < WarheadsSE> i think promises were decided as a no-go for node's core ..
18:03 < s5fs> personally, I'm seeking a wealthy backer to pay me to work on their personal projects, in between flights on their private jet
18:03 < WarheadsSE> :P
18:03 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: the reason why people tend to not take such requests seriously is that 90% or more of the "idea" actually happens *after* the first implementation.
18:03 < _Tristan> is there a way to get npm -g to install things in a different place?
18:03 < CoverSlide|Work> my cardboard sign is getting lots of hits, lots of funding in my tin cup
18:03 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: so, if you've got zero lines of code, you have at best 10% of the idea fleshed out.
18:04 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: and that's if you've been *incredibly* thorough, way more than average.
18:04 < s5fs> concur
18:04 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: if you still "feel" like there are some open questions, then it's more like 5% done
18:04 < matbee> Also, youre asking the wrong type of developers, here
18:04 < matbee> you're looking for someone naive :P
18:04 <@isaacs> matbee: i dunno, i think we might be the right kind of developers.
18:04 < WarheadsSE> :P
18:04 < Coolrebel> isaacs: this may be true, but I have to try. I'm just reaching out
18:04 < CoverSlide|Work> I need some funding for my drinking habit
18:05 < s5fs> Coolrebel: the real question is "how thick is your beard" because really, you don't want a thin-beard if your project is to be successful
18:05 <@mbalho> o/ truth
18:05 < s5fs> hence, recruiting in cooler climates
18:05 < Coolrebel> Isaacs: really looking to talk to someone who can answer questions. You're right about the code thing but the point is this - we need money
18:05 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: so, if you're not technical, and you have 5% of an idea, what you can offer is "I've talked to a bunch of VC's and have a serious line on funding, provided we can get a PoC done in X months, etc."
18:05 < matbee> Coolrebel, don't let us get you down though -- if you're serious about it-- pursue and head to meetups :)
18:05 < CoverSlide|Work> Not alcohol, I don't touch the stuff, but I can't drink anything without .05% gold shavings. It gets pretty expensive.
18:05 < Coolrebel> i'm not after vc money
18:05 < ryanrolds_w> I don't know about you guys, but I'm having a hard time taking someone with the name coolrebel seriously.
18:05 < Coolrebel> i want a business not a flip
18:06 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: ok, but you aren't independently wealthy
18:06 < Coolrebel> ryanrolds w: that's not my real name
18:06 < matbee> lol
18:06 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: so if i said yes, and want to work with you, why shoulnd't i just pay you $1000 for your idea, and build it myself?
18:06 < BestIdeaEver> Guys, I have this awesome idea
18:06 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: or better yet, pay you lunch for your idea.
18:06 < BestIdeaEver> Please help me, it's awesome.
18:06 < Coolrebel> No reason
18:06 < matbee> Coolrebel, not a single dev. friend?
18:06 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: So, my suggestion is this: write some code.
18:06 < CoverSlide|Work> The best way to start is with a group of close friends in college living off parents money.
18:06 < Coolrebel> I need a good one
18:07 < matbee> Coolrebel, no you need a dedicated one.
18:07 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: like, for real.  get your hands dirty, and write a video streaming app in JavaScript
18:07 < CoverSlide|Work> matbee++
18:07 < Coolrebel> true
18:07 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: if you don't speak that language, you're in trouble.
18:07 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: i'm not saying this to discourage you.  i'm saying this to ENcourage you
18:07 < s5fs> Coolrebel: so what DO you do friend?
18:07 < Coolrebel> The key is $$$
18:08 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: so, get a job, and in the 40+ hours per week that you're not at work, and not sleeping, learn to program.
18:08 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: it should take you a month or two.
18:08 < CoverSlide|Work> just get 1000 monkeys and 1000 typewriters
18:08 < CoverSlide|Work> they'll write your program eventually
18:08 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: that's way less time than it'll take to find the mythical "I just need an idea guy" programmer, who doesn't exist.
18:08 < s5fs> CoverSlide|Work: in this economy? more like 500 monkeys and 1000 typewriters.
18:08 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: most good programmers have zillions of ideas.
18:08 < matbee> One big problem in the Bay Area, there's not enough developers.
18:08 < matbee> so you'll NEED funding to attract one
18:08 < Coolrebel> I don't need an idea guy. I nkow exactly what I want
18:09 < jrajav> Not me. I just sit around all day twiddling my thumbs
18:09 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: you ARE the idea guy
18:09 < jrajav> Just WAITING for some dude to email me saying he needs my skills
18:09 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: the problem is that programmers don't need YOU
18:09 < CoverSlide|Work> Coolrebel: what you want and what pays the bills may be entirely different things
18:09 < ryanrolds> And you JUST need someone to build it for you, got it.
18:09 < matbee> lol
18:09 < darrenlooby> Sorry to interrupt guys. I've set a variable at the top of my script... and a function that edits it. I'm trying to move that function to a module, but it can't access that var... how do I solve that? Is there such a thing as global vars in node.js
18:09 < WarheadsSE> problem is we need $ to build it.
18:09 < s5fs> yeah, like a carpenter, but for code
18:09 < Coolrebel> Isaacs: I know but none of you dudes has ome up wiith my idea yet
18:09 < Coolrebel> so get with it
18:09 < CoverSlide|Work> darrenlooby: you can do global variables, but it's discouraged
18:09 < matbee> Coolrebel, it already exists in our minds ;)
18:09 <@isaacs> darrenlooby: pass in the arg as a parameter to the function, and have the function pass it back as the return value (or in a callback)
18:10 < jrajav> darrenlooby: Change it so that the function is a proper function rather than something that changes global state
18:10 < s5fs> Coolrebel: that's the funny thing about ideas though, they're usually not new.
18:10 <@isaacs> darrenlooby: there are globals, but eff that noise.
18:10 < jrajav> darrenlooby: Pass in a parameter and return a result
18:10 < darrenlooby> Co
18:10 < jrajav> darrenlooby: (Or call a callback with the result)
18:10 <@isaacs> darrenlooby: globals get unweildy fast.
18:10 < gildean> Coolrebel: if you have money, you can just hire people?
18:10 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: so, implement it.
18:10 < WarheadsSE> ^
18:10 < gildean> Coolrebel: and they don't have to be located where you are
18:10 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: what's stopping you, except your lack of javascript skills?
18:10 < Coolrebel> nothing
18:10 < matbee> ideas are 2%
18:10 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: the solution to that is WAY more realistic than the solution to "i just need a developer"
18:10 < CoverSlide|Work> also, in a commonjs-like system such as node, modularity is preferred, and global variables are not modular
18:10 < gildean> the year is 2012 and data moves at the speed of light
18:11 < Coolrebel> why am i here be i don't have them. i don't think like that
18:11 < s5fs> gildean: then why is my uploading taking so long!
18:11 < Coolrebel> i have a hard time with css
18:11 < matbee> lol
18:11 < Coolrebel> for f's sake
18:11 < newguy> lol
18:11 < CoverSlide|Work> Coolrebel: spam linkedin
18:11 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: again, i'm really honestly trying to help.
18:11 < Coolrebel> i know dude
18:11 < WarheadsSE> yeah, you're at the ~0.5% stage Coolrebel
18:11 < gildean> s5fs: well it's winter so it's quite dark
18:11 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: like, i feel for you.  i know how that is when you know what the idea is, and you knwo it'd be awesome.
18:11 < Coolrebel> i'd rather talk to someone. 
18:11 < konobi> if you're not willing to dive you yourself, why would someone else put effort in?
18:11 < superjoe> darrenlooby, can you provide a code snippet of what you're trying to accomplish?
18:11 < s5fs> gildean: shit, great point.
18:11 < CoverSlide|Work> brace yourself, winter is ... well here
18:11 < s5fs> brb flashlight
18:12 < WarheadsSE> CoverSlide|Work: oh please don't encourage more LinkedIn spam!
18:12 < matbee> isaacs, are you @izs?
18:12 < Coolrebel> i'm not going to spam anyone
18:12 < ryanrolds> Yes he is.
18:12 < Coolrebel> i want to talk to someone
18:12 < s5fs> lol
18:12 < matbee> ah ok
18:12 < Coolrebel> no i'm not!!!
18:12 < WarheadsSE> we're "talking"
18:12 < matbee> LOL
18:12 < CoverSlide|Work> OOoooh I wanna dance with somebody!!!
18:12 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: then don't offer "come to sf or la and be my cto".  offer "i'll pay for 2 hours of your time to consult"
18:12 < Coolrebel> no using a phone. dancing wiht a phone
18:12 < WarheadsSE> but honestly, without the prior $ availability, nothing is likely to happen for you
18:12 <@isaacs> matbee: yessir
18:12 < s5fs> Coolrebel: so you do or do not have funding?
18:13 < Coolrebel> nope 
18:13 < WarheadsSE> hence, problem
18:13 < iksik2> ;-)
18:13 < matbee> To bootstrap, you absolutely NEED to have a best-friend as a developer
18:13 < Coolrebel> not a problem
18:13 < matbee> or YOU have to be a developer
18:13 < WarheadsSE> most of us however will do consulting on projects, but! you'd need to pay us
18:13 < Coolrebel> not going to boostrrap
18:13 < s5fs> i had this really excellent idea once, but no money. so now i work full time.
18:13 < Coolrebel> don't knw a dev good enough
18:13 < CoverSlide|Work> so you want a developer to work for free? or 50% of $0?
18:13 < konobi> there are events for these sort of things
18:13 < Coolrebel> nope
18:13 < s5fs> CoverSlide|Work: I'll pay you 75% of $0!!
18:13 < WarheadsSE> konobi: indeed
18:13 < Coolrebel> i want a developer to be on the bp
18:13 < matbee> Coolrebel, go to the next Startup Weekend and pitch your idea :)
18:13 < Coolrebel> until i get the money to pay the
18:13 < CoverSlide|Work> s5fs: WHEN DO I START?
18:14 < Coolrebel> no way
18:14 < Coolrebel> i hate those startup things
18:14 < iksik2> s5fs: pfff, i can pay him 80% of $0 ;>
18:14 < s5fs> CoverSlide|Work: yesterday, of course. you're already late on your first deliverable!
18:14 < matbee> oh god
18:14 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: mbalho made this site for you: http://jsforcats.com/
18:14 < s5fs> iksik2: i can't compete with that. good luck!
18:14 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: learn you some js.
18:14  * WarheadsSE needs to find a local startup weekend
18:14 < Coolrebel> not going to happen isaacs
18:14 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: write a dumb shitty little poc
18:14 < matbee> Coolrebel, I actually won the startup weekend in Toronto, and just won the global startup battle
18:14 < Coolrebel> it's just not
18:14 < s5fs> WarheadsSE: where located?
18:14 < matbee> trust me, its well worth it
18:14 < iksik2> ;P
18:14 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: why are you so insistent that it's impossible for you to learn to code a little?
18:14 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: and you want to run a tech startup?
18:15 < WarheadsSE> s5fs: nearest major: philly
18:15 < CoverSlide|Work> the whole startuppy thing in the valley kind of sucks right now, way too saturated
18:15 < Coolrebel> its a creative startup wiht a tech element
18:15 < matbee> WarheadsSE, totally do it.
18:15 < Coolrebel> it's as much about design as it is about tech
18:15 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: that's like wanting to run a restaurant and not knowing how to make grilled cheese
18:15 < CoverSlide|Work> oh that's even worse
18:15 < s5fs> WarheadsSE: sorry, don't know the area although my little bro lives in churchville.
18:15 < jrajav> It's a bit like wanting to run Tesla Manufacturing without understanding what "torque" is
18:15 < matbee> LOL
18:15 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: ok, so you should know some design, AND how to code.
18:15 < Coolrebel> the design i know
18:15 < CoverSlide|Work> I feel sorry for any devs in the entertainment biz. I was one of those.
18:15 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: all the more reason why you should learn to program.  know your tools!
18:15 < q_> anyone know where req.form went in the new express ?  I pray for the day when that api gets solidified
18:15 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: are you designing with watercolors?
18:16 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: or are you using a computer?
18:16 < CoverSlide|Work> In the entertainment biz, a 12 hour workday is considered part-time
18:16 < WarheadsSE> q_ check the migrtion guide
18:16 < WarheadsSE> matbee: yes, i need to *find* one
18:16 < lohkey> Coolrebel: you don't have to be a technical founder to start a tech company, but it helps
18:16 < Coolrebel> isaacs: here's the bottom line. If i can't code which i can't. i have to hire someone
18:16 < matbee> it's hard to justify going to some guys ideas when dev's can grab 120k+ salary in cali
18:16 < s5fs> Coolrebel: honestly, if you can't attract talent with money, then you need to attract them with the idea. your idea may be fully excellent, but if it's not interesting TO ME, then I won't work on it.
18:16 < konobi> Coolrebel: "if you're not willing to dive in yourself, why would someone else put effort in?"
18:16 < Coolrebel> if i don't have the money i have to get it and then pay someone
18:16 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: why is that your "bottom line"?  how do you think people BECOME coders?
18:16 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: they are not born.
18:16 < ryanrolds> s5fs hit the nail on the head.
18:16 < lohkey> Coolrebel: or you can just find a technical cofounder
18:16 < matbee> isaacs, to be fair, i was born.
18:17 < jrajav> I *think* I was born
18:17 < jrajav> I have no proof
18:17 < Coolrebel> clearly i haven't been born
18:17 < matbee> lol
18:17 < s5fs> matbee: i heard you were born onto a pile of lego, is truth?
18:17 < matbee> s5fs, a pirate ship, actually
18:17 < konobi> the clones are taking over... run for it!
18:17 < s5fs> sick
18:17  * isaacs was born a tiny screaming pile of worthless human covered in some lady's body juices
18:17  * isaacs had to become a programmer
18:17 < matbee> yikes
18:17 < CoverSlide|Work> isaacs: except for jeff atwood's kid: http://codinghorror.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b012877708537970c-pi
18:18 < ryanrolds> Lego birthing? Awesome.
18:18 < jrajav> isaacs: Sounds like a great night on the town to me
18:18 -!- mode/#node.js [+o konobi] by ChanServ
18:18 <@isaacs> CoverSlide|Work: you know that kids' gonna become a pro athelete or something, just to rebel
18:18 < s5fs> jrajav: who doesn't love screaming?
18:18 < CoverSlide|Work> haha true
18:18 <@konobi> isaacs: what do you mean "born" that's how you are now... no?
18:19 < s5fs> it was either welding or programming. i made my choice.
18:19 <@isaacs> konobi: right, but now i write js
18:19 <@isaacs> konobi: ;)
18:19 < Coolrebel> so let me ask a question?
18:19 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: ask away :)
18:19 -!- Topic for #node.js: Node.js - http://nodejs.org - The internet is watching you http://logs.nodejs.org/node.js/ - jerks get kickbanned

18:20 -!- isaacs changed the topic of #Node.js to: Node.js - Neuvo Operations Define Excellence point javascript - http://logs.nodejs.org/node.js/ - jerks get kickbanned
18:20 < Coolrebel> do developers become CTOs to unfunded startups > with a guarantee they'll get paid x if it's funded
18:20 < Coolrebel> ?
18:20 <@konobi> not really
18:20 < matbee> If he's your best friend
18:20 < matbee> he/she
18:20 < matbee> sorry internet
18:21 < s5fs> Coolrebel: there seems to be a strong lack of interest for most developers to move into management in general.
18:21 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: if i was to take that kind of risk, it would rest heavily on the confidence that the CEO is a) not a douchebag, and b) likely to succeed and c) not likely to screw me over.
18:21 < Coolrebel> But why. All you have to do is put your name on a BP + deck
18:21 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: none of those three are likely if i dont' know you VERY well.
18:21 <@konobi> it's about risk, investment and return on that investment
18:21 < Coolrebel> isaacs: i can handle a and c
18:21 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: ir if you don't have a significant good reputation
18:21 < Coolrebel> b not so sure
18:21 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: no, you cna't.
18:21 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: it's not about whether or not it's true.
18:21 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: it's aobut whether or not you can CONVINCE me it's true.
18:22 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: who are you?  just some guy.
18:22 < WarheadsSE> Coolrebel: problem is the number of developers willing to take unpaid gamble in this economy
18:22 < matbee> Coolrebel, I can accept a job right now in SF for a ridiculous salary, or I could not know you at all-- and not get paid whatsoever
18:22 < matbee> lol
18:22 < Coolrebel> I'm just some guy until you talk to me
18:22 < Coolrebel> or meet me
18:22  * WarheadsSE ist still job hunting.. still overqualified for damned near everything open.
18:22 < Coolrebel> isn't that how business is done
18:22 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: and, if you have literally nothing right now except an idea, and A, B, and C are all in my favor, great.  I want 95% of the company, off the bat.
18:22 < Coolrebel> ?
18:22 < Coolrebel> haha
18:22 < matbee> WarheadsSE, come to toronto, we're hiring! :P
18:22 < matbee> AND paying for relocation!
18:22 <@konobi> matbee: hiring already!?
18:22 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: you laugh, but 95% is what i'll be bringing to the table.
18:23 < matbee> konobi, nono my f/t gig
18:23 < CoverSlide|Work> My first order as CTO is relocate to LA
18:23 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: and you relocate to me, not the other way around.
18:23 <@konobi> ah
18:23 < s5fs> matbee: canada, eh? moose steak sign-on bonuses!
18:23 < WarheadsSE> matbee: you must have missed, I can't relocate
18:23 < shama> imo, ideas are shit, execution is everything
18:23 <@konobi> shama: bingo
18:23 < CoverSlide|Work> Image is nothing! Thirst is everything! 
18:23 < jrajav> execution is more than coding, mind you
18:23 < matbee> konobi, we're totally all over toronto news, angel investors are lovin' us! :P
18:23 < CoverSlide|Work> Obey your thirst!
18:23 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: because it's going to be on me to a) build the technical team, b) design the architecture, c) figure out all the problems with "your" idea, d) write a mountain of code.
18:24 < Coolrebel> isaacs: so do you guys work on a pay only basis? 
18:24 < jrajav> Having a business cofounder is worth something, but it's usually not "ideas"
18:24 < Coolrebel> unless it's a friend
18:24 < CoverSlide|Work> Ideas are a dime a dozen
18:24 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: i work on Node.js out of love.  Joyent pays me because they want me to continue.
18:24 < s5fs> Coolrebel: basically, yes.
18:24 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: most programmers work for a paycheck, or start a startup with a friend who is also technical.
18:24 < jrajav> isaacs is a being constructed of pure love
18:24 < s5fs> Coolrebel: you pay to keep developer eyes on YOUR problem, otherwise eyes wander towards the shiny.
18:24 < jrajav> Ever play Katamari Damacy?
18:24 < CoverSlide|Work> I'll write an app to share photos of dog shit if you pay me enough
18:24 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: there's actually no room for idea guys.
18:24 < jrajav> It's kinda like that
18:25 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: that's why you need to learn to code, or get a job as a designer at a tech company and maybe make some friends.
18:25 < gildean> isaacs: yeah, and you're lucky that way, getting to work on something you love
18:25 < Coolrebel> isaacs: maybe that's why so many ideas suck
18:25 < jrajav> Coolrebel: The only thing a programmer will ever work on without being paid is something that interests him personally.
18:25 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: maybe one of them will start a startup, and want to hire a designer.
18:25 < bwinton> CoverSlide|Work: That's oddly tempting.  Is Poopr.com available?  :)
18:25 < CoverSlide|Work> Coolrebel: yours must be the exception then
18:25 <@konobi> bwinton: poop.in?
18:25 < bwinton> konobi: Even better!
18:25 < s5fs> bwinton: excrement.io?
18:25 < CoverSlide|Work> ratemypoo.com is still going strong
18:25 < Coolrebel> here's the problem - coding is a way of life - it's just not my way of life. 
18:25 < s5fs> i had compostableshit.com for a while
18:25 < iksik2> rotfl -_-
18:26 < jrajav> fecestagram
18:26 <@isaacs> s5fs: the "o" i grok, but the "i" squicks me a bit.
18:26 < Coolrebel> isaacs: you do what you love
18:26 < s5fs> isaacs: southpark
18:26 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: no, coding is a way of telling computers what to do.
18:26 < CoverSlide|Work> haha
18:26 < Coolrebel> so do i .... they're different
18:26 < s5fs> isaacs: so coding is like management?
18:26 < addisonj_> okay, question time, how should I handle httpAgent.maxSockets with large amounts of connections and load? we have our app split into a few discrete services and our API just proxy calls back. If one of the services has a short interruption, at load we stack up connections behind the agent. And the connections aren't timing out like we expect
18:26 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: writing programs is not some magical talent.  it just takes some practice to learn how to do it.
18:26 <@konobi> i've had offers in the past for tech co-founder... and generally turned them down for 2 reasons a) the package was weak b) i didn't believe in their persons ability to execute
18:26 < jrajav> Coolrebel: Anywhere you see coding? You can usually put "creating" instead.
18:27 < jrajav> Coolrebel: That's what we're really doing
18:27 < s5fs> ^ agreed
18:27 < CoverSlide|Work> addisonj_: http.globalAgent.maxSockets = Infinity
18:27 < CoverSlide|Work> problem solved. next!
18:27 < Coolrebel> I'm not saying you're wrong. I'm just saying it's a mindset. Anyone can't just Do it. 
18:27 < addisonj_> CoverSlide|Work: what about reuse? that will kill connection reuse won't it?
18:27 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: you're wrong.  anyone can just Do It.
18:27 < CoverSlide|Work> Coolrebel: you must be the exception then
18:27 < Coolrebel> To what I'm losing track
18:27 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: coding is like playing the guitar.  a lot of idiots do it really well, because they practice.
18:28 < s5fs> Coolrebel: everyone can DO it, not everyone WANTS to do it. i think that's the fundamental disconnect.
18:28 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: and you see someone playing the guitar really well, and go "mwah, i wish i could play the guitar, mwah"
18:28 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: and it's not like that guy was born playing.
18:28 < jrajav> Coolrebel: Here's a tip: We recognize that businesses are a fuckton of work, and we hate most of it. Administration, marketing, yeck, bleck, no thank you. Pitch THAT instead. Offer to execute on everything that matters except the fun creating.
18:28 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: he practiced for years and years.  that's all.  and coding is WAY easier.
18:28 < jrajav> That is something of value
18:28 < jrajav> "Idea"? We have those literally every day
18:28 < s5fs> jrajav: concurc
18:29 < Zitter> the simplest way to send JSON data to node.js from my arduino?
18:29 < jrajav> And we're unlikely to think that yours is somehow better just because you can't code
18:29 < q_> I hate this so much, I think im goign to move away from express this is ridicolous , are there any other web frameworks ?
18:29 < Coolrebel> jrajav: i think that goes without saying. i'm not pitching you the business. you don't know what that is
18:29 <@isaacs> q_: i prefer not using a framework.
18:29 <@isaacs> q_: just use node itself, and some modules to do stuff.
18:29 < s5fs> q_: whats your beef with express? you can roll your own easily with just connect.
18:29 < Coolrebel> jrajav: heck you don't evne know my real name!
18:29 <@isaacs> q_: check out https://github.com/isaacs/npm-www
18:30 < tjholowaychuk> roll your own with asm
18:30 < jrajav> Coolrebel: My statement didn't depend on knowing it
18:30 <@isaacs> it's the tjholowaychuk!!
18:30 < tjholowaychuk> haha
18:30 < Coolrebel> jrajav
18:30 < s5fs> tjholowaychuk: embedded j# or gtfo
18:30 < jrajav> zomg tjholowaychuk!
18:30 < jrajav> tjholowaychuk: I'm the dude who wrote the TOC for the mocha page :D
18:30 < tjholowaychuk> q_ what problem are you having?
18:30 < jrajav> Now I can bug you about it
18:30 < Coolrebel> jrajav: i guess that's true, but so is my first sentence. of course i'm gonna handle all that shit
18:30 <@konobi> Coolrebel: as far as anyone can tell, you're pitching bullshit. so maybe realize that and actually pitch something
18:31 < s5fs> has he given any detail on his idea yet, or did i miss that?
18:31 < Coolrebel> konobi: isaacs: said he'd buy my ideea for a breakfast at denny's. if he offers more...maybe I won't BS you
18:31 < jrajav> Are you kidding s5fs?
18:31 < jrajav> That things worth billions
18:31 < s5fs> "its like facebook, but for the surgically mutilated"
18:32 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: so, i know it sounds like i'm suggesting the impossible.  but running a startup is about realizing that the "impossible" is just a matter of working on it a lot.
18:32 < s5fs> "its like X, but Y"
18:32 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: start with your aversion to javascript.
18:32 <@konobi> Coolrebel: he offered to buy the idea... not buy into it =0)
18:32 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: install node.  write a program that says "hello world".
18:32 < iksik2> http://secretgeek.net/dod_intro.asp - someone was looking for alternative to express? :PPPP
18:32 < Coolrebel> I don't have an aversion to it.
18:32 < s5fs> my buddy started a little side project, aftrer about 18mo it's finally paying for it's own hosting. TTT and all that.
18:32 < CoverSlide|Work> I hear there's lots of developers in #RubyOnRails.
18:33 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: actually, in exchange for 100% of your idea, i will give you the opportunity to buy me lunch.  final offer.
18:33 < jrajav> It may be more productive to learn a rapid prototyping tool
18:33 < matbee> LOL
18:33 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: i'm going ot need yo uto sign a non-compete before we start, though.
18:33 < ryanrolds> haha
18:33 < matbee> I think the bottom line is that you need to befriend a developer, quickly
18:33 < Coolrebel> isaacs: I'm talking to a bunch of developers and they're telling me to write hello world in code. gee thanks
18:33 < jrajav> isaacs: Dude I have an idea :P
18:33 < matbee> ALSO dev's will know if you only want to befriend them to get something out of them
18:34 < matbee> so you'd better not be a douchebag
18:34 < Coolrebel> i'm not a fucking douchebag
18:34 < matbee> nobody cares who you have sex with
18:34 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: sometimes when knowledgible people tell you something that sounds crazy, but only takes a few hours to investigate, you should just go try it, rather than spend a few hours convincing yourself that they must be wrong.
18:34 < Coolrebel> i mean i'm not a douchebag
18:34 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: it doesn't take that long to find out that you actually have all it takes to code, except time and practice.
18:34 < CoverSlide|Work> Coolrebel: that's what all douchebags say
18:34 < matbee> LOL
18:34 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: then you can write a proof of concept, get funding, and hire developers.
18:34 < Coolrebel> haha
18:35 < s5fs> Coolrebel: if you were in here asking for talent to start a tacocopter company you'd have developers lining up.
18:35 < superjoe> wait he doesn't have funding?
18:35 <@konobi> s5fs: been done
18:35 < jrajav> omg tacocopters
18:35 < matbee> superjoe, lol!
18:35 < jrajav> superjoe: Welcome to the conversation
18:35 < Coolrebel> I'm just asking for someone to be on the BP after a few discussions. I'm not asking for actual work 
18:35 < ryanrolds> Sign me up for tacocopter, inc.
18:35 < jrajav> superjoe: Please enjoy your stay
18:35 < q_> tjholowaychuk, the plugins are breaking when upgrading express, connect-mongolian-session and connect-form
18:35 <@konobi> BP?
18:35 < s5fs> konobi: exactly right, we loves tacocopters
18:35 < matbee> bridal path
18:35 < ryanrolds> Now, are we talking copters that deliver tacos or copters made of tacos?
18:35 < q_> isaacs, ok thanks I'll check it out
18:35 < CoverSlide|Work> startups get started by groups of college students, where all of them know how to code, and at least half of them are exceptional coders
18:35 < tjholowaychuk> q_: ah I see, connnect-form is like 2 years old
18:35 < tjholowaychuk> but
18:35 <@isaacs> board of putzes?
18:36 < tjholowaychuk> i cant speak for the other one
18:36 < s5fs> ryanrolds: little bit of A, little bit of B
18:36 < CoverSlide|Work> Tech companies get started that way
18:36 < matbee> The days of jsut having an idea and getting rich are over
18:36 <@konobi> you want to put me on an oil rig?
18:36 < Coolrebel> I don't want ot get rich
18:36 <@isaacs> baudy puns?
18:36 < CoverSlide|Work> And they have no risk cause they're living on their parent's dime
18:36 < matbee> big peni...
18:36 < tjholowaychuk> q_: aka use req.files, you dont need connect-form at all anymore
18:36 < ryanrolds> I'm down with copters made of tacos delivering tacos.
18:36 < matbee> ryanrolds, amazing.
18:36 < jrajav> *tacos within tacos
18:36 < CoverSlide|Work> Coolrebel: how old are you? if over 26 you're too old to start a tech company
18:36 < ryanrolds> If you're really hungry you just eat the copter too
18:36 < matbee> SEND ME SOME DIP TACOS!
18:36 < s5fs> ryanrolds: epic, lets see if Coolrebel can find us funding
18:37 < q_> tjholowaychuk, ok sweet
18:37 < Coolrebel> I'm way over 26
18:37 < jrajav> meta-tacos?
18:37 < matbee> 27?
18:37 < CoverSlide|Work> Coolrebel: so go back to your day job and forget your "killer idea"
18:37 < Coolrebel> i wish
18:37 <@isaacs> CoverSlide|Work: lol
18:37 < matbee> lol
18:37 <@isaacs> you can start a tech company at any age.
18:37 < matbee> wait, im over 26.
18:37 < jrajav> Now we're just getting mean
18:37 < matbee> :(
18:37 < CoverSlide|Work> isaacs: your FIRST tech company
18:37  * isaacs is well over 26
18:37 < matbee> but i still look 15
18:37 < matbee> so heeyooo
18:37 < jrajav> I'm under 26. What do I win?
18:37 < CoverSlide|Work> or at least some tech experience
18:37 <@isaacs> though i guess my first tech company was just me doing consulting.
18:38 < q_> jrajav, youth!
18:38 < ryanrolds> o/ over 26 buddies
18:38 < iksik2> jrajav: a taco :P
18:38 <@isaacs> you can also learn to code at any age.
18:38 < jrajav> Those are both awesome
18:38 < bwinton> jrajav: You win long hours and eating ramen 7 days a week for the chance to make a lot of money!
18:38 < Coolrebel> I could have 26 year old kids
18:38 < s5fs> "I've got 17 years experience in medical sales, and am looking for people interested in doing a startup with me."
18:38 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: what if i told you that i'd hear your pitch, but only after you wrote a working peer-to-peer replication system in Node?
18:38 <@konobi> oh... bp, business proposal
18:38 < CoverSlide|Work> Most incubators and investors won't fund anyone who either has some startup experience or is young enough to have little to lose.
18:38 <@isaacs> konobi: oohhh...
18:39 < Coolrebel> isaacs: i'm guessing that if i said yes to that, i probably wouldn't need you. 
18:39 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: sure you would.
18:39 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: once you did that, you'd be *qualified* to pitck to me.
18:39 < Coolrebel> haha
18:39 < matbee> think of developers as your gods
18:40 < iksik2> hah
18:40 < CoverSlide|Work> Coolrebel: do you have an office space? do you have payroll, personnel, business deals set up? What are you going to do while I'm doing all the hard work coding? "Thinking"
18:40 < CoverSlide|Work> ?
18:40 < Coolrebel> Do you need anyone elsee thinking you're god. aren't you enough?
18:40 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: and if you can't search google and copy and paste some api examples together, then why should i think that you can possibly run a business in the real world with real people, or have the persistence to chase down sales and leads and investors?
18:40 < s5fs> matbee: they certainly view themselves that way ;-)
18:40 < CoverSlide|Work> Or looking over my shoulder at stuff you don't understand?
18:40 < matbee> s5fs, i could hardly tell by this convo :P
18:40 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: the point is that coders ARENT gods.
18:40 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: and coding ISNT magic.
18:40 < jrajav> isaacs: fu :(
18:40 < matbee> whoaaa, you're ruining my mojo man
18:41 < s5fs> isaacs: dude, i've got a performance review soon, quit with that kinda talk!
18:41 <@isaacs> hahaha
18:41  * jrajav unequips his wizard staff
18:41 <@isaacs> srsly, though, i mean, we all know that right?
18:41 < CoverSlide|Work> coding: http://i.minus.com/ijCBM2h1of0vE.gif
18:41 <@isaacs> programming is like the most easy overpaid profession ever.
18:41 < s5fs> isaacs: in all seriousness, yes.
18:41 < CoverSlide|Work> isaacs: true
18:41 < Coolrebel> The funny thing is that the proof of concept for my idea was already written
18:41 < chrisdickinson> i wonder if there are paid, professional nappers.
18:41 < CoverSlide|Work> and i spend 4 hours a day trolling on irc
18:41 <@konobi> isaacs: +5 XP - unlocked "Dashing hopes"
18:41  * isaacs has knocked on doors to sell vaccuum cleaners.
18:41 < jrajav> isaacs: Dude, stop, stop, he's going to tell EVERYONE
18:41 < s5fs> isaacs: it is for some, but not for all. i mean, all I fucking DO is related to programming, even in my free time. it's hard to find others who share that desire.
18:42  * isaacs has gotten up at 4 am to make bagels in a bakery
18:42 <@isaacs> programming is NOT "real work"
18:42 < tnorris> I feel like this conversation should be on #philosophicalideasonprogrammers
18:42 < s5fs> tnorris: friday is philosophy talk, apparently
18:42 < Coolrebel> isaacs: trust me it would be real work to me
18:42 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: it's not easy, butneither is salsa, and plenty of people do that for fun
18:42 < jrajav> Aaaand we're back to tacos
18:42 < s5fs> Coolrebel: so do you have a business plan drawn up? detailed spec for your idea? how far into this project have you delved?
18:43 < CoverSlide|Work> Coolrebel: you haven't answered my question, while the coder is doing all the real work, what will YOU be doing except more "thinking"?
18:43 <@isaacs> jrajav: i meant the dance.  but yes, making good salsa is a fine art.
18:43 < CoverSlide|Work> I think all day
18:43 < jrajav> Oh haha
18:43 < Coolrebel> s5fs: pretty deep
18:43 < CoverSlide|Work> Most of it I don't get paid for
18:43 < jrajav> I was actually a dancer through most of college
18:43 < jrajav> Never salsa though
18:43 < iksik2> isaacs: well the same thing i can tell about any other job ;-)
18:43 < iksik2> so... what the 'real job' is?
18:43 < Coolrebel> But i'm crap at salsa
18:43 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: me, to.
18:44 <@isaacs> *too
18:45 < Coolrebel> I agree ideas are worth 5%, but development isn't worth 95%
18:45 < matbee> isaacs, I've burned body parts in an incinerator. THAT Was work.
18:45 < matbee> don't ask.
18:45 <@isaacs> matbee: for reals
18:45 < iksik2> Coolrebel: 100% agree ;-)
18:45 < Coolrebel> matbee: I'm counting you out of the CTO search
18:45 <@isaacs> no one ever slammed their door in my face or sicked their dog on me while i was writing code.
18:46 <@konobi> Coolrebel: k... i take 95% up front, decreasing in steps as timelines and deadlines are met
18:46 < Coolrebel> There's a warning on an incinerator. 
18:46 < matbee> isaacs, nobody has ever pointed their fully automatic rifle at me while I coded. I have when I worked at this specific incinerator.
18:46 <@isaacs> matbee: holy shit
18:46 <@konobi> matbee: o.O
18:46 <@isaacs> matbee: what were you doing?
18:46 < CoverSlide|Work> details!
18:46 < Coolrebel> 95% of 0 up front decreasing with milestones works for me
18:46 < CoverSlide|Work> as long as i set the milestones
18:46 < jb_> one mans work is another mans ease
18:46 < matbee> it was a medical waste incinerator, we burned a lot of confiscated drugs.
18:47 < CoverSlide|Work> 3 months: "Hello world"
18:47 <@konobi> CoverSlide|Work: heh
18:47 < matbee> One time there was a huge drug bust, and we had to roast a 40ft trailer FULL of marijuana
18:47 <@isaacs> matbee: jeez.
18:47 < matbee> so they shut down the road, blocked off every entrance/exit with 3 armed guards
18:47 < matbee> and i had 3 guards follow me every step.
18:47 < s5fs> matbee: i saw that movie!
18:47 < Coolrebel> I'm losing track of time
18:47 < Coolrebel> how do you guys get any work done
18:47 <@isaacs> matbee: that is definitely "real work"
18:47 < s5fs> Coolrebel: we work around the clock
18:47 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: that's just it, WE DONT WORK WE JUST MAKE COMPUTERS DO ALL THE WORK
18:48 < tnorris> Coolrebel: stay up till 3am. coding is a lifestyle, not a job.
18:48 < matbee> isaacs, ALSO it was 12hr shifts, 40c temperatures
18:48 < matbee> haha
18:48 < CoverSlide|Work> Coolrebel: I troll on irc and get paid for about 10 lines of code per day
18:48 < jrajav> ^
18:48 < jrajav> Me too
18:48 <@konobi> matbee: sounds kinda crazy for rcmp
18:48 < s5fs> i'm refactoring s i'm getting paid for removing loc
18:48 < matbee> konobi, wasn't rcmp, it was ETF
18:48 < ako> 10 lines of code which end up in production is pretty average, actually
18:49 < jrajav> Oh, uh I mean... My code is compiling. Yeah.
18:49 < Coolrebel> how often do assholes like me come around asking dumb questions about startups?
18:49 < s5fs> jrajav: swordfight!
18:49 < jrajav> I want to go back to working with C++ just so I can still use that excuse :(
18:49 < s5fs> Coolrebel: in here, i don't see them often. i personally get at least one email per week from someone looking for unpaid help.
18:49 <@konobi> matbee: ah
18:49 < matbee> LinkedIn is where all my spam happens
18:49 < ryanrolds> CoverSlide, you aren't actually a troll you just get paid to play one on IRC.
18:50 < matbee> If i go to tech meetups, when peopel find out I dev, they throw business cards at me-- and most of them are funded.
18:50 < Coolrebel> I'm not looking for free help. I been down that line. it don't work.
18:50 < s5fs> Coolrebel: future equity == free
18:50 < Coolrebel> If they're funded, then how important are CTO's to getting the funding?
18:50 < matbee> Coolrebel, they HAVE CTO's
18:50 < matbee> lol
18:51 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: you are much more reputable if you can code a little.  that's why i'm making a case for it.
18:51 < Coolrebel> The assumption is that every startup must be tech driven by under 26 year olds
18:51 < matbee> Some of them are accepted into incubators/accelerators and need a CTO to join
18:51 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: you don't have to be young.
18:51 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: but you do have to be flexible, and persistent, and willing to learn.
18:51 < CoverSlide|Work> If you're not young you need experience
18:51 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: and if you are those things, then coding is easy to learn.
18:51 < Coolrebel> Isaacs: I am - which is why I'm here
18:52 < matbee> If you're not "young" you just need passion
18:52 < Coolrebel> But even if id did know how to code
18:52 < CoverSlide|Work> LA PASION
18:52 < Coolrebel> I'd still never be able to pull off what the JS guy told me this project needed
18:52 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: time-box it.  give yourself 8 hours to dilligently work thorugh http://jsforcats.com/
18:52 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: give yourself a lunch break, even.
18:53 < jrajav> Most "young" people already have 10+ years experience of coding
18:53 < iksik2> ;D
18:53 < lohkey> Coolrebel: there are plenty of people that have raise half a million in funding and don't have any technical founders
18:53 < jrajav> I know plenty of 30, 40, 50 year old programmers that don't have that
18:53 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: forget about even writing a proof of concept, just try to strip some of the "magic" off your view of coding, and change your opinion of what you can and cannot do.
18:53 < CoverSlide|Work> i have 5 cats, wonder how they'd do
18:53 < jrajav> Don't rely on preconceptions pulled in from other lines of work
18:53 < s5fs> CoverSlide|Work: if they form a study group, probably pretty well
18:53 <@isaacs> Incidentally, http://jsforcats.com/ doesn't really appeal to actual cats much.  my cats were not that interested in it.
18:53 < CoverSlide|Work> maybe one can work for you!
18:53 < Coolrebel> isaacs: I'll do that. that looks like a good site
18:53 < Coolrebel> the cat thing
18:54 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: If you get distracted or confused or lose the thread of it, come here and tell mbalho (max ogden)
18:54 < s5fs> Coolrebel: write some code, then folks will view you on a peer level. that's an excellent start.
18:54 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: he's one of the nicest guys in open source.
18:54 < Coolrebel> isaacs: it really means that much to you guys?
18:54 < s5fs> and he has an excelelnt beard
18:55 < jrajav> I think beards are 95% of a good tech startup
18:55 < s5fs> jrajav: building a good team is hard, but if you follow common stereotypes you can do a bang-up job.
18:55 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: would you work for someone who had an idea for a paint brush company, and had never painted, even once, ever?
18:55 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: or a restaurant idea, but had never cooked even onemeal, and routinely burned soup?
18:56 < CoverSlide|Work> That is another good question, what is your experience?
18:56 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: "I can't code, and need someone who can" == "I lack persistence, motivation, and the ability to execute, and want someone else to do the work."
18:56 < Coolrebel> My experience is writing, film, journalism (way back in Londonwhere I'm from)
18:57 < matbee> Gahhhh, so you don't know ANY developers willing to help?
18:57 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: a lot of media/writing folks make very competent programmers.  look at Jacob Thornton
18:57 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: (aka @fat)
18:57 < s5fs> Coolrebel: so like, how do you feed yourself currently?
18:57 < Coolrebel> Isaacs: i get it. it's okay. just answer my question. If i knew code would you guys take me seriously?
18:57 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: I'd take you less un-seriously.
18:57 < s5fs> Coolrebel: yes, coding experience helps build cred.
18:57 <@isaacs> Coolrebel: :)
18:57 <@konobi> Coolrebel: it'd be a start =0)
18:58 < superjoe> Coolrebel, getting funding is another way to be taken seriously
18:58 < ryanrolds> Coolrebel, If you know a bit of programming we wouldn't be having this conversation
18:58 < Coolrebel> hahah
18:58 < Coolrebel> I'm enjoying this conversation
18:58 < CoverSlide|Work> not sure if node is a good start for a beginner
18:58 < CoverSlide|Work> javascript itself can be a bit rough
18:59 < s5fs> i agree
18:59 < EyePulp> Coolrebel: you don't have to have the skills, but it helps to be good at identifying/convincing those that do to partner with you.
18:59 < ryanrolds> Coolrebel, Do you know how often someone with an "idea" pops on to IRC channels like this looking for someone to do the work for them?
18:59 < Coolrebel> I'm here on nodejs irc bc a dev went through what we needed and said we needed this
18:59 < Zitter> I'm sending JSON data from Arduino to node.js. I have this error, using socket.io:  debug - destroying non-socket.io upgrade Now it seems it isn't possible to use socket.io client on arduino. So, is there another way to read that JSON data and print on console.log?
18:59 < ryanrolds> Coolrebel, A lot.
18:59 < gildean> CoverSlide|Work: it's a good start imo, it quite simple in most ways but you actually have to learn some things
19:00 < Coolrebel> ryanrolds: I'm not askingi anyone to do the work unless they're paid
19:00 < CoverSlide|Work> ryanrolds: there's lots more on craigslist
19:00 < Coolrebel> I wouldn't do that
19:00 < ryanrolds> Work is work, doesn't matter if their paid or not.
19:00 < Coolrebel> I'm asking for someone who knows their shit to partner up so that when we get the money we both get paid
19:00 < matbee> Zitter, hmm -- I didn't even know socket.io would work on an arduino?
19:00 < s5fs> Zitter: i'm doing similar work with arduinos and node.js (on embedded stuffs)
19:00 <@konobi> also, don't expect anyone to sign an NDA and especially a non-compete
19:00 < Cronoh> point being: this is generally a help channel for people using the language, not a looking for work spot
19:00 < matbee> NDA's will get you laughed at
19:01 < s5fs> Zitter: however, i'm using serial to comm with the arduino, then using node to shoot data to the client over socket.io
19:01 < Coolrebel> cronoh: i realize that
19:01 < Zitter> I would like to use Ethernet
19:01 < EyePulp> Coolrebel: you're asking for someone to take a risk on you.
19:01 < s5fs> matbee: NDAs are par for the course where I'm at (contracting, defense, medical)
19:01 < ryanrolds> Coolrebel, Go post on one of the freelancer web sites like gun.io and see what happens.
19:01 < Coolrebel> Eyepulp: Not really
19:01  * EyePulp doesn't even know what we're talking about at this point, so ignore him. =)
19:01 < Coolrebel> ryanrolds: if i was going to do that, would I be here?
19:01 <@konobi> s5fs: for employment sure
19:02 < s5fs> Zitter: okay so you've got an arduino with an ethernet shield then?
19:02 <@isaacs> Cronoh: this is not *just* a looking for help stop.
19:02 < ryanrolds> Coolrebel, Are you having a problem with Node.js that we can help you with?
19:02 <@isaacs> this is a place for noders to node about node things
19:02 < Zitter> my prb is how to send data from arduino to node.js. There is a websocket client library for Arduino, but on socket.io server it responds: "Destroying non-socket-io upgrade"
19:02 < Zitter> s5fs, yes
19:02 <@konobi> mbalho == max?
19:02 <@isaacs> konobi: yeah
19:02 < Cronoh> thats why i said generally, isaacs
19:02 < s5fs> Zitter: i haven't used the socket client for arduino
19:02 <@konobi> why didn't i clock that
19:03 <@isaacs> mbalho : max ogden :: izs : isaac schlueter
19:03 < Zitter> ok
19:03 <@isaacs> konobi: he has a lot of names :)
19:03 < dook> Is there an ideal app-flow for querying multiple services, and saving all the data at once?  How to know when all the queries have been completed, when they're all asynchronous?
19:03 < Coolrebel> Look, I won't waste your time. I learned a great deal during this chat - And I thank you. 
19:03 < ryanrolds> Is Max's middle name Balh?
19:03 <@konobi> isaacs: none if which you can ever mention in polite company
19:03 <@isaacs> maxwell benjamin abraham leonides herb ogden, iirc
19:03 < s5fs> Zitter: if it were my project i'd just use an existing arduino http server and push/pull json back to the node server.
19:03 < ryanrolds> haha.
19:03 < ryanrolds> herb
19:03 < matbee> s5fs, I refused to sign a contract at my current job with a non-compete
19:04 < gkatsev> and the award to longest name goes to:
19:04 <@konobi> matbee: they're generally un-enforceable here in BC
19:04 < s5fs> matbee: i've got various non-competes but usually it's pretty specific to a given industry or project.
19:04 < ryanrolds> Please tell he has a suffix like "the 5th"
19:04 < gabrieluk> css/html ninja, lol http://gun.io/careers/2050/css-html-ninja
19:04 < s5fs> matbee: enforcement is usually a pita though
19:04 < Zitter> s5fs, I can use this solution too: http://androidtoys.net/2012/10/remote-logging-with-arduino-and-node-js/ send it as UDP data, and then elaborate on node.js server to websocket them to all clients
19:05 < Zitter> but I would prefer websocket on both side
19:05  * isaacs has refused jobs on the basis that they wanted a non-compete
19:05 < s5fs> Zitter: why websockets on both sides?
19:05 <@konobi> Coolrebel: also, the whole "friend of a friend" network is usually where one would expect to go first
19:05 < s5fs> i usually refuse jobs based on commute or culture
19:05 <@isaacs> thye are unenforcible in CA for most things, but they show that the company has a bad attitude, imo.
19:06 < Zitter> because the next step is to control arduino from node
19:06 < s5fs> Zitter: sure, but you can do that w/o websockets.
19:06 < gkatsev> Zitter: you can control an arduino from node already, no?
19:07 <@konobi> my consulting contract has explicit wording about clients not expecting non-compete clauses to be accepted
19:07 < Zitter> anyway, maybe the right solution is to follow that tut on send data in UDP and then manipulate on server
19:07 < gabrieluk> noduino?
19:07 < CoverSlide|Work> I once applied for a job at a client of my then-current employer when they were considering not renewing their contract
19:07 < s5fs> Zitter: a simple http api would be a good start
19:07 < CoverSlide|Work> I could have gotten it too but they couldn't pay what i asked for
19:07 < gkatsev> gabrieluk: that's what I was thinking of
19:07 < Zitter> gkatsev, no. The first step is to change a potentiometer on arduino and change background color on browser :)
19:07 < s5fs> Zitter: the udp solution only works from arduino->node, not in reverse
19:07 < Zitter> yes but it is only solution I've found
19:08 < s5fs> Zitter: lemme see if i can find you a link closer to my idea
19:08 < Zitter> thanks :)
19:08 <@konobi> Zitter: looked at firmata?
19:08 < gkatsev> Zitter: oh, so arduino->node
19:08 < s5fs> Zitter: really its the arduino side that's tricky. once you get that working you shoudl be able to connect node easily
19:09 < Zitter> not yet... noduino didn't convince me
19:09 < s5fs> gkatsev: I'm hearing arduino<->node
19:09 < gabrieluk> gkatsev, yeap http://semu.github.com/noduino/
19:09 < red5> anyone can help me? -> Error: SSL Error: Hostname/IP doesn't match certificate's altnames   
19:09 < red5> using npm 
19:10 < s5fs> Zitter: what about http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/WebServer
19:10 < gkatsev> looks like noduino has listeners to arduino events
19:10 < Zitter> yes I've looked Noduino but it doesn't look so pratical
19:10 < s5fs> Zitter: if you can create your own simple web server, then you can accept requests and respond with whatever you want
19:10 < s5fs> Zitter: http is also nice because you arne't bound to a single node process, and other arduinos could talk amongst themselves
19:10 < Zitter> s5fs, yes. But first step is to read a sensor and then send data to node.js
19:10 < Zitter> so, I need a client at first
19:11 < s5fs> Zitter: haha, right, but you're glossing over the "how send data to node" part
19:11 < s5fs> i'm proposing a solution to sending the data to node
19:11 < Zitter> after that, node.js has to transmit sensor data to all clients using websocket
19:11 < s5fs> Zitter: right, that part i get
19:11 < Zitter> yeah, but clients are browsers... not arduinos :D
19:12 < s5fs> Zitter: in my mind, the node process should query the arduino for updated sensor readings, then communicate those readings to socket.io clients
19:12 < Zitter> ah, ok. 
19:12 < Zitter> no, don't like that solution.
19:12 < s5fs> Zitter: the arduino (since it already has an ethernet shield) should provide a ghetto restful api or whatever for easy querying
19:13 < s5fs> Zitter: any particular reason why that approach is unfavorable?
19:13 < gkatsev> Zitter: using noduino is less practical than rolling your own? What?
19:13 < Zitter> gkatsev, I have gave it a try, didn't like. Anyway a second chance is near to come :)
19:13 < s5fs> noduino looks sick
19:14 < Zitter> yeah, to me too...
19:14 < matbee> why not arduinode?
19:14 < Zitter> arduinode is new, thanks matbee 
19:14 < s5fs> Zitter: my current dorkaround project is a temp sensor puking data over bluetooth to a laptop, which then scoops that data up and transmit it via socket.io to web clients
19:14 < gkatsev> Zitter: lol
19:15 < Zitter> s5fs, almost same project :)
19:15 < s5fs> Zitter: my work gig is a udp server that pukes data to a node process, which then scoops up that data and transmits it via socket.io to web clients
19:15 < s5fs> instrumentation only comes in a few flavors
19:16 < gkatsev> Zitter: I think you should either make noduino better, if the stuff you dont like are minor. But yeah, if you don't like the whole architecture, I guess you need to make your own.
19:16 < Zitter> gkatsev, no I've said that it has a second chance :)
19:17 < gkatsev> Zitter: yeah, just saying. :)
19:17 < Zitter> matbee, but arduinonde works only with wireless sensor?
19:18 < s5fs> Zitter: arduinode appears to solve a different problem
19:18 < Zitter> yep
19:18 < matbee> oh i was just talking about a name
19:19 < Zitter> :)
19:19 < matbee> i didnt clarify, just brain dump
19:19 < matbee> i was wonderign why noduino instead of arduinode, it rolls of the tongue/eyes better
19:19 < s5fs> Zitter: i prefer to keep components separate (where possible). my approach would be to write the code to poll the sensor(s) and manage the state. then i'd work on exposing that data to the world via some network-accessible service. then i'd begin the node.js integration.
19:20 < s5fs> Zitter: i prefer to write simulators when working with network servers though, keeps testing easy, but that's me.
19:20 < s5fs> it's also easier to change your work-in-progress protocol in javascript than to go back to the arduino.
19:21 < Zitter> ok, thanks for all.
19:21 < s5fs> Zitter: good luck!
19:21 < Zitter> thanks :)
19:23 < CoverSlide|Work> for something as high-perfomance as haproxy, the website sure is dog slow
19:23 < CoverSlide|Work> not to mention the git repo
19:25 < Martin____> Hello there
19:26 < Martin____> I was wondering if it is possible to tell node to run one module always in harmony mode?
19:27 < Martin____> In order to not require the same from referencing modules
19:27 < CoverSlide|Work> I don't think so, I think the engine is either in harmony mode or not, you can't just do it for one module
19:28 < Martin____> hmm, how uncomfortable. Okay: other question: Is there a socially accepted way to deal with Maps?
19:29 < zezikaro> Hi, is there any way of doing reflectoin woith javascript i norder to automatically discover javascript components
19:29 < CoverSlide|Work> maybe wait until they're standardized, and then we can have some best practices, since they haven't been used in the wild yet
19:29 < jcrew_> zezikaro: are you just looking for functions belonging to a component?
19:29 < Martin____> Well: I am talking more about "faking" maps.
19:30 < jonathanochs> What should I pay a good node.js dev hourly?
19:30 < CoverSlide|Work> faking maps? name your use case where Object isn't enough
19:30 < CoverSlide|Work> The ES.next wiki has a shim for Maps but it's not pretty
19:30 < Martin____> I have seen https://github.com/flesler/hashmap but it modifies objects :-/
19:31 < CoverSlide|Work> it just uses arrays and indexOf
19:31 < zezikaro> jcrew_ I'm writing a 'centralised component' which should be composed of lots of other components which i'll register through reflection
19:31 < CoverSlide|Work> O(n) ftw!
19:31 < zezikaro> jcrew_ So, an example might be some sort of factory
19:31 < CoverSlide|Work> Martin____: like I said, name your use case where Object isn't enough
19:31 < Martin____> I want to remember whether or not I analysed an object in a tree
19:31 < zezikaro> I have a factory which can offer components which it found through reflection
19:31 < jcrew_> zezikaro: there isn't a way to get the argument list (reliably), but you can iterate through objects like arrays to figure out what is in them
19:31 < CoverSlide|Work> Martin____: then wouldn't you want a Set?
19:32 < zezikaro> jcrew_ how can i automatically detect all modules though?
19:32 < Martin____> A set would do to... but that is also part of harmony right?
19:32 < tnorris> Martin____: yeah, you can enable that with `node --harmony`
19:32 < CoverSlide|Work> right
19:33 < CoverSlide|Work> Array and indexOf would be the best way to do that
19:33 < Martin____> The problem is that I want to write a library/framework and if I required --harmony then all the users need to activate that too...
19:33 < CoverSlide|Work> like i said, it's not very optimized
19:34 < CoverSlide|Work> Martin____: well you can detect for harmony features and throw
19:34 < tnorris> Martin____: well, you could write a wrapper that checks for Set. then uses it if it exists.
19:34 < CoverSlide|Work> if(typeof Map == 'undefined') throw "Use --harmony bitch!"
19:34 < Martin____> @CoverSlide @tnorris thanks for your input: I will do that!
19:34 < tnorris> and just mention in your docs that using `--harmony` will result in better perf and smaller mem footprint
19:35 < tnorris> CoverSlide: lol, that is awesome.
19:35 < jcrew_> zezikaro: put the components into a "namespace"
19:35 < iksik2> zezikaro: perhaps using some dedicated 'namespace' would do the trick?
19:35 < iksik2> erm..
19:35 < zezikaro> what can i google for an example?
19:36 < fla86> looking for an experienced node dev for the lead developer position for a new startup. PM for more details
19:36 < zezikaro> you don't mean the global object i presume
19:36 < CoverSlide|Work> hm well that's shitty, es.next's Set spec uses maps
19:36 < CoverSlide|Work> i guess a map would do then
19:36 < CoverSlide|Work> but i guess it depends on the engine
19:36 < addisonj_> okay, another http agent question, from the docs I understand that connections stay open as long as there is another request to that host:port that is queued up waiting for a socket, but is there any timeout to that? does the socket stay open for like 5 seconds waiting for a connection
19:37 < addisonj_> ?
19:37 < iksik2> zezikaro: if your namespace exists inside of your 'centralised component' then no, it would not be global, but it could be used by your factory method -_-
19:38 < zezikaro> iksik2 the components will be in separate javascript files
19:39 < Martin____> (Sidenote) i like the documentation of Map: "In Firefox 18 and earlier, size was a method.  In Firefox 19 and later it is a property." https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map
19:40 < tacirus> why when I execute in a browser a simple code like response.write("hello world") the first time it work fine the massage is there . then I change the words in the code file , reload the browser page but the old massage is shown not the new one?
19:40 < tacirus> message*
19:40 < iksik2> zezikaro: so... MyMastahComponent.register('someInternalAliasOrNameFromPackageJson', require('./helloWorldComponent')); where register is something like: register (localAlis, functionRefReturnedByRequire) { myLocalNamespace[localAlias] = functionRefReturnedByRequire; }
19:41 < iksik2> sorry for loong names :P
19:41 < zezikaro> iksik2 What if I change 'MyMastahComponent's implementation?
19:41 < zezikaro> with that suggesting we've tightly coupled the two parts
19:41 < jcrew_> zezikaro: then you need to either make it backwards compatible or not and it will break plugins
19:41 < zezikaro> and what if two factories want access to the same component
19:42 < zezikaro> should that one component register itself with both?
19:42 < zezikaro> is there a way for the factory to search for components?
19:42 < jcrew_> no, it can use reflection on the mastah's components namespace
19:42 < eleith> @isaacs wanted to see if there was interest in a 'skip-if-installed' feature for npm. our dev environment process runs a set of npm install commands when we switch branches, but it hits the network for each install request when most of the time, we already have the node modules installed and just need the deployment to move ahead
19:42 < tnorris> Martin____: my favorite thing about Set (and Map, etc) is that the key can be anything, not just a string. Great for checking event queues and the like.
19:42 < jcrew_> the factory will have access to master's components
19:43 < eleith> i saw rvagg had a pull request with this in mind, but he closed it a month ago after building checks into ender itself to avoid this
19:43 < Martin____> tnorris: I am just writing a shim for Map on non-harmony ... i wonder if I am the first one who did that...
19:44 < tnorris> Martin____: nope. let me get you the link.
19:44 < Benvie> https://github.com/Benvie/harmony-collections
19:44 < tnorris> Martin____: https://github.com/paulmillr/es6-shim/
19:44 < Martin____> Or is it a polyfill ... I always mix those two words
19:44 < CoverSlide|Work> wonderful, .size is not even in harmony
19:45 < Benvie> yes it is
19:45 < Benvie> it's an accessor though
19:45 < tnorris> v8 hasn't fully implemented the latest spec.
19:45 < CoverSlide|Work> Benvie: show me the docs
19:45 < tnorris> you shouldn't be able to initiate a Set using an array, but not possible right now.
19:46 < CoverSlide|Work> http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:simple_maps_and_sets << doesn't mention size
19:46 < Martin____> okay ... two libraries ... which one is "better" ;)
19:46 < Benvie> http://benvie.github.com/es-spec-html/#sec-15.14.5.10
19:46 < iksik2> zezikaro: also, You can take a look into 'architect' module from c9 (afair), and google for this second one - which i can't remember the name right now :D
19:46 < addisonj_> wow, the httpAgent doesn't do much other than prevent unbounded socket growth does it, you chance of reuse only goes up as you queue up connections...
19:46 < Benvie> and implementation http://benvie.github.com/continuum/
19:46 < jcrew_> zezikaro: i'm writing up a gist too
19:46 < tnorris> Martin____: that's the repo I meant to post. give me a moment to find it.
19:47 < tnorris> Martin____: here we go: https://github.com/Benvie/continuum
19:47 < Benvie> https://github.com/Benvie/continuum/blob/gh-pages/builtins/%40map.js
19:48 < CoverSlide|Work> oops, i guess i've been going off the wiki
19:48 < CoverSlide|Work> not a big fan of reading pdfs
19:48 < Benvie> MapData https://github.com/Benvie/continuum/blob/gh-pages/engine/runtime.js#L963
19:49 < Martin____> CoverSlide, Benvie, tnorris: I will go with es6-shim for now, seems most robust
19:50 < Benvie> it's not, this one is http://benvie.github.com/harmony-collections/
19:50 < Benvie> I mean it's ok but it's not really spec compliant even remotely (es6-shim) nor does it implement WeakMap in a reasonably useful way
19:50 < point9repeating> does anyone have a recommendation for dealing with timezones? node-time looks well used
19:50 < Benvie> or at all maybe
19:51 < Benvie> there's also this which is stripped down just for WeakMap https://github.com/Benvie/WeakMap
19:51 < Martin____> Harmony collections tries to implement a WeakMap... sounds fishy to me, so does the few unit tests. Why should it be better than es6-shim?
19:52 < jrajav> Why should we write new programming languages and libraries at all, ever? We've already coded a few hundred universal Turing machines
19:52 < jrajav> ;)
19:52 < Benvie> es6-shim uses an O(n) lookup
19:52 < Benvie> it's basically a glorified array using indexOf
19:53 < Benvie> harmony-collections provides O(1) lookup times, that factor alone is enough to make a huge difference
19:54 < jrajav> One day I'm going to write a library that gets as popular as jQuery
19:54 < jrajav> But instead of $ it will use O
19:54 < Martin____> The alternative would be to store a index in the anonymous object ... which is a breach of contract.
19:54 < iksik2> haha
19:54 < CoverSlide|Work> how is O(1) possible? wouldn't it be at least O(log n)?
19:54 < Zelest> If I include a module through require(), can I somewhat get the IP of a client connecting to the http server or do I have to send it as an argument when I include it?
19:54 < Benvie> for key -> value lookups it's O(1)
19:54 < Benvie> it doesn't search anything
19:55 < cxreg> is mranney not working on node-redis anymore?  there's a ton of open pull reqs
19:55 < Martin____> According to contract Map.set(key, value) modifies neither the key nor the value. Right?
19:55 < jcrew_> zezikaro: https://gist.github.com/4236002
19:56 < Benvie> the specification doesn't prescribe implementation, it just prescribes the result
19:56 < Martin____> So: A WeakMap that does modify the key would not be keeping the contract and thus be dangerous in a complex enviroment.
19:56 < Benvie> no
19:56 < Benvie> a WeakMap says this: for any key that is reachable, the value is reachable
19:56 < Martin____> I am pretty sure that the definition of Map/WeakMap says that the input may not be modified.
19:57 < Lee-> Benvie, what abuot collisions? I don't see how a key->value lookup can be O(1) unless it allocates a ton of memory such that there can never be a collision
19:57 < zezikaro> jcrew_ thanks
19:57 < Benvie> it says that being a key or value in a WeakMap does not have an impact on garbage collectability
19:58 < Martin____> sam
19:58 < jcrew_> zezikaro: np, you could get fancy with it too and call the 'reflect' function when something is added to the 'component' object
19:58 < jcrew_> the example does it manually
19:59 < cpsubrian> I have a fairly lenghty (long-running) CLI that I'm getting an EventEmitter leak on.  Its coming from line 134 in realine.js, which is a `once()` binding on `self`.  In this case `self` is the `Interface` function.  Not sure how I can raise max listeners.. how to access the right object to set it on?
19:59 < cpsubrian> readline*
19:59 < Benvie> there is one situation in which the WeakMap shim fails
19:59 < Martin____> Benvie: All you are saying is true: but still: storing a new property in the object, even if its "hidden" is afaik a no-go.
19:59 < Benvie> but that situation almost exclusively shows up when using Proxies, in which case you have native WeakMaps
19:59 < exit2> Would it be frowned upon to use mustache and els?
19:59 < Benvie> well it's a shim
19:59 < tnorris> Martin____: just ran a bunch of benchmarks and using an Object lookup over a Set in v8 uses less memory and is faster (a lot faster for very large objects).
19:59 < exit2> *ejs..
20:00 < Benvie> if you want WeakMaps that are perfectly implemented then you get the engine to do it
20:00 < Benvie> it's close enough
20:00 < tnorris> the v8 implementation still has a lot to be desired.
20:00 < CoverSlide|Work> exit2: use whatever engine you want dude
20:00 < tnorris> one one huge advantage of a Set is that keys point to memory addresses. so you can place anything in as the key.
20:00 < jcrew_> zezikaro: what are you designing?
20:00 < exit2> CoverSlide|Work: I'm saying at the same time
20:00 < CoverSlide|Work> exit2: i just recommend use one that is actively maintained
20:00 < Martin____> close enough is okay for a project, not for a library imho.
20:01 < CoverSlide|Work> exit2: may get kludgy, but no reason you can't
20:01 < Benvie> that's for you to decide
20:01 < CoverSlide|Work> exit2: although i don't think you can mix layouts if you're using express
20:01 < CoverSlide|Work> cause layouts are implemented by the engine now, not express
20:01 < CoverSlide|Work> express 2.x i think you could do
20:02 < CoverSlide|Work> but otherwise you can just render one and inject the rendered output into the other
20:02 < tnorris> heck, the v8 implementation is so incomplete the return value for .set() is a string that says "undefined", not just undefined...
20:04 < Martin____> tnorris: wtf ...
20:04 < exit2> does npm have an option to delete dependencies if you remove them from your package.json?
20:05 < Azra-el> Hi guys. I'm looking for somebody who can consult me if possible. with or without pay because right now i'm lost. I've tested my server (wip) with ab just now and it keeps hanging even at 100 concurency with 1000 total... what the hell am i doing wrong?
20:05 < Azra-el> and from what i understand this sholdnt be the case so it clearly must be something that im doing wrong
20:05 <@konobi> isaacs: btw... the docs link on npmjs homepage is incorrect
20:06 < iain_> Azra-el: 100 concurrency is a lot
20:06 < iksik2> zezikaro: https://github.com/c9/architect - some nice ideas -_-
20:06 < iain_> though I don't know what your server is like
20:06 < iain_> in terms of processing power etc
20:06 < gildean> exit2: you can just command npm remove <modulename>
20:06 < iain_> or what your app is doing
20:07 < iain_> Azra-el: can you do 1-10 concurrency just fine?
20:07 < gildean> Azra-el: maybe your code is too synchronous
20:07 <@konobi> exit2: npm prune
20:07 < iain_> and what kind of load do you get?
20:07 < Azra-el> iain_ ... ab hangs... the app is just querying mongodb. the same app in flask doesnt hang. and no .. i dont think i have any sync code there .... 
20:08 < iain_> Azra-el: you need to have stats on the server to gain any insight to the problem
20:08 < iain_> if you have dtrace available, use that if you can
20:09 < iain_> Azra-el: or it could be the machine you are doing the test from that has the problem
20:10 < jw___> what is the best way to set ulimit for nodejs process
20:10 < jw___> what is the optimal value
20:10 < CoverSlide|Work> unlimited
20:10 < Azra-el> well... im new at testing... (im pretty new to nodejs too ). and it barely handles 10 concurency. and dtrace is not isntalled but i think i can do it. i dont think its the machine.. i double checked it with an instance on rackspace.. .and it works flawlessly for the same app in uwsgi / flask
20:10 < tnorris> yeah. it's really lagging behind. looking at the repo, looks like the implementation hasn't been touched for about a year.
20:10 < tnorris> Martin____: ^
20:11 < jw___> @CoverSlidelWork how do you set the limit permanetly
20:11 < iain_> if it can't handle -c10, its likely you have either as another said - too much syncronous stuff - or just a crappy server
20:11 < iain_> or bad code
20:11 < jw___> I think unlimited is not smart since you have limited amount of ports so if there are no ports you will need to reboot the server in order to connect to it
20:12 < iain_> jw___: you set it via sysctl on linux/bsd
20:12 < Azra-el> that's why im trying to get a counsel.. a mentor if you will... id like for somebody to glance over the code (its really not much ) and at least tell me if there are any obviously dumb things. i dont think they are because most of it i got from reading and adapting tutorials
20:12 < CoverSlide|Work> jw___: what os?
20:12 < jw___> @iain are you talking about file-max?
20:12 < jw___> ubuntu 12.04 LTS
20:13 < CoverSlide|Work> jw___: /etc/security/limits.conf
20:13 < iain_> Azra-el: I'm not a javascript expert, but it sounds like you've got bigger problems on your hands
20:13 < CoverSlide|Work> but i think you have to relog in to take effect
20:13 < CoverSlide|Work> or maybe just exec into a new shell
20:13 < CoverSlide|Work> can't remember
20:14 < iain_> jw___: maybe, I've not had to change the setting in a very very long time
20:14 < Azra-el> iain_.. which is?
20:14 < iain_> Azra-el: what are you doing your testing on?
20:14 < jw___> @CovreSlid|Works for example   node    soft  nofile 63535
20:14 < iain_> you compared it to rackspace and rackspace worked ok....?
20:14 < jw___> what ulimit -n do you guys use
20:15 < Azra-el> iain_... the app is running on a vps (2 cores, 3gb ram) and the tests were run from a personal computer and from a rackspace 1gb instance
20:15 < iain_> jw___: I just use default, not had to change it in 5 years
20:15 < jw___> @iain the default is like 1024
20:15 < jw___> it limits you to 1024 parallel connections
20:15 < jw___> that's really low
20:16 < iain_> jw___: and I've hardly ever had to change it, even on production machines
20:16 <@konobi> 65k
20:16 < gildean> Azra-el: well gist the code up and i'm sure some of us will look at it
20:16 < acidjazz> if im in a module w/ a bunch of exports.funcname.. is it possible to call one of these exports.funcname w/in the module?
20:16 < jw___> people use 63k just to make sure it does not overflow the available number of ports
20:16 < CoverSlide|Work> iain_: that all depends on the type of site and the kind of traffic
20:16 < iain_> CoverSlide|Work: aye
20:17 <@konobi> good ol c10k
20:17 < jw___> @CoverSlide|Works That's true if you use socket.io you would be really limited with 1024
20:17 < gildean> acidjazz: yes, the verbose way is to say var someFunc = function() {}; exports.someFunc = someFunc;
20:17 < CoverSlide|Work> if you have a basic webserver with no persistent stuff i.e. websockets or polling, 1024 might be enough
20:17 < jw___> @konobi are you using 65k
20:17 < CoverSlide|Work> module.exports  = someFunct; function someFunc(){} << Name your functions!
20:18 < CoverSlide|Work> unless you like seeing (anonymous) line:35 in your stact traces
20:18 < jw___> if you are running mikimouse server than yea 1k is enough
20:20 < acidjazz> gildean: is that the only way?
20:20 < acidjazz> gildean: i cant just exports.someFunc() inside an exports.someOtherFunc(); ?
20:21 <@konobi> jw___: have done
20:21 < CoverSlide|Work> acidjazz: you can do that
20:21 < CoverSlide|Work> although honestly the first way is better
20:21 < CoverSlide|Work> why do you want to traverse the exports object for each call?
20:22 < CoverSlide|Work> even though it's one level and probably optimized anyway
20:22 < CoverSlide|Work> that always isn't a guarantee
20:22 <@konobi> jw___: you also have to remember that tcp ports have a timeout, so it's not just active connections that will use up an FD
20:22 <@konobi> and the 65k number is just a maximum number of fds for an individual process
20:42 < brianc> anyone know the amount of overhead a domain adds?
20:42 < brianc> thinking of working on a database transaction helper for node-postgres (in a different module) and was wondering if using 1 domain per transaction would kill performance
20:54 < exit2> can someone tell me why this router is not working? http://beta.pastie.org/5495701
20:57 < brianc> exit2: need to see more code than that. also, the comma after ensureAutehnticated on line 3....not sure what that's doing but you cannot assign a variable to 2 things separated by a comma
20:57 < exit2> brianc: I'm trying to attach that function to the view
20:58 < brianc> exit2: you need to export "ensureAuthenticated" and the route function as 2 different variables
20:58 < exit2> brianc: hmm might be easier to keep it all in app.js hah
20:58 < brianc> and then do something like `app.get('/account', routes.ensureAuthenticated, routes.getAccount)
20:58 < brianc> exit2: often if I break up my routes I'll pass the 'app' object to the file containing the routes
20:58 < brianc> exit2: one moment...making gist
20:59 < exit2> brianc: cool thanks
20:59 < brianc> exit2: https://gist.github.com/4236441
21:00 < exit2> brainc: my route is called auth.js
21:00 < brianc> exit2: another option which I believe tjholowaychuk mentioned a long time ago is actually making your 'app' object a global. But I've never done that myself.
21:00 < exit2> so I required auth = require('./routes/auth')
21:01 < exit2> and in app.'s I did: app.get('/account', routes.ensureAuthenticated, routes.auth);
21:01 < tjholowaychuk> brianc i retract that suggestion
21:01 < tjholowaychuk> haha
21:02 < exit2> tjholowaychuk: I'm trying to organize my views and routes because the app.js is getting pretty bloated and my OCD is forcing me to clean it up
21:03 < brianc> tjholowaychuk: haha okay cool i kinda figured you might have by now. i think it was like 2 years ago?
21:04 < tjholowaychuk> brianc it's not the end of the world, but it's definitely nicer to pass around specific options
21:04 < tjholowaychuk> uglier
21:04 < tjholowaychuk> but whatever
21:04 < brianc> agreed
21:04 < tjholowaychuk> node is ugly
21:04 < tjholowaychuk> so its not a big deal
21:04 < brianc> i never have had a nice experience with a global
21:04 < exit2> ah I think I fixed it
21:05 < brianc> "oh this is so easy using a global. I just fucked myself"
21:05 < exit2> brianc: your suggestion helped https://gist.github.com/4236510
21:06 < exit2> redirects with the ensureAuthenticated function
21:06 < brianc> exit2: yeah something like that. but you gonna wanna use 'var' in front of the auth variable
21:06 < exit2> brianc: yeah I just copied it from my list of other dependencies :P
21:06 < brianc> coolness
21:06 < exit2> thanks :)
21:07 < exit2> now I can clean it all up and have am auth route so my app.js isn't so fat
21:07 < brianc> no problemo
21:07 < matbee_> woopwoop
21:09 < exit2> ugh verizon fios site is so ugly
21:12 < simonwjackson> Hey everyone, I am a long time graphic designer looking to change careers over to frontend development. Before I dive in head first... Does anyone have advice/suggestions on what skills potential employers are looking for?
21:12 < exit2> simonwjackson: JavaScript :P
21:12 < exit2> simonwjackson: what kind of stuff do you hope to do at your potential employer?
21:14 < timkuijsten> isaacs: the new readable-stream 0.0.4 breaks with my code, it does not emit readable events on wrapped mongo streams. located the bug down to readable.js #603, the chunk that is received does not have a length (it's an object). in 0.0.3 this didn't prevent emitting the event
21:14 < simonwjackson> exit2: user interaction, stubtle animations, etc
21:14 < exit2> simonwjackson: do you know HTML and CSS?
21:14 < simonwjackson> exit2: and yes of course, javascript :)
21:15 < simonwjackson> exit2: quite well, yes
21:15 < exit2> simonwjackson: ok so you have the user interaction and subtle animation part down then
21:15 < eff> quelqu'un aurais des suggestions de config / pluggins pour editer du js avec emacs ?
21:16 < eff> wow, sorry it's late, didnt noticed it wasn't english,
21:16 < exit2> haha awesome
21:16 < eff> would someone have suggestions on configuration or addons for editing js with emacs ?
21:16 < iksik2> ;-D
21:16 < exit2> I wish my brain worked that way
21:16 < brianc> I wish my brain worked.
21:16 < iksik2> eff: replace emacs with sublime ;P
21:17 < eff> *dont feed it, dont feed it dont fee.... arrr too hard* emacs' better ! :P
21:17 < tnorris> then replace sublime with vim. ;-)
21:17 < brianc> eff: I used to use emacs for editing js
21:18 < brianc> eff: there's js2-mode and coffee-mode or something?
21:18 < brianc> eff: then I switched to vim and realized I was lost but now I am found
21:18 < iksik2> eff: you are weak! :P
21:18 < iksik2> tnorris: and if i'm using them both? :-)
21:18 < brianc> eff: or cappuchino-mode
21:19 < eff> there's the default js-mode the js2-mode from steve yegee, and a js3-mode, but it's hard to figure out which one is the most suited for node, overall js2 seems better but js3 support the coma first synthax :(
21:19 < brianc> iksik2: one cannot serve two masters
21:19 < tnorris> iksik2: do you have sublime in vim mode?
21:20 < iksik2> tnorris: no, sublime is... sublime ;-)
21:20 < brianc> eff: yeah, i tried writing a major-mode for emacs. it's no fun. but maybe you could hack on your js2-mode to support comma first?
21:20 < brianc> you could also ask in #emacs
21:20 < brianc> just like you get ridiculed here for using emacs, you will probably be ridiculed there for using javascript
21:21 < tnorris> iksik2: how do you go back to using the mouse and arrow keys? it makes me hurt inside when I do.
21:21 < tnorris> sublime has a "vintage mode" that allows for vi editing.
21:21 < brianc> tnorris: i actually can't. RSI starts to kick in after a few days
21:21 < jcrew_> sublime has a vim mode?
21:21 < eff> brianc: the coma first is not my first concern, there's the linting available for emacs with a node server, but i cant find an addon for a tab complemention (by introspecting objects)
21:21 < tnorris> yeah: http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/vintage.html
21:21 < brianc> eff: i don't think there is one
21:22 -!- mode/#node.js [+o piscisaureus_] by ChanServ
21:22 < iksik2> tnorris: well, i have moved from big IDEs like eclipse, etc... it is more natural for me - i think... but i work a lot under console, where vim is the best for me ;-)
21:22 < eff> but it doesnt seem that hard, as far as i can imagine, according the node prompt can do it :(
21:22 < brianc> eff: the node prompt can, yes. it is also running an entire v8 context. emacs is only running elisp
21:23 < tnorris> brianc: between vim and my swiftpoint mouse, my fingers never leave the home row.
21:23 < brianc> tnorris: same here. except for the 8 hours a day i use visual studio. *punches self in face*
21:23 < eff> brianc: i wouldn't mind having a node running in the background for the feature :)
21:23 < tnorris> brianc: oh the horror! job related?
21:24 < brianc> eff: but it would have to constantly reexecute and evaluate your code & it would break any time your code had a synxtax error. it's harder than it sounds
21:24 < brianc> tnorris: ya
21:24 < iksik2> tnorris: i admire people that can use keyboard only even when they can use mouse ;-)
21:24 < tnorris> iksik2: that's how I got into vim. worked as a jr sys admin and spent hours ssh'd to servers.
21:24 < tnorris> iksik2: heck, I even have vimium installed so I never have to use the mouse on my browsers.
21:24 < iksik2> ;-DD
21:25 < tnorris> brianc: wow, that must be horrible. so you work on a windows machine, and work in visual studio? that sounds like my own personal hell.
21:25 < brianc> tnorris: pretty much
21:26 < eff> why is there such a wild vim-node community and so few emacs zealote in this room ? :'(
21:26 < brianc> tnorris: the good side is a very small team so we don't do any "enterprisey" shit with C#. we just ship a bunch. it's still way worse than other platforms in a lot of ways, but you can't just completely overhaul architecture 
21:26 < iksik2> hah, i was forced to move into windows from linux desktop ;-D
21:27  * iksik2 also in hell -_-
21:27 < exit2> brainc: what instrument do you play in your band?
21:27 < brianc> sing + guitar + a lot of the aux instruments & drum programming
21:27 < badem4o-work> Hey guys and girls I have a question for you. I am trying to do some processing on a string with a RegExp and it is working just fine in the browser but in Node it is not. 
21:27 < exit2> brianc: pretty good stuff, reminds me of Brand New a bit
21:28 < badem4o-work> I have a variable : var test = '{{> _header}} body {{data.name}} {{> _footer}}';
21:28 < iksik2> tnorris: personally i can't force my self to use vim with default settings - for example managing copy/paste and lot of lines of code is still magic for me
21:28 < brianc> exit2: thanks.  I am the guy w/ glasses on the mic: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hevq1tkKMGs&feature=player_embedded
21:28 < exit2> brianc: not sure if you like Brand New so I hope that's not offensive :)
21:28 < badem4o-work> Let me try it in the same message
21:28 < tnorris> brianc: yeah. I can understand that. at my previous place I had to run a windows vm to get all my work done.
21:29 < brianc> tnorris: i will not work in another windows shop ever, but i not terribly disgruntled at my currnt job
21:29 < tnorris> iksik2: the shortcuts can be tricky. here's my example .vimrc: https://github.com/trevnorris/.vim
21:29 < brianc> we have some node & some ruby and a ton of client side JS
21:29 < iksik2> hmm, there could be some pathogen based and ready to use set of plugins to work with node, just after cloning some repo ;-D
21:30 < brianc> exit2: thanks. i haven't heard a lot of brand new actually
21:30 < tnorris> iksik2: but once you get used to it, you can even copy directly to your computer's clipboard. (V<movement>"+y)
21:30 < iksik2> uhm
21:31 < brianc> tnorris: did not know you could put +y at the end of a copy command. 
21:31 < iksik2> even when i'm using vim over putty?
21:31 < brianc> iksik2: no, running vim over putty you have to highlight the text in the window w/ the mouse afaik
21:31 < tnorris> brianc: heh, well as long as you can handle it. And I'm not even opposed to C#. Mono is an awesome project.
21:31 < iksik2> ok
21:31 < badem4o-work> Hey guys and girls I have a question for you. 
21:31 < badem4o-work> I am trying to do some processing on a string with a RegExp and it is working just fine in the browser but in Node it is not.
21:31 < badem4o-work> var test = '{{> _header}} body {{data.name}} {{> _footer}}';
21:31 < badem4o-work> var partials = { _header: "<header>Hi From The Header</header>", _footer: "<footer>Hi From The Footer</footer>"}
21:31 < badem4o-work> var reg = new RegExp('{{> (.*?)}}', 'g');
21:31 < badem4o-work> And then 
21:31 < badem4o-work> test.replace(reg, partials[RegExp.$1]); 
21:31 < badem4o-work> returns
21:31 < badem4o-work> "<footer>Hi From The Footer</footer> body {{data.name}} <footer>Hi From The Footer</footer>"
21:31 < badem4o-work> But in node partials[RegExp.$1] is coming back undefined.
21:31 < badem4o-work> Any Ideas or help will bu appreciated. Thanks.
21:32 < iksik2> wow :D
21:32 <@mbalho> badem4o-work: use gist.github.com please
21:32 < tnorris> iksik2: putty implies you're using windows, right?
21:32 < badem4o-work> mbalho: Ok give me a few seconds
21:32 < iksik2> tnorris: as i said above, i'm forced to use it right now, but i'm a linux guy ;-)
21:33 < tnorris> iksik2: ah, must have missed that. man, so many people forced to use windows. Luckily I've never had a job (4 and counting) that forced me to use windows as my primary os.
21:36 < iksik2> tnorris: ok, i'm testing your config -_-
21:37 < tnorris> iksik2: unless you have the entire thing loaded, it will break. and i'm not sure if the packages work in windows.
21:37 < badem4o-work> mbalho: https://gist.github.com/4236726
21:37 < iksik2> tnorris: i'm testing it under my local server (freebsd)
21:37 < badem4o-work> Can anyone help with this?
21:38 < iksik2> aaaand it breaks with your bash path - which is not /bin/bash under *bsd systems ;P
21:38 < tnorris> lol, sorry.
21:38 < iksik2> ;-)
21:39 < tnorris> badem4o-work: um, it's coming up as "undefined" in my browser.
21:39 < badem4o-work> uhm
21:39 < badem4o-work> let me try again
21:41 < iksik2> wow, red comments :D
21:41 < iksik2> hm
21:41 < tnorris> iksik2: and be warned, if you have tabs, they might look like utter crap. (from line 74 in vimrc)
21:42 < iksik2> i'm using space only indentation
21:42 < badem4o-work> tnorris: That is correct. The first time you run it it comes undefined and if you do replace a second time it works.
21:42 < badem4o-work> Not what I need 
21:42 < badem4o-work> Oh well 
21:43 < tnorris> iksik2: few fun changes: C-J, C-K shift page 3 lines up and down. and auto debug comments with ,dj
21:45 < iksik2> ehh, still copy&paste hell for me :D
21:45 < Azra-el> what is the normal result for ab -c1000 -n10000 for a hello world express app that was generated with express CLI and is running with nodemon app.js? 
21:45 < iksik2> but c-j/c-k looks nice :D
21:45 < tnorris> iksik2: are you using visual mode for C/P?
21:45 < Azra-el> because i get 73 req/sec and that just seems bad
21:46 < tnorris> Azra-el: depends on machine. on my i7 I can push 22k/sec
21:46 < iksik2> tnorris: yes, i'm trying :D
21:46 < Azra-el> tnorris ... well... 22k/s .. compared to 73/s
21:46 < tnorris> iksik2: it took me the longest to learn how to use buffers with C/P. until you can use those, it is hell.
21:47 < iksik2> tnorris: and i've noticed that your config in a beautiful way highlights matching brackets and words, how can i jump from one to another?
21:47 < tnorris> iksik2: use % when on the bracket.
21:47 < tnorris> you can use those when C/P to. really useful.
21:48 < iksik2> and for words?
21:48 < iksik2> variables for example
21:49 < tnorris> iksik2: hm?
21:50 < iksik2> tnorris: http://scr.hu/0u6x/po000  - 'fs' is highlighted here... is it possible to jump from one 'fs' to another?
21:50 < tnorris> iksik2: sure. start with *, then cycle through with n/N
21:51 < iksik2> tnorris: nice... thanks ;-)
21:54 < tnorris> iksik2: sort of complicated, but this helps me a lot: http://www.nathael.org/Data/vi-vim-cheat-sheet.svg
21:54 < tnorris> also may want to try http://vim-adventures.com/
21:56 < iksik2> tnorris: haha, thanks :D
21:57 < tnorris> iksik2: just remember, if you can think of it, vim can do it.
21:57 < tnorris> and macro's are the shiz.
21:58 < iksik2> yup, i know ;-)
22:00 < timkuijsten> Raynos: is it a fork from readable-stream?
22:02 < acidjazz> can i easily access session stuff in jade or do i nee to do something in the rendering
22:03 < wookiehangover> what's the name of the mongo-esque db that was just recently released? totally blanking on it, which doesn't help for searching for it
22:06 < tnorris> iksik2: oh, and I made a mistake. C/P in vim use _registers_. buffers are for the files (i'm sure you knew that, but had to correct my own stupidity)
22:06 < s5fs> vimcasts.org is also very useful
22:07 < iksik2> tnorris: hehe, okey... i'm trying to play the game, but... i can't go to far, heheh
22:07 < tnorris> s5fs: dude. I lost that url. thank you!
22:07 < iksik2> ok, my bad, got it now -_-
22:07 < iksik2> s5fs: thanks ;]
22:08 < Raynos> timkuijsten: its just a module that creates a new readable stream
22:08 < s5fs> thebrettman: np! i was sick a few weeks ago and watched every video, haha! super good stuff in there
22:08 < Raynos> Using https://github.com/Raynos/read-write-stream as a the readable/writable base class
22:09 < timkuijsten> Raynos: ic
22:09 < Raynos> way easier then figuring out how to use readable-stream/wrap
22:09 < timkuijsten> hmm..
22:09 < timkuijsten> Raynos: aah, and read-write is based on readable-stream from isaacs
22:10 < acidjazz> can i easily access session stuff in jade or do i nee to do something in the rendering
22:10 < Raynos> yes!
22:10 < Raynos> it just has a nicer api
22:11 < acidjazz> you answering me?
22:11 < Raynos> acidjazz: no. My tip is dont use sessions ever
22:11 < Raynos> sessions suck
22:12 < tnorris> iksik2: mother. I couldn't move around either, until I remember that vimium was capturing all my keys =P
22:13 < timkuijsten> Raynos: ok, let's give streams2 a try
22:13 < iksik2> tnorris: ;-DDDD
22:13 < iksik2> i'm stuck on these green fields :D
22:13 < Raynos> timkuijsten: https://github.com/Raynos/mongo-stream 
22:13 < Raynos> use at own risk!
22:13 < matbee> sessions suck?
22:13 < matbee> how?
22:14 < matbee> id kill someone if i had to constantly log in
22:14 < Raynos> timkuijsten: https://gist.github.com/4236930 that's what I use in production for mongo streams
22:14 < timkuijsten> cool!
22:15 < Raynos> its way easier to not use cursorstream at all.
22:15 < tnorris> iksik2: before or after the first maze?
22:15 < iksik2> haaaa got it :D
22:15 < iksik2> well it is first since hmmm 15 years now? :D
22:15 < Raynos> sessions suck because you can't cache static resources when they are stateful
22:15 < timkuijsten> Raynos: is it that bad? it has docs and looks pretty simple..
22:16 < timkuijsten> and used to work fine..
22:17 < tnorris> iksik2: you mean to use vim?
22:18 < Industrial> Say I have a `function a(x, y, z) {}`, x being a required parameter and y and z not. How do I call a without y? do I simply pass undefined? or null? or can I make it so I can call `a(1, 2)`, 2 being the argument for z?
22:18 < timkuijsten> Raynos: what about the memory usage of your mongo-stream when piping, it looks like it populates all results in memory before triggering your "oncursor"..
22:19 < timkuijsten> i mean, find first fetches every result in memory before triggering the callback right?
22:19 < iksik2> tnorris: ohh, didn't understand, sorry... before ;-P
22:19 < Raynos> timkuijsten: cursor.toArray fetches results
22:19 < Raynos> find doesnt fetch results
22:19 < Raynos> cursor.each starts streaming results
22:20 < timkuijsten> ok
22:20 < timkuijsten> ic
22:21 < b|lotus> Industrial: http://www.openjs.com/articles/optional_function_arguments.php it's simple
22:22 < Industrial> thanks
22:22 < Industrial> I love pages that list all the methods <3, not being picky and just handing it and saying you pick
22:22 < Industrial> also its way more insightful
22:25 < tnorris> iksik2: two more important things you can paste from clipboard using either "+p  or setting `pastetoggle` (shortcut <F3> in my vimrc).
22:25 < tnorris> otherwise the indentation will be fubar
22:28 < Zelest> What is the best way to generate a random unique string (a session variable) ?
22:31 < iksik2> tnorris: 'There's so much more...' maze solved ;-D
22:31 < iksik2> tnorris: okey, thanks again ;-)
22:32 < tnorris> Zelest: crypto.randomBytes(256).toString('hex')
22:32 < tnorris> iksik2: np. hit me up anytime you have a question
22:32 < iksik2> tnorris: okey, i will ;-)
22:33 < Zelest> tnorris, awesome, thanks!
22:34 < Zelest> tnorris, i assume crypto is "crypto = require('crypto')" ?
22:34 < tnorris> Zelest: yup
22:34 < Zelest> thanks
22:34 < tnorris> np
22:34 < acidjazz> is it possible to assign an object in jade to javascript that is being rendered client-side
22:36 < iksik2> tnorris: can I pm You?
22:36 < tnorris> yup
23:01 < samholmes> How could I network with peeps that are in the Node.js/web-dev scene?
23:02 <@konobi> samholmes: offer free beer
23:02 < samholmes> lol
23:03 < samholmes> Money = peoples respect..it's a sad world.
23:04 < samholmes> Money = Beer = peopes respect (in that order)
23:04 < samholmes> idk what peopes means, but w/e
23:04 < CoverSlide|Work> popes
23:04 < CoverSlide|Work> Pope Respekt!
23:05 < samholmes> OMFG, the pope should just go die!
23:05 < samholmes> ...but then, there'd just be another pope to replace him. x__x
23:05 < CoverSlide|Work> popes have been dying for thousands of years
23:13 < gladoscc> I need help getting Node.js's package rewriting working or whatever magic it does.
23:14 < gladoscc> [my ip]/socket.io/socket.io.js is not being served by node automatically.
23:14 < Industrial> Does this seem like a crazy idea? Am I DOINITRITE with the options objects or should I do it via class inheritance (e.g. class Parent extends Node) .. https://gist.github.com/9e0e18cb539c680ce42e
23:15 <@konobi> Industrial: tried the coffee script channel?
23:15 < Industrial> okey
23:22 < gladoscc> Could someone tell me how modules work?
23:22 < gladoscc> As in, where is socket.io.js
23:33 < amadeus_> hey, er, anyone
23:34 < amadeus_> had a question, i'm trying to create a new object 
23:34 < tnorris> gladoscc: have you read http://nodejs.org/api/modules.html already?
23:35 < gladoscc> tnorris: okay, I see, but that doesn't explain why node.js isn't passing the JS for socket.io/socket.io.js
23:35 < gladoscc> and instead letting the script handle it
23:36 <@konobi> gladoscc: socket.io itself serves the client JS
23:37 < tnorris> what he said
23:37 < gladoscc> oh ok
23:39 < gladoscc> Does node.js handle passing socket.io/ to socket.io?
23:40 < gladoscc> as in should my script be getting requests for it?
23:40 < tnorris> node.js parses the HTTP request and acts on what it receives.
23:41 < tnorris> if a file is asked for, then it can write out the file in the response.
23:41 <@konobi> gladoscc: nodejs only does what you tell it to... so depending on how you've initialized your socket-io...
23:43 < gladoscc> okay.. I haven't done anything differently other than accessing it with my public IP address instead of localhost.
23:43 < gladoscc> And after that, /socket.io/socket.io.js requests are given to my node.js webserver instead of returning the correct js file.
23:47 < styol> Ello. I just realized that for iterating over arrays that I could be using Array.forEach, but after some quick research, seems that on most browsers "for" outperforms "Array.forEach". The comparison didn't include Node, so it is perhaps not entirely applicable, but does anyone believe this is reason enough to continue to act like Array.forEach doesn't exist?
23:47 <@konobi> gladoscc: did you tell socket.io to listen somewhere?
23:48 <@konobi> gladoscc: ie: nopaste/pastebin time
23:48 < djazz> I'm making a chat app. Someone want to try it out? http://djazz.mine.nu:8080/
23:48 < gladoscc> konobi: yes, I told it to listen to a http server
23:49 <@konobi> gladoscc: show the code in gist/pastebin
23:49 < gladoscc> yep one sec please
23:51 < DaMorpheuS> question does passport allways returns a session cookie regardless if you are authenticated or not?!?
23:51 < DaMorpheuS> because in my it is
23:51 < DaMorpheuS> app
23:52 < rideh> Hey i have an idea, who wants to do it for me and we split the money?
23:52 < gladoscc> pastebin.com/FtD5DrJG
23:52 < rideh> just kidding… haha hi #node.js
23:53 < gladoscc> I have apache set up at port 8000. 
23:53 <@konobi> gladoscc: scoping problem
23:53 < rideh> just wanted to say i'm using node to build my first project and its quite an experience but i'm liking it quite a bit.
23:53 < gladoscc> konobi: scoping>?
23:54 <@konobi> gladoscc: try http://<ip>:9000/socket.io/socket.io.js
23:56 <@konobi> gladoscc: then have a look at the express 3 example on http://socket.io/#how-to-use
23:56 < misterhat> rideh: yes node is a very enjoyable experience 
23:56 < misterhat> sometimes while using it i get a bit to excited
23:56 < misterhat> too*
23:57 < gladoscc> konobi: port 9000 does work, but why would the code work fine when I'm connecting via my private IP or via localhost?
23:57 < gladoscc> Also I'm not using express 3
23:59 <@konobi> gladoscc: sure, but it shows you can have http and socket.io on the same port
