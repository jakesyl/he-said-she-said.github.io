00:00 < gladoscc> I'm using apache for port 8000 :)
00:02 < asadpakistani1> does couchdb go well with nodejs...or its mostly mongo thats being used in abundunce
00:03 <@konobi> gladoscc: sounds likean XY problem
00:04 < gladoscc> konobi: the problem is that I would like my_ip:80/n/socket.io/socket.io.js to work
00:04 <@konobi> then you're asking for http://localhost/n/socket.io/socket.io.js ?
00:05 < gladoscc> yp
00:05 < gladoscc> yep*
00:05 < gladoscc> that works
00:05 < gladoscc> 192.168.0.12/n/socket.io/socket.io.js works too
00:06 <@konobi> not sure how http-proxy works
00:08 < gladoscc> One thing I have noticed is that the pathname when accessing with the public IP starts with //
00:08 < gladoscc> Instead of just one /.
00:08 <@konobi> gladoscc: take http-proxy and apache out of the equation and then see how it works
00:08 < gladoscc> ok
00:12 < gladoscc> konobi: Directly accessing the node.js http server works, and socket.io works. pathname starts with /.
00:12 < gladoscc> right now I guess I'll just have to deal with having :9000
00:13 <@konobi> you could also use haproxy in front
00:13 < gladoscc> thanks, good idea
00:13 < Industrial> How do I set a property of a function (it's an object right?)
00:14 <@konobi> yes
00:14 < CoverSlide|Work> functionName.propertyName = value
00:14 < CoverSlide|Work> ++ haproxy
00:14 < Industrial> what if I have an object of properties that I want to copy into a function, can I do fn[key] = value ?
00:14 < CoverSlide|Work> sure
00:15 < CoverSlide|Work> it's an object remember
00:16 < gladoscc> OK, I have solved my problem lol
00:16 < gladoscc> The problem was I had public_ip/n to 127.0.0.1:9000
00:16 < gladoscc> it should be public_ip/n/ to 127.0.0.1:9000
00:16 < Industrial> konobi: yea well right now that ain't working :( (beware coffeescript output ..) https://gist.github.com/4bb19f8e41c0e3883f84 line 14..20
00:17 <@konobi> Industrial: looks like a CS screw up to me
00:17 <@konobi> Node != Node
00:18 <@konobi> anyways... i don't bother with CS... so can't help, sorry
00:19 < CoverSlide|Work> Industrial: so what's happening?
00:19 < CoverSlide|Work> do you get a reference error or something?
00:20 < Industrial> https://gist.github.com/4bb19f8e41c0e3883f84
00:20 < Industrial> divide isn't available because as the output shows (in the top), the this.service function stays empty though I fill it with this.service[key] = value
00:21 < othiym23> man, Oracle talks a good line of bullshit about Nashorn
00:22 < othiym23> there is some serious FUD in their slide stack (http://www.oracle.com/javaone/lad-en/session-presentations/clientside/24821-enok-1439095.pdf) about it
00:22 < othiym23> I'm sure Node.jar will be awesome, though
00:22 < CoverSlide|Work> node.jar?
00:23 < CoverSlide|Work> why?
00:23 < CoverSlide|Work> there's still vert.x
00:23 < othiym23> Google group discussion about embedding Node.js in the JVM
00:23 < othiym23> rwaldron suggested Nashorn as an alternative
00:24 < rwaldron> no... i did not.
00:24 <@konobi> if it's oracle, why bother
00:24 < othiym23> kind of wish he hadn't, as it's a. vaporware and b. kind of vague when it comes to what subset of Node it's going to implement
00:24 < othiym23> rwaldron: heh OK, just reread your message
00:24 < rwaldron> the word "purports" implies that I think their claims are false.
00:25 < othiym23> yeah
00:25 < rwaldron> as in, oracle is a poison and I think they are full of shit.
00:25 < othiym23> that slide deck is horseshit
00:25 < ako> java8 will be released at the end of 2013
00:25 < ako> nashorn really doesnt matter yet
00:25 < Industrial> CoverSlide|Work: any idea?
00:25 < rwaldron> and I'm concerned that developing a JS engine will actually entitle them to defend the JavaScript trademark
00:25 < Industrial> guess I should come up with a simplified JS example.
00:25 < Industrial> hold on xD
00:26 <@konobi> rwaldron: except it's already licenced
00:26 < rwaldron> the logic goes like... no product, can't really defend anything. have product, kill everyone.
00:26 < othiym23> rwaldron: can't everyone just say oh OK no problem we're just using browser-flavored ECMAScript now?
00:27 < othiym23> is TC-39 under any obligations to Oracle if they hold the trademark to the name?
00:27 <@konobi> oracle already hold the javascript trademark... it's licenced to netscape/mozilla
00:27 < rwaldron> othiym23 it would put Microsoft's WinJS project brand in jeopardy
00:27 < rwaldron> the reality is that they probably wouldnt get far
00:28 < othiym23> I would be interested to see what a talented team could build on top of the JVM with invokedynamic, as V8 and HotSpot share a lot of techniques (having also shared a lot of developers)
00:28 < rwaldron> othiym23 TC39 is part of ECMA, which is a standards body, so no, not at all
00:28 < othiym23> but yeah, Oracle is likely to leave a smoking crater
00:28 < othiym23> rwaldron: that's what I thought -- so is it mostly branding you're concerned about?
00:28 < rwaldron> konobi, I believe that's a myth
00:28 < Industrial> CoverSlide|Work: Guess there's something wrong with my code cause this works fine; https://gist.github.com/6f0a0d975d2b095a1bd4
00:29 < rwaldron> othiym23 I'm not worried about anything
00:29 <@konobi> rwaldron: proof?
00:29 < CoverSlide|Work> Yeah, haard for me to parse through it, gets a little convoluted
00:29 < rwaldron> it's just actual fact that they own the trademark and _could_ (in theory) attempt to defend it
00:29 <@konobi> rwaldron: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#Trademark
00:30 < othiym23> rwaldron: gotcha
00:30 < rwaldron> konobi, I didn't "I know for a fact"
00:30 < rwaldron> I said "I believe that's a myth"
00:30 <@konobi> well, mkay =0)
00:30 < rwaldron> my belief is based on a discussion with Brendan, in which he wasn't aware of any such license
00:30 <@konobi> "the more you know...."
00:31 < rwaldron> beyond a friendly agreement
00:31 < CoverSlide|Work> rwaldron: http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=75026640&caseType=SERIAL_NO&searchType=statusSearch << go down to "Current Owner(s) Information"
00:31 <@konobi> i think it's one of the things that got squared away during the sun takeover
00:32 < gladoscc> Is JS trademarked?
00:32 < gladoscc> as in, just JS.
00:32 < rwaldron> CoverSlide|Work: I'm not sure what you're showing me?
00:32 < CoverSlide|Work> rwaldron: patent and trademark office official records for the mark 
00:32 < CoverSlide|Work> "Javascript"
00:33 < rwaldron> CoverSlide|Work yes...
00:33 < rwaldron> and?
00:33 < rwaldron> Are you just confirming what I already said?
00:33 < CoverSlide|Work> which part did you believe was a myth? oracle ownership or the licensing?
00:33 < rwaldron> CoverSlide|Work: you misread
00:33 < rwaldron> I said, as fact, that oracle owns the trademark
00:33 < CoverSlide|Work> maybe you mispoke
00:34 < gladoscc> could anyone try connecting to 58.111.143.105?
00:34 < rwaldron> CoverSlide|Work nope, you misread
00:34 < CoverSlide|Work> gladoscc: down
00:34 < gladoscc> Kk
00:34 < gladoscc> Thanks
00:34 < rwaldron> I said that I believed Mozilla's "license" was a myth
00:34 < rwaldron> feel free to re-read
00:35 < CoverSlide|Work> ok
00:35 < gladoscc> okay, my ISP blocks port 80 I guess.
00:36 < onr> yeah y'all have to pay Oracle for every single line of JavaScript you write.
00:36 < CoverSlide|Work> it's only on the trademark, not the language itself
00:36 < CoverSlide|Work> they don't own the language
00:36 < rwaldron> (that would be a real nightmare)
00:37 < CoverSlide|Work> in fact, i think based on the recent oracle v google thing, it would be near impossible for them to do so even if they did
00:37 < CoverSlide|Work> but ianal
00:39 < CoverSlide|Work> but linked lists recently got patented, so everyone using lisp or haskell gets to pay up
00:40 < CoverSlide|Work> er maybe not recently
00:40 < onr> i think the worst scenario would be between oracle and companies use "javascript" brand somewhere
00:40 < rwaldron> I feel like it was recently circulating
00:41 < gladoscc> does 58.111.143.105:8123 work?
00:41 <@konobi> CoverSlide|Work: LSI
00:41 < gladoscc> works on 3G but downforeveryoneorjustme says it's down.
00:42 <@konobi> mafiahunt
00:42 < gladoscc> Thanks
00:45 < CoverSlide|Work> yeah it was on hacker news in oct
00:55 < tnorris> cluster freakin' rocks!
00:55 < tnorris> I need to use it way more often
00:57 <@isaacs> tnorris: glad you like it.  give your praises to AndreasMadsen
00:58 < tnorris> AndreasMadsen you are the shiz!
00:58 <@Nexxy> so, SF is crazy
01:00 < tnorris> isaacs: i know the docs say experimental, but I want to use that everywhere.
01:00 <@isaacs> tnorris: go for it
01:00 <@isaacs> tnorris: it'll probably be upgraded to unstable soon
01:00 < Raynos> Anyone have any recommended benchmarking tools ?
01:00 < tnorris> awesomeness.
01:02 < tnorris> Raynos: what type of benchmarking
01:02 < Raynos> I have a memory leak somewhere
01:02 < Raynos> so i want to benchmark all my HTTP routes and check memory usage after each run
01:02 < tnorris> so, profile.
01:02 < tnorris> Raynos: try this: https://github.com/bnoordhuis/node-heapdump
01:03 < Raynos> I've tried
01:03 < Raynos> I've also core dumped
01:03 < Raynos> and inspected in mdb
01:03 < iain_> dtrace
01:03 < Raynos> I can't analyse it
01:03 < Raynos> I tried dtrace and flame graphs too
01:03 < iain_> oh
01:04 < tnorris> Raynos: is it a complex app?
01:04 < Raynos> its just a http api server
01:05 < tnorris> Raynos: well when all else fails I usually start from the minimum and slowly add on while benchmarking. slow an painful, but has yet to fail me.
01:05 <@konobi> Raynos: webkit-dev-agent
01:05 < Raynos> tnorris: that's what I'm thinking hit every end point a 1000 times and see which one makes the biggest spike in RSS
01:06 <@konobi> with the dev agent you can at least see and delve into heap usage

02:07 <@konobi> isaacs: ping?
02:08 < othiym23> what's the fastest way to wrap an array that's a property on an object such that I can observe updates to that array?
02:09 < othiym23> i.e. I want to hijack / observe item.array[pos] but it's from someone else's code
02:09 <@konobi> in v8 space?
02:09 < othiym23> in JS if possible
02:10 <@konobi> othiym23: i suppose you could attempt to overload Array
02:10 < othiym23> it seems like I should be able to abuse accessors to get what I want
02:10 <@konobi> though with modules, not sure that'll happen
02:11 < acidjazz> how the hell do i lookup a record in mongoose by _id?
02:11 < othiym23> somethin' bad is happening to some EventEmitters and I'm trying to figure out if it's in request or http or EventEmitter or what
02:11 < othiym23> here's a gist: https://gist.github.com/0d418c1d78a4e28445fe
02:16 < samholmes> Why can't node-mysql prefix columns with table names?
02:17 < othiym23> samholmes: cuz that's not generally how SQL works?
02:18 < othiym23> node-mysql doesn't do a lot of transformation of what it gets back from MySQL
02:18 < samholmes> How then, could I get a result set with prefixes so that way I can transform the data?
02:19 < othiym23> what's the problem you're trying to solve?
02:23 < samholmes> othiym23:http://pastie.org/5496874
02:24 <@konobi> samholmes: <blah>
02:25 < samholmes> konobi: ?
02:25 <@konobi> exactly
02:26 < pppaul> so
02:27 <@konobi> samholmes: all i saw was an irc log... so i skipped it
02:27 < othiym23> samholmes: so there's a lot of text there, but it sounds like you probably want to put some work into refining your query rather than trying to do it on the other end
02:27 < othiym23> i.e. with an inner join to weed out the rows that don't match the FK
02:28 < samholmes> othiym23: read from the end backwards. :P
02:29 < samholmes> But your right...
02:29 <@konobi> i have a great mysql dba contact
02:29 < samholmes> ...I want to do a JOIN then refactor my result set to be a multi-dimensional array.
02:29 < samholmes> konobi: I'm interested? :)
02:30 <@konobi> samholmes: depends on a lot... i'm picky about who i refer
02:30 < samholmes> konobi: That's a good thing. What are the dependencies?
02:31 < othiym23> konobi: I passed her along to my ops team up in PDX, but they weren't interested in a fulltime DBA I guess
02:31 < othiym23> samholmes: you definitely do not want to be trying to perform a join in JS, which is what your problem statement makes it sound like you're trying to do
02:31 <@konobi> samholmes: p/m me
02:32 < othiym23> for one thing, the DB will have to return a huge pile of data and then the driver will have to deserialize the data before you can work with it
02:32 <@konobi> othiym23: newrelic, right?
02:32 < othiym23> for another, you're cutting the query planner out of the loop, which is going to make for slower query execution than you would get if you did it all in the DB
02:32 < othiym23> konobi: y
02:32 <@konobi> kk
02:36 < deoxxa> so i find myself putting asynchronous calls in process.nextTick (see https://github.com/deoxxa/pa-archive/blob/master/index.js#L52 for what i mean) - i'm pretty sure it's the right thing to do, but i'm not aware of any situations where it actually causes problems to not do that
02:37 < deoxxa> can someone explain to me how an application could break if i called a callback on the same tick?
02:37 < deoxxa> (aside from the obvious stack explosion)
02:37 < deoxxa> (if there's anything aside from that)
02:38 < JohnnyL> http://linux.slashdot.org/story/12/12/07/1527225/rms-speaks-out-against-ubuntu
02:38 <@konobi> rms-speaks-out-about-breathing-claims-takes-oxygen-from-parrots
02:39 < othiym23> deoxxa: it's generally so that EventEmitters have a chance to set themselves up before events start coming in, so you don't lose any
02:39 < othiym23> it's a pretty strong convention for that reason
02:45 < asadpakistani1> I am very confused whether to go with mongo or couch...theres so much fan boy "you suck" articles on the net with no real content. I want to have an offline database that then syncs with an online database when available. Both accepts writes that are to be synced. Which is a better solution for me?
02:46 <@konobi> asadpakistani1: seen pouch?
02:46 < othiym23> asadpakistani1: because sync is built into the design, you may find CouchDB to be a better fit than MongoDB, which does have good replication / sharding, but which isn't really designed to handle the situation you describe out of the box
02:46 <@konobi> pouchdb that is
02:47 < asadpakistani1> knobi: i will see couch.
02:47 <@konobi> o.O
02:48 < asadpakistani1> pouch*
02:48 < daleharvey> asadpakistani1: what do you mean by 'offline'?
02:48 < asadpakistani1> daleharvey: running on a local network
02:48 < asadpakistani1> daleharvey: running on a warehouse lcoation to be specific.
02:48 < asadpakistani1> daleharvey: internet might be available but not all the time
02:48 < daleharvey> asadpakistani1: thats very much the pouchdb / couchdb use case
02:50 < daleharvey> pouchdb is going to integrate is a bit nicer if your app is node, its an npm away, but pouchdb is also very early days, especially for node, and you will almost certainly run into bugs, couchdb will be solid, just a bit more of a hassle to package
02:50 < asadpakistani1> what i don't understand is. Lets say i increment a value in a document on one database. Then some internet user increments the value on another database. Now what I don't understand is will the document that was incremented the latest win...or will i get the sum of the increments. I obviously want the sum of the increments because both increments are individual modifications to the document.
02:50 < deoxxa> othiym23: that makes sense
02:50 < asadpakistani1> daleharvey: some fanboys are saying the http overhead makes it too slow...any truth to that?
02:50 < daleharvey> asadpakistani1: you will get 2 documents each with the number incremented, you can then choose to sum them if you want
02:51 < asadpakistani1> daleharvey: will this be done in my app...or I will have to define how to handle syncing for each collection
02:51 <@konobi> asadpakistani1: pre-optimization
02:52 < asadpakistani1> konobi: were you referening to the increment problem?
02:52 <@konobi> might be a worry if you're on a 28k modem
02:52 < daleharvey> as konobi said, measure it, when you are talking over a local network you are going to get pretty good throughput over http
02:52 <@konobi> asadpakistani1: http "overhead"
02:52 < asadpakistani1> daleharvey: http overhead shouldnt be an issue...the issue is synching individual increments
02:53 < daleharvey> asadpakistani1: also, if you use the pouchdb as a way to communicate with couchdb, you can just swap them around for each other
02:53 < asadpakistani1> daleharvey: who decides how to handle the syncing for various keys...cuz lets say theres a name key...the latest update can win..no issues...but if its an addition to the old value then something else needs to be done
02:54 <@konobi> asadpakistani1: then you need multiple endpoints
02:54 < asadpakistani1> daleharvey: pouch looks new...this application needs to use a little bit more stable software
02:54 <@konobi> (CAP theorem)
02:55 < asadpakistani1> konobi: I wil have a different endpoints for each database
02:55 < daleharvey> asadpakistani1: couch + pouch's model is each document has an id, everything is keyed on that id, if you write to the same document (one with the same id) in various places then when they sync that document will be in conflict, you can ask for all the writes that were in conflict and resolve them in the app
02:55 < asadpakistani1> konobi: two in my case
02:55 <@konobi> asadpakistani1: look at CAP
02:55 < daleharvey> asadpakistani1: yes pouch is definitely too new to be considered stable, you want to look at couch
02:55 < asadpakistani1> konobi: i have looked at cap...couch is more on the AP end
02:55 < asadpakistani1> i much appreciate the help
02:55 <@konobi> asadpakistani1: so decide which two are important
02:56 < asadpakistani1> so custom syncing can happen
02:56 < asadpakistani1> AP is important
02:56 < asadpakistani1> and essentially what i want
02:56 < asadpakistani1> but I want a controlled eventual consistency
02:56 < asadpakistani1> not just copying the latest version
02:56 < asadpakistani1> I wanna resolve the conflict in a custom way...If the update modifies the value by applying logic to it...instead of just writing it
02:56 <@konobi> asadpakistani1: riak might be an option
02:56 < daleharvey> asadpakistani1: http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/conflicts.html may explain it better
02:57 < daleharvey> asadpakistani1: I just said quite a few times, your application decides how to resolve the conflict
02:57 < asadpakistani1> daleharvey: much appreciate tht guys...
02:57 < asadpakistani1> I think i should finish this o'rielly book
02:57 < asadpakistani1> before further confusing myself
02:58 < asadpakistani1> daleharey: So i will have to wait for the user to make a request for teh conflict to be resolved...I cant do it in the background?
02:58 < asadpakistani1> this nosql stuff is a mind fudge..but certainly powerfull
02:58 < daleharvey> asadpakistani1: your application can listen for conflicting writes and resolve them in the background
02:58 < asadpakistani1> daleharvey: ahan
02:59 < asadpakistani1> daleharvey: nice...thanks
02:59 < daleharvey> http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/notifications.html
02:59 < zomg> Oh, google apparently no longer offers the free tier of Google Apps... what do I use for my domain's email now :\
02:59 < asadpakistani1> daleharvey: cool
02:59 < zomg> Thankfully it seems the existing ones will be kept going
02:59 < asadpakistani1> zomg: wht...even google maps!?
03:00 < zomg> asadpakistani1: no I mean the stuff like having gmail handle your domain's email
03:00 < asadpakistani1> zomg: it depeneds from app to app...https://code.google.com/apis/console/
03:00 < zomg> eg. http://apps.google.com stuff
03:01 < asadpakistani1> zomg: yeah u gotta pay em for gmail with domain...sucks
03:01 < zomg> It was quite convenient when you could easily set up new domains with gmail for mail
03:01 < asadpakistani1> zomg: use qmail-postfix
03:01 < zomg> Yeah well it's not that easy :)
03:02 < zomg> You have to keep in mind things like spam filtering etc., generally any email sent from google servers will have good status
03:02 < asadpakistani1> zomg: well they wun charge tht much...certainly not as much as a mail server
03:02 < asadpakistani1> zomg: true tht
03:02 < zomg> but if you can't use google anymore, you need to send the mail through your own server.. which could be on amazon ec2, which in turn is used for spam so it's harder to get it not to go into the spambox by default
03:03 < asadpakistani1> zomg: well ur server if not open relay wun go in spam...i thot you were talking about incomming spam...which is  a problem
03:03 < asadpakistani1> zomg: opensource spam filters are not tht great
03:03 < zomg> Well if you ever try to send email from a server hosted on Amazon EC2, be prepared for your email to never arrive in the destionation inbox =)
03:06 < asadpakistani1> one more question guys...mongo db supprots 64bit ints...couch doesnt
03:06 < asadpakistani1> does doing all ur computation in floats...takes a big toll on performance
03:07 < daleharvey> 'measure'
03:07 <@konobi> stats, stats, stats
03:15 < asadpakistani1> what is this nonsense man...ppl need a life...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URJeuxI7kHo
03:17 < daleharvey> asadpakistani1: the 'nosql' is particularly prone to fanboys and flamewars, its a shame, but there are lots of awesome people too, just need to actively ignore a lot
03:17 <@konobi> well, why not use both... sorted
03:17 < deoxxa> ha
03:17 < deoxxa> that video is classic
03:22 < garbagecollectio> can someone explain to me why i didnt get any startup job as a programmer
03:22 < garbagecollectio> from a fortune 50 company
03:22 < asadpakistani1> deoxxa: some college professor is pissed
03:22 < garbagecollectio> when i a better than the people there
03:22 <@konobi> garbagecollectio: humility
03:22 < asadpakistani1> daleharvey: btw...i am loving couch db...its really easy to work with
03:22 < garbagecollectio> i mean assume i am humble
03:23 <@konobi> o.O
03:23 < deoxxa> garbagecollectio: maybe you need to be more aggressive in your interviews
03:23 < garbagecollectio> that is what i think
03:23 < deoxxa> garbagecollectio: have you tried punching the interviewer in the face
03:23 < garbagecollectio> so u think in hte face to face i have to really lay out that i cna do the job an
03:23 < deoxxa> "FUCK YOU, GIEF JERB NOW"
03:23 < deoxxa> yeah
03:23 < garbagecollectio> and how
03:23 < garbagecollectio> like sell myself hard
03:23 < deoxxa> yeah definitely
03:23 < garbagecollectio> see im not doing that i just kinda assume that they see my ode and stuff
03:23 < deoxxa> keep talking about yourself
03:23 < garbagecollectio> code
03:23 < garbagecollectio> i mean they invited me in based on my code
03:23 < daleharvey> asadpakistani1: yeh there are parts of couch that are awesome
03:23 < deoxxa> tell them about your deepest fears and regrets
03:24 < garbagecollectio> deoxxa, now u are trying to sabatoge me
03:24 < deoxxa> what? why would i do that?
03:24 < deoxxa> that's stupid
03:24 <@konobi> tell them about the best type of porn to code to
03:24 < deoxxa> you're stupid
03:24 < othiym23> so does anybody know offhand where in the Node source JSON.stringify is defined?
03:24 < deoxxa> othiym23: it's in V8
03:24 < othiym23> I am on the trail of a profoundly stupid bug
03:24 < othiym23> deoxxa: thanks, that's what I thought
03:24 < deoxxa> othiym23: but... aside form that... i'm not sure
03:24 < deoxxa> *from
03:25 < deoxxa> garbagecollectio: demonstrate an intimate knowledge of the hit television series "my little pony"
03:25 < deoxxa> garbagecollectio: and draw a double rainbow on the whiteboard in the interview room
03:25 < garbagecollectio> othiym23: lol 
03:25 < deoxxa> garbagecollectio: then explain (condescendingly) how loops work
03:25 < SomeoneWeird> lol'd
03:25 < deoxxa> that's a sure-fire way to get hired
03:25 <@konobi> the best interview i ever had was where i cam out feeling totally dumb... i only found out years later that they kept popping out to get more stuff to ask me, as they hadn't had a clueful interviewee in years
03:25 < garbagecollectio> deoxxa: give me real advice
03:26 < garbagecollectio> konobi, u get job?
03:26 < othiym23> deoxxa: fwiw, it's in https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/v0.8/deps/v8/src/json.js
03:26 <@konobi> garbagecollectio: yes
03:26 < deoxxa> othiym23: oh neat
03:26 < garbagecollectio> so are dev interviews basically they try to stump u with questions and u need to fire back and not be stumped and act like u are sure about everything
03:26 < othiym23> now, the next question is, what in that huge wad of code could be causing an EventEmitter to emit when it's called on the emitter?
03:26 < garbagecollectio> no hesitation
03:26 <@konobi> they interview well... what is the persons limits of knowledge and are they willing to be okay with that
03:27 <@konobi> (or know where to look up that info)
03:27 <@konobi> no... just admit you don't know
03:27 < deoxxa> garbagecollectio: in all honesty, if they called you in based on code, then you didn't get the job, it sounds like you've got some other deficiency
03:27 < deoxxa> garbagecollectio: and i know you're not going to want to hear it, but it's probably your personality, or how you present yourself
03:28 < garbagecollectio> right but we were laughing  and drinking beers at the end of the itnerview
03:28 < garbagecollectio> doing fist bumps
03:28 < garbagecollectio> showing code samples
03:28 < garbagecollectio> i have one year of experience, they say im not "senior" enough
03:28 < garbagecollectio> after inviting me in though
03:28 < deoxxa> well... yeah
03:28 < garbagecollectio> and after seeing my code
03:28 < deoxxa> one year isn't exactly senior
03:28 <@konobi> "pppssttt... i think drinks might be the easiest way to get rid of this sucker... i think he might stab me in the face otherwise"
03:28 < garbagecollectio> but what if my knowledge is basically senior
03:29 < deoxxa> doesn't matter if your attitude is still at "YEAH FIST BUMPS AND BEER"
03:29 <@konobi> one year... not senior at all
03:29 <@konobi> and that's not based on knowledge
03:29 < deoxxa> garbagecollectio: you may have gotten further had you declined the offer to "get smashed broooo"
03:29 < garbagecollectio> they have beer
03:29 < garbagecollectio> in their fridge
03:30 < garbagecollectio> they offered it
03:30  * deoxxa shrugs
03:30  * konobi roflcopters for a while
03:30 < deoxxa> they saw something they didn't like
03:30 < deoxxa> try figure out what that is
03:30 < garbagecollectio> i did they said not senior enough
03:31 < deoxxa> that's what we call a "cop out" excuse
03:31 < deoxxa> i.e. it wasn't true
03:31 < garbagecollectio> right
03:31 < garbagecollectio> thats what i think too
03:31 < garbagecollectio> so u think its more they just didnt like me
03:31 < garbagecollectio> see i dont believe that though
03:31 < garbagecollectio> we had a great time
03:32 < deoxxa> that's not necessarily what they were looking for
03:32 < SomeoneWeird> maybe it's your code
03:32 < deoxxa> they might have wanted someone more grounded
03:32 < deoxxa> sounds like they already have enough "rockstar" programmers
03:32 < garbagecollectio> no
03:32 < garbagecollectio> the interivew was a discussion
03:32 < garbagecollectio> thats all it was
03:32 < garbagecollectio> after sending code in
03:32 < garbagecollectio> and answering some questions about it
03:32 < deoxxa> ok
03:33 < deoxxa> well the bottom line is that they didn't like something about you
03:33 < deoxxa> you have to figure out what that is and fix it
03:33 < garbagecollectio> i think they just thought i was senior enough
03:33 < deoxxa> or find somewhere where it's not a problem
03:33 < garbagecollectio> but why have me come in if not senior enough
03:33 <@konobi> can be hard to guage
03:33 < deoxxa> "senior" isn't just experience or time on the job
03:33 < deoxxa> attitude plays a -huge- role there
03:34 < nicholasf> garbagecollectio: or dont fix it, maybe it just wasnt the right place for you
03:34 <@konobi> my expectations of a senior is someone others can learn from without being taking through a wringer
03:35 <@konobi> and still get shit done
03:35 < nicholasf> a job advert I've looked at described a senior dev as someone with a 1000 yard stare, which is simplistic but touches upon it
03:36 < garbagecollectio> i didnt act confident about scaling mongo
03:36 <@konobi> "what is your greatest failure and what have you learned from it"
03:36 < garbagecollectio> cause i have no idea how to scale mongo
03:36 < garbagecollectio> and thats not even what they asked
03:36 <@konobi> mine was getting into a company with a bad CEO and not getting out quickly enough
03:37 < garbagecollectio> i dont know what their deal was
03:37 < garbagecollectio> i am in a bad company now
03:37 < deoxxa> konobi: i once zipped my pants up too quick - best believe i'm not doing that shit ever again
03:37 < garbagecollectio> someone just called me a php loser
03:37 < garbagecollectio> a java guy
03:37 <@konobi> deoxxa: oh... too true, too true
03:38 < deoxxa> one thing i like about living by the bay is that my clothes dry quickly
03:38 < deoxxa> so convenient
03:38 <@konobi> i will say, a lot of the time, interviewers can be terrible (though you can work around that)
03:38 < garbagecollectio> deoxxa hgow much dp u make
03:38 < garbagecollectio> i mean ive been looking to leave my job now for a month and cant get offer
03:38 <@konobi> but underlying attitude is something you can't shake off
03:38 < deoxxa> garbagecollectio: salary?
03:38 < garbagecollectio> its absurd
03:38 < garbagecollectio> yeah
03:38 < deoxxa> garbagecollectio: base is like 110k
03:39 < garbagecollectio> shit
03:39 < deoxxa> + overtime
03:39 < garbagecollectio> years experience and speciality?
03:39 < deoxxa> hmm, i've been programming for like 5 years
03:39 < deoxxa> i don't think i have a speciality
03:40 <@konobi> man, i must be old
03:40 < deoxxa> is "learning" a speciality?
03:40 < deoxxa> if so, that
03:40 < nicholasf> juniors always count their years possessively, sometimes in a contrived way, to get past being junior
03:40 < nicholasf> it's just about solving problems and knowing how to work in a team 
03:40 < deoxxa> mmm
03:40 < nicholasf> doesnt really matter how many years of experience you have
03:40 < othiym23> mikeal you crazy magnificent bastard, your toJSON method in request has some sort of super weird bug in it
03:40 < nicholasf> if that comes across, they'll hire you
03:41 < garbagecollectio> i agree
03:41 < deoxxa> it helps to be friendly, but not "BROOOOOOO" friendly
03:41 < garbagecollectio> i think i act sheepish
03:41 < garbagecollectio> they initiated the broness
03:41 < garbagecollectio> not me
03:41 < nicholasf> deoxxa: knowing how to work with others is such a huge thing
03:41 < nicholasf> different teams have different dynamics
03:41 < deoxxa> nicholasf: very true
03:42 <@konobi> also depends on the personality type at the head of the team a lot
03:42 < deoxxa> nicholasf: that's something i have very little experience with - i've nearly always been a team of exactly one
03:42 < nicholasf> deoxxa: yeh, it can be dangerous to be too solo sometimes
03:42 < deoxxa> when i have worked with other people though, it's generally gone well
03:42 <@konobi> and having OSS connections in that space helps a lot
03:42 < deoxxa> unless there's just a genuine personality clash
03:42 < nicholasf> but that's ok so long as you have it in the back of your mind that while you're getting great problem solving skills you know you have to go and earn some cred working in teams
03:43 < deoxxa> like, i don't think my interpersonal skills for working in teams are any worse than my interpersonal skills for dealing with people in general
03:43 <@konobi> apparently i just don't have enough nodejs street cred these days... *sniffle*
03:43 < deoxxa> konobi: there there, try writing 999999999 npm packages
03:43 <@konobi> =0P
03:43 < s5fs> konobi: sorry, we need at least 5 years experience with node.js and express 3 to be considered for this position
03:44 < deoxxa> ha
03:44 <@konobi> s5fs: got that!
03:44 <@konobi> =0P
03:44 < deoxxa> it's scary how many recruiters ask for that kind of thing
03:44 < deoxxa> what was the email that dhh got about rails?
03:44 < deoxxa> they were like "how many years experience do you have with rails"
03:44 < deoxxa> he replied "ALL OF THEM"
03:44 < s5fs> konobi: "great great.."  *shuffles papers*
03:44 < garbagecollectio> Maybe this is paranoia, but I'm beginning to find a lot of threads like this (and a few yesterday about 'how to hire people') actively coercive: "Contribute to Open Source or Don't Get Hired".
03:45 <@konobi> i was at joyent before ryan started... so i know node fairly well... but yeah, weird to talk to recruiters
03:45 < nicholasf> my biggest problem is working with inept programmers
03:45 < nicholasf> I'm still not sure if it's my problem 
03:45 < s5fs> nicholasf: its half your problem
03:45 < nicholasf> I've run into that a few times when freelancing
03:45 < nicholasf> s5fs: what's the other half? :)
03:45 < s5fs> them
03:45 < nicholasf> hrm, Im uncertain
03:45 < s5fs> haha!
03:45 <@konobi> well, with freelancing you need a bit of buffer space
03:45 < nicholasf> I think it's better to be intolerant of really bad programmers
03:46 <@konobi> since it could be incompetence of just bad comms
03:46 < nicholasf> even if it means you discover you shouldnt be working in some projects where the money is good etc
03:46 < deoxxa> nicholasf: i think it's easier to work with someone who's unskilled but willing to learn, than someone who's highly skilled but unwilling to adapt
03:46 < nicholasf> konobi: nah, there are truly incompetent programmers out there
03:46 < deoxxa> nicholasf: though generally unskilled programmers who like learning don't stay unskilled for long
03:46 < s5fs> i've been consulting for 3+ years now and did about 2yrs freelance before that. at the end of the day, i'm as much to blame as my bad customers, and if i cannot be successful while surrounded with shitty devs, thats half my fault.
03:46 <@konobi> nicholasf: trust me, i've been there
03:46 < zomg> oh horror stories about freelancing
03:46 < nicholasf> also juniors that think they're senior and the management doesnt know how to control them
03:46 < zomg> I became funemployed today and will probably be freelancing next...
03:46 < zomg> :P
03:46 <@konobi> i think i'm at +23 freelancers sacked
03:46 < s5fs> nicholasf: bad management, that's something i can't hang with, haha! i try to drop those engagements.
03:47 <@konobi> zomg: yay!
03:47 < nicholasf> if anyone here is Melbourne, Australia we're looking to hire Noders in the new year
03:47 < s5fs> konobi: just fyi, i'm always looking for a new challenge to come up short at.
03:47 < nicholasf> going to advertise a bit later
03:47 < deoxxa> nicholasf: i used to work with a guy who had a heavy background in maths (phd etc) and he just refused to budge on some things that really didn't make sense for what we were doing. it was hard :<
03:47 < garbagecollectio> i think a caste checker website would be a popular ebsite
03:47 <@konobi> s5fs: lol
03:47 < garbagecollectio> see what is a "bad" programmer
03:47 < zomg> nicholasf: if you're ok with remoting I might be up for it
03:47 < garbagecollectio> zomg: what happened?
03:47 < nicholasf> deoxxa: yeh, this is why I think the fundamental skill a programmer needs to have is the ability to read other people and know how to program cooperatively
03:47 < zomg> garbagecollectio: startup ran out of money, couldn't afford to keep me
03:48 < deoxxa> garbagecollectio: someone who doesn't want to learn
03:48 < nicholasf> zomg: we're consider remoting in our timezone
03:48 < nicholasf> anyway I'll come into channel and shout about it a bit closer to the date
03:48 < s5fs> nicholasf: fully agree. that includes 'dumbing down' your code to not severely exceed coworkers abilities (imho)
03:48 < garbagecollectio> deoxxa: u attribute good coding to 
03:48 < zomg> nicholasf: GMT +2 in my case so a bit off yours
03:48 < nicholasf> s5fs: yup
03:48 < garbagecollectio> i cant get a job
03:48 <@konobi> nicholasf: it's .au though... =0/
03:48 < garbagecollectio> i have a top job where they treat me like shit
03:48 < nicholasf> yeh, we're .nz friendly, for example
03:48 < nicholasf> anyway, have to get back to codig
03:48 < s5fs> nicholasf: that is probably the most challenging part of my job, continually being held back by my peers, haha! it's like school all over again
03:48 < nicholasf> codig is what I do with zero sleep
03:49 < s5fs> codig wif a cold
03:49 < nicholasf> s5fs: open source is good for that, you can find new teams
03:49 < nicholasf> yeh I have a cold *and* zero sleep 
03:49 <@konobi> i may have need for some freelance folk in the not too distant future... we'll see
03:49 < s5fs> nicholasf: take two liters of mt dew and call us in the morning
03:49 < nicholasf> ha
03:50 < garbagecollectio> how canu actually do this in jquery
03:50 < garbagecollectio> $(params).whattodo
03:50 < garbagecollectio> how does that work
03:50 < garbagecollectio> is $ an object that takes parameters?
03:50 < zomg> $ is a function
03:50 < garbagecollectio> its unusual syntax
03:51 < garbagecollectio> right but if its a function how do you have t he .
03:51 < zomg> it returns an object
03:51 < garbagecollectio> ahhhh
03:51 < garbagecollectio> i could have written jqury
03:51 < garbagecollectio> isnt that enough to get hired?
03:52 <@konobi> that's a bold statement that wouldn't get you hired
03:52 < _numbers> wanted to share my stand-alone pure-js (no-selenium) cross-browser compatible integration test suite that can record your activity and play it back as an automated test: http://youtu.be/QGy2ItNo7rI
03:53 < s5fs> garbagecollectio: hard to say, why not write a competing jquery and see if you get hired
03:54 < zomg> I wrote a bf3 server admin tool in node which is probably harder to write than jquery...
03:54 < zomg> and no one has still hired me!
03:54 < zomg> what's going on!
03:55 < zomg> People should be lining up at my door handing me job offers
03:55 < zomg> =)
03:55 < boltR> give me ur address
03:55 < nso95> sounds legit
03:56 < zomg> lol
03:57 <@konobi> boltR: yeah... either you need to make sense or we need to keep an eye on you
03:58 <@konobi> _numbers: you see what saucelabs just released?
03:58 < _numbers> konobi: i have a paid sauce account. but what specifically?
03:58 <@konobi> the new mac app
03:59 < _numbers> oh they made it feel more native on mac os
03:59 <@konobi> yeah, seksy though
03:59 < boltR> konobi: ?
03:59 < _numbers> ya i use sauce still for things. i really like their iOS and Android environments
04:00 <@konobi> boltR: want a SSN to go with that?
04:00 < boltR> bank routing/account number is more preferable
04:01 < boltR> especially one with money
04:01  * konobi gets the big ass boot at the ready
04:01 <@konobi> boltR: hopefully you see what i mean ^_^
04:01 < boltR> konobi: looks like you have a bit of trouble in understanding humor
04:02 <@konobi> boltR: nope... just from a compsec background =0)
04:03 <@konobi> (and knowing that 95% of "hacks" are actually exercises in social engineering)
04:05 <@konobi> *tumbleweed*
04:09 < XBOCT> Hi, can someone please explain to me how I would go about using mongojs to generate an object I want to send to the user, but the object is an 'amalgamation' (join) of multiple collections?
04:10 < XBOCT> as in let's say I have an event doc in my events collection, and various member docs in my members collection
04:10 < gladoscc> XBOCT: Off topic, but I think I saw your name before.
04:10 < gladoscc> You play dota 2?
04:11 < XBOCT> i do but
04:11 < XBOCT> im not the XBOCT you're thinking of
04:11 < XBOCT> not the world famous one
04:11 < XBOCT> anyway; to elaborate on my question: i want to generate something like { "eventname": "blah", "members" : [{"name":"John"}, {"name":"Alice"}] }
04:12 < XBOCT> so the eventname comes from the events collection but the members are from the members collection - i need a way to put them together and send that across
04:12 < gladoscc> How is event name linked with members?
04:12 < XBOCT> in the event doc there's a list of _id's that refer to the members
04:13 < XBOCT> so the actual event doc is like {"name":"blah", "members":["a1351351","1rweg4t2"] }
04:13 < XBOCT> sorta like that
04:13 < FunnyLookinHat> is anyone here running Ubuntu Raring ( the alpha ) ?  I'm wondering if the quantal packages for nodejs in the PPA would work well enough to migrate for now.
04:13 < gladoscc> XBOCT: AFAIK, MongoDB does not support joins in the SQL sense
04:14 < XBOCT> yeah exactly i understand
04:14 < gladoscc> So, try just querying the name.
04:14 < XBOCT> so in my nodejs app i'm doing a search for the event
04:14 < XBOCT> then afterwards i want to search for each member
04:14 < XBOCT> and append it to a 'var result'
04:14 < gladoscc> When you get ID query each member to turn "a1351351" into "John"
04:14 < XBOCT> yup, already doing that
04:14 < ChessTeach> Can someone recommend a library for parsing BBCode?
04:14 < XBOCT> problem is the query to find john
04:14 < XBOCT> is asyncronous
04:14 < gladoscc> ChessTeach: inb4 regex
04:15 < XBOCT> and there's no way to do it sync as far as i know
04:15 < gladoscc> ChessTeach: https://github.com/ncb000gt/node-bbcode
04:15 < gladoscc> XBOCT: What about just adding the name to the event doc?
04:15 < XBOCT> see i was thinking about that option too but
04:15 < XBOCT> the member can be associated with more than just events
04:16 < gladoscc> I'm not too good with MongoDB, so I can't really help you more. Sorry.
04:16 < XBOCT> sadface.jpg :(
04:16 < gladoscc> Try #mongodb or Stack Overflow.
04:16 < ChessTeach> gladoscc: I looked at that library already... I am still a little new to NodeJs. How can I get the code to just return the converstion? The example code wants me to pass the string and a function...
04:17 < gladoscc> ChessTeach: in node,js, function callbacks are like carbon dioxide.
04:17 < ChessTeach> gladoscc: I don't understand this obsession with temporary functions
04:17 < gladoscc> bbcode.parse('[b]text[/b]', function(content) { console.log(content) } 
04:17 < XBOCT> the issue is more of just to do with the async nature of Node. if i query the first user to add their info; i have to query the second one after the first one returns
04:17 < XBOCT> and i can only send the response to the user when all the users have been queried
04:17 < gladoscc> ChessTeach: Let's say the bb code phraser takes 100 ms
04:18 < XBOCT> since i don't know how many users there are then how am i supposed to know when to send the response
04:18 < gladoscc> Maybe because you're passing 10 MB of data to it.
04:18 < gladoscc> The temp function means that the rest of your code can continue if another user sends a HTTP request.
04:18 < ChessTeach> what if i don't want it to?
04:18 < gladoscc> ChessTeach: well, use PHP then?
04:18 < ChessTeach> gladoscc: I understand now.... ok thanks
04:19 < ChessTeach> I didn't consider the other requests
04:19 < XBOCT> gladoscc: ok maybe you can answer me a completely unrelated thing
04:19 < gladoscc> "I don't like the amount of brackets used by lisp, what if I don't want to use it?"
04:19 < Hotroot> I am getting a very strange glitch with socket.io. I emit an array to the player (username + number) and it logs as having sent the array. When I console.log the event client side though, it shows that just a username string was sent
04:19 < gladoscc> sorry if I'm a bit rude
04:19 < XBOCT> how exactly does package.json work - how is it enforced?
04:19 < gladoscc> Hotroot: pastebin plz.
04:19 <@konobi> XBOCT: npm
04:19 < Hotroot> The project is largeish, but I'll paste the relevant bits
04:20 < gladoscc> yeah, npm should do it's magik
04:20 < XBOCT> konobi: so running 'npm' in my project's directory will verify that all the things in package.json correspond to what's there?
04:20 < XBOCT> that all the packages are the right versions?
04:20 <@konobi> XBOCT: no.. but you can read the npm docs
04:21 < XBOCT> alright ty
04:21 < gladoscc> XBOCT: http://blog.nodejitsu.com/npm-cheatsheet#Create_a_new_npm_package
04:21 < Hotroot> https://gist.github.com/49fe9267f641ecb7aacd
04:22 < Hotroot> gladoscc: There's the relevant bits
04:22 < gladoscc> Yeah
04:22 < gladoscc> socket.username, this.players[socket.username].seat is wrong
04:22 <@konobi> npm install, etc.
04:22 < gladoscc> Do this
04:22 < gladoscc> socket.emit('foo', {username: 'bar', blah: 'test'});
04:23 < gladoscc> You need to pass a JSON object for socket.emit.
04:23 < gladoscc> socket.broadcast.to(this.id).emit('newPlayer', {username: socket.username, seat: this.players[socket.username].seat});
04:23 < Hotroot> Hmm, my bad
04:23 <@konobi> that's not a json object
04:24 < Hotroot> Why does it look like an array in the server log though?
04:24 < gladoscc> konobi: that's not? :O
04:24 <@konobi> no... it's a javascript object
04:24 <@konobi> a json object is a string
04:24 < garbagecollectio> Hotroot, i had this problem too
04:24 < deoxxa> so what you're saying is that it's an object, written in javascript form... notation, if you will...
04:25 < garbagecollectio> its null
04:25 < gladoscc> yeah got confused :/
04:25 <@konobi> deoxxa: yeah... i just wanted to still a traffic ramp in there
04:25 < deoxxa> :P
04:25 < mscdex> emit all the things
04:25 < deoxxa> emit emitters
04:25 < deoxxa> this.emit("this", this);
04:26 < deoxxa> this.on("this", this.emit.bind(this, "this", this));
04:26 < gladoscc> I've always throught socket.io should rename emit to eject.
04:26 < gladoscc> Because I'll picture the server ejecting a CD drive of data.
04:26 < Hotroot> Tried wrapping the args with an array, works perfect, thanks
04:26 < gladoscc> :D
04:26 < Hotroot> Really a pain in the ass though that it logs as showing that it passed an array
04:27 < Hotroot> I figured it just created an array with the args passed
04:27 < deoxxa> the logging is the dumbest part of socket.io
04:27 < deoxxa> it's annoying, ugly and confusing
04:27 < gladoscc> I don't even know there IS logging for websocket requests.
04:27 < gladoscc> so I guess I'm lucky.
04:27 < zomg> deoxxa: not to mention logging in socket.io used to cause crashing
04:28 < deoxxa> haha
04:28 < zomg> not sure if it still does...
04:28 < deoxxa> that's lol
04:28 < deoxxa> wouldn't be surprised
04:28 < zomg> Forgot what the exact circumstances were but basically it would crash sometimes unless you disabled the logging entirely
04:28 < gladoscc> does anyone tend to get random buffer overflow errors as part of node.js?
04:29 < deoxxa> nnnno
04:29 < gladoscc> after you've being running it for a while and it just suddendly crashes.
04:29 < deoxxa> nope
04:29 < gladoscc> Okay, I'm going to guess it's to do with http proxy.
04:29 < deoxxa> i've got processes that have uptimes of nearly a year right now
04:29 < deoxxa> (0.4.12 ftw)
04:29 < Hotroot> haha, nice
04:30 < gladoscc> -.-
04:30 < gladoscc> I wonder what is the longest process uptime
04:30 < gladoscc> Like, any process at all, that is still up today.
04:30 < Hotroot> I've never found node to crash for reasons unrelated to my noobishness
04:30 < Hotroot> But I haven't tested that much
04:30 < gladoscc> Probably 30 years or so? One of those UNIX boxes tucked away in a corner?
04:31 < gladoscc> Hotroot: the thing is, it doesn't crash in my code, it crashes in node.js's internal code.
04:31 < deoxxa> gladoscc: http://www.uptimeprj.com/
04:31 < Hotroot> That's what I mean
04:31 < ChessTeach> I have some raw html saved in a variable now and I want to print it. I am inside an html file and using '{{variable}}' to output it. NodeJs is formatting it. How do I prevent this?
04:31 < gladoscc> deoxxa:  thanks :3
04:31 < Hotroot> deoxxa: That site looks horrible
04:31 < deoxxa> indeed it does!
04:31 < deoxxa> but they can't reboot to update
04:31 < deoxxa> so they have an excuse
04:31 < Hotroot> What is this, a font for ants?
04:31 < Hotroot> 4 size?
04:32 < gladoscc> hotroot: monitor DPI?
04:32 < Hotroot> I can't tell if this word says "Greek" or "Geek" the font is so small
04:32 < Hotroot> gladoscc: It's a shit monitor, probably at 10x7 or summat
04:32 < gladoscc> I don't see any problem with it on my 640x480 monitor.
04:32 < gladoscc> CRT.
04:33 < Hotroot> Everything is big at 6x4
04:33 < gladoscc> can't wait for a zombie apocolypse
04:33 < gladoscc> and you see people battling for uptimeprj.
04:34 < xangelo> anyone manage to upload a file to gdrive using nodejs?
04:36 < gladoscc> xangelo: Google Drive has a Javascript API.
04:36 < gladoscc> https://developers.google.com/drive/
04:36 < gladoscc> Shouldn't have any problems with it.
04:37 < garbagecollectio> this guy at work got into a fight with me
04:37 < garbagecollectio> after a happy hour
04:37 < garbagecollectio> and siad "your a fucking loser"
04:37 < garbagecollectio> "php what the fuck is that shit"
04:37 < garbagecollectio> "look at your hair, do u shower"
04:37 < deoxxa> lol burn
04:37 < deoxxa> did you cry deeply
04:37 < garbagecollectio> "i make 130k a year as a contractor and your a fucking level 2 engineer making what 60,70k?"
04:38 < gladoscc> garbagecollectio: where do you work?
04:38 < garbagecollectio> a fortune 50 company
04:38 < garbagecollectio> where this shit shouldnt be allowed to go on
04:38 < xangelo> gladoscc: yeah, I was hoping to avoid using the whole lib just for gdrive access,but ah wells
04:38 < gladoscc> xangelo: I have noticed that today's programming tends to involve libraries bigger than the actual code written.
04:39 < misterhat> does crypto support RSA?
04:39 < misterhat> node-rsa doesn't seem to work
04:40 < xangelo> gladoscc it's a dumb trend. 
04:40 < xangelo> gladoscc: perhaps I can at least figure out how they're doing it and maybe replicate it without their lib
04:40 < xangelo> thanks
04:40 < SomeoneWeird> garbagecollectio, if you're a contractor you don't work for them
04:40 < SomeoneWeird> just saying :)
04:40 < garbagecollectio> im an employer
04:40 < garbagecollectio> employee
04:41 < SomeoneWeird> then you're not a contractor
04:41 < garbagecollectio> who doesnt work for them
04:41 < garbagecollectio> no the other guy is a contractor
04:41 < SomeoneWeird> ic
04:41 < garbagecollectio> a code monkey
04:41 < SomeoneWeird> so you only make 60k?
04:41 < garbagecollectio> 70 yea
04:41 < SomeoneWeird> heh
04:41 < garbagecollectio> but im an employee
04:41 < garbagecollectio> whereas u just sit at home
04:41 < deoxxa> ...
04:41 < garbagecollectio> i have all sorts of insurance, a social world, perks
04:41 < garbagecollectio> a 401k
04:41 < SomeoneWeird> yeah, because i'm not employed
04:41 < garbagecollectio> that invests for me
04:41 < SomeoneWeird> asshole
04:41 < deoxxa> see this is what i'm talking about with your attitude, garbagecollectio
04:42 < garbagecollectio> why arent u employed
04:42 < SomeoneWeird> because i'm fucking 16
04:42 < garbagecollectio> why are there so many unemployed devs when 
04:42 < garbagecollectio> oh
04:42 < freewil> garbagecollectio> i have all sorts of insurance, a social world, perks <-- slave mindset
04:42 < garbagecollectio> what is NOT a slave mindset
04:42 < xangelo> bananas.
04:43 < Hotroot> See ya'll later. Good luck with Trolly McTroll Troll
04:43 < garbagecollectio> not a troll
04:43 < garbagecollectio> i am secure
04:43 < garbagecollectio> its not to have a job
04:44 < deoxxa> xangelo: that's accurate
04:44 < deoxxa> xangelo: bananas are definitely -not- a slave mindset
04:44 < gladoscc> garbagecollectio is now trying to start a fight with dex
04:44 < SomeoneWeird> You have fun being an employee while i become an entrepreneur and make in a month what you make in 5 years
04:45 < garbagecollectio> nope
04:45 < garbagecollectio> i will make more
04:45 < deoxxa> i already make more
04:45 < SomeoneWeird> 70k?
04:45 < gladoscc> do you enjoy what you are doing?
04:45 < SomeoneWeird> lold
04:45 < garbagecollectio> yeah
04:45 < garbagecollectio> someoneweird, u are unemployed
04:45 < garbagecollectio> so stfu
04:45 < garbagecollectio> plus
04:45 < garbagecollectio> u dont know shit about business
04:45 < SomeoneWeird> lollllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
04:45 < gladoscc> garbagecollectio: what do you do? 
04:45 < deoxxa> lolol
04:45 < SomeoneWeird> lollllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
04:45 < deoxxa> garbagecollectio: you're adorable
04:45 < garbagecollectio> u have dreams that are imbued by you from your mother
04:45 < gladoscc> writing a crud interface?
04:45 < SomeoneWeird> im sitting here laughing
04:45 < garbagecollectio> maybe ur mom can bring u milkk and cookies
04:45 < gladoscc> -.-
04:45 < garbagecollectio> "oh one day u will be an entreprenuer'
04:46 < deoxxa> i want milk and cookies
04:46 < garbagecollectio> u cant create anything someone weird
04:46 < garbagecollectio> nothing beautiful, at least
04:46 < garbagecollectio> and ur friends know it
04:46 < SomeoneWeird> garbagecollectio, lol dude, i have people offering me internships constantly, and have investors lined up for about $2m for a project i'm doing
04:46 < deoxxa> can i get milk and cookies
04:46 < garbagecollectio> lol no u dont
04:46 < deoxxa> hey
04:46 < JohnnyL> any of you know when 1.0 will cometh?
04:46 < gladoscc> SomeoneWeird: are you Kim Dotcom?
04:46 < deoxxa> listen
04:46 < deoxxa> milk and cookies
04:46 < deoxxa> where are they
04:46 < SomeoneWeird> lol
04:46  * gladoscc brings deoxxa milk and cookies
04:46 < deoxxa> do want
04:46 < SomeoneWeird> not quite gladoscc 
04:46 < garbagecollectio> wow a lyign 16 year old on IRC, never would have thought
04:46 < garbagecollectio> u wont even go to college somoenweird
04:46 < SomeoneWeird> funny
04:46 < garbagecollectio> and u will want to
04:46 < garbagecollectio> but u cant 
04:46 < garbagecollectio> go
04:46 < garbagecollectio> cause ur dumb!!
04:46 < SomeoneWeird> no, i've already graduated
04:46 < garbagecollectio> lol
04:47 < gladoscc> Hey garbagecollectio, I'm 14.
04:47 < SomeoneWeird> advanced diploma, dick
04:47 < garbagecollectio> what was ur major?
04:47 < SomeoneWeird> computer systems engineering and network security
04:47 < gladoscc> zzz
04:47 < garbagecollectio> ok so if that's true then tell me about how the event loop works
04:47 < SomeoneWeird> i'm just sitting here laughing
04:47 < SomeoneWeird> lmao you couldn't even answer that before
04:47 < misterhat> ugh
04:47 < misterhat> npm stopped working
04:47 < misterhat> :(
04:48 < garbagecollectio> 5,4,3,2,1...
04:48 < deoxxa> <garbagecollectio> u wont even go to college somoenweird
04:48 < misterhat> says it can't find node path
04:48 < deoxxa> ...who needs that
04:48 < SomeoneWeird> obviously him
04:48 < deoxxa> lol i failed high school
04:48 < SomeoneWeird> http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dy_ZmM7zPLyI&h=vAQE8vL9a
04:48 < garbagecollectio> and thats why u are losers
04:48 < deoxxa> formal education != important
04:48 < SomeoneWeird> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_ZmM7zPLyI
04:48 < SomeoneWeird> ^^^^^^
04:48 < SomeoneWeird> ^^^^^
04:48 < SomeoneWeird> watch that
04:48 < garbagecollectio> even if u "make money"
04:48 < SomeoneWeird> watch it
04:49 < garbagecollectio> lol formal educatoin is super important
04:49 < gladoscc> deoxxa: ++
04:49 < garbagecollectio> u cant think logically
04:49 < garbagecollectio> ur like apes
04:49 < SomeoneWeird> lmao no it's not
04:49 < deoxxa> haha
04:49 < gladoscc> I'm not even paying attention to high school atm.
04:49 < garbagecollectio> super important
04:49 < gladoscc> spend half of my school time coding
04:49 < SomeoneWeird> says the guy who calls himself a senior programmer
04:49 < SomeoneWeird> who only makes 70k
04:49  * deoxxa taps konobi
04:49 < garbagecollectio> i said im not a senior programmer
04:49 < garbagecollectio> read!
04:49 < SomeoneWeird> gladoscc, yep that's exactly what i do/did
04:49 < gladoscc> The only problem is I'm not really enjoying programming
04:49 < garbagecollectio> programming sucks
04:49 < SomeoneWeird> "THEY DONT THINK I'M SENIOR ENOUGH"
04:50 < SomeoneWeird> "I THINK I'M SENIOR ENOUGH"
04:50 < SomeoneWeird> "WHY DIDNT I GET THE JOB"
04:50 < garbagecollectio> yeah ido
04:50 < misterhat> Checking for node path                   : not found 
04:50 < misterhat> fixxx
04:50 < SomeoneWeird> normally you can ignore that
04:50  * gladoscc gets out Easy-Fix
04:50  * gladoscc sprays canister
04:50 < misterhat> i'm trying to install a module globall
04:50 < misterhat> globally*
04:50 < gladoscc> there, should be working now.
04:50 < SomeoneWeird> export NODE_PATH=/path/to/node
04:50 < wolfes> a young person's guide to quitting your day job http://arbor.posterous.com/i-quit-my-high-paying-job-what-now (not written by me, but seems fitting for the lively chat in node tonight)
04:51 < misterhat> where is my node path though :P
04:51 < misterhat> npm is supposed to find it!! :(
04:51 < xangelo> sometimes I stare at public api
04:51 < gladoscc> SomeoneWeird: I have a feeling it is where node.js is installed.
04:51 < gladoscc> whereis or whatever the func is called
04:51 < xangelo> and I'm all 'wtf man.'
04:51 < gladoscc> misterhat: whereis node
04:51 < deoxxa> xangelo: i know that feel
04:51 < SomeoneWeird> export NODE_PATH=(which node)
04:52 < misterhat> node: /usr/bin/node
04:52 < SomeoneWeird> maybe
04:52 < SomeoneWeird> yeah
04:52 < wolfes> xangelo: i had that earlier today with http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/magic-functions-and-variables/
04:52 < misterhat> k
04:52 < gladoscc> Now, NODE_PATH=/user/bin/node does that work?
04:52 < misterhat> let's find out
04:52 < wolfes> Opera Extension has: opera.defineMagicFunction()
04:52 < gladoscc> No
04:52 < gladoscc> You have to cast a wiccan spell first.
04:52 < gladoscc> Magick.
04:52 < misterhat> nope gladoscc
04:52 < gladoscc> :/
04:52 < misterhat> echo $NODE_PATH
04:52 < wolfes> I really wanted: opera.defineUnicornFunction, but all i could get was MagicVariable and MagicFunction
04:52 < misterhat> oh wait
04:52 < SomeoneWeird> export NODE_PATH=/usr/bin/node
04:53 < misterhat> yeah ik
04:53 < misterhat> alright now let's try
04:53 < gladoscc> this is why I don't like using a lot of libraries.
04:53 < misterhat> NOPE
04:53 < misterhat> :(
04:53 < SomeoneWeird> pastie the entire error
04:53 < gladoscc> when I was coding asctionscript
04:53 < misterhat> Checking for node path                   : not found 
04:53 < gladoscc> zero libraries
04:53 < misterhat> that's it SomeoneWeird
04:53 < gladoscc> I'm so macho.
04:53 < misterhat> like
04:53 < SomeoneWeird> what module?
04:53 < misterhat> everything else is in green
04:53 < misterhat> nrsa
04:53 < SomeoneWeird> os?
04:54 < misterhat> ubuntu
04:54 < gladoscc> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13375357/proper-use-cases-for-android-usermanager-isuseragoat
04:54  * gladoscc highfives misterhat
04:54 < wolfes> isuseragoat?
04:54 < gladoscc> ubuntu is the only os that actually works on UEFI when booted from a usb stick
04:54 < gladoscc> false
04:54 < SomeoneWeird> you sure/
04:54 < SomeoneWeird> *?
04:54 < SomeoneWeird> debian, fedora etc?
04:54 < xangelo> wolfes: wah?! :O
04:54 < misterhat> wat
04:54 < misterhat> me?
04:55 < gladoscc> SomeoneWeird: tried fedora
04:55 < gladoscc> doesn't work.
04:55 < mscdex> misterhat: this is delayed, but yes node crypto supports rsa
04:56 < misterhat> oh that's fine
04:56 < misterhat> i couldn't find any documentation
04:56 < misterhat> does it support it 100%?
04:56  * gladoscc wondered where konobi was and where he left the kickbakhammar
04:56 < misterhat> because i'm seeing these outdated libraries
04:56 < misterhat> which i'd rather not use if i don't have to
04:56 < gladoscc> lol garbage
04:56 < mscdex> yeah, openssl supports it
04:56 < mscdex> and dsa
04:56 < mscdex> at least
04:56 < misterhat> well i have to use rsa
04:56 < mscdex> right
04:57 < mscdex> rsa is better
04:57 < misterhat> where can i find the documentation
04:57 < gladoscc> Anyone coding on a mac?
04:57 < misterhat> the api didn't say anything about rsa
04:57 < gladoscc> I mean
04:57 < gladoscc> Anyone coding on a iPad?
04:57 < wolfes> android fn: isUserAMonkey - http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ActivityManager.html#isUserAMonkey
04:57 < mscdex> misterhat: what are you wanting to do with the key exactly ?
04:57 < gladoscc> wolfes: https://www.google.com/search?q=easter+egg
04:57 < misterhat> mscdex: i need to decode rsa sent to me
04:57 < SomeoneWeird> <*buffextras> [04:54:33] garbagecollectio!~erere@c-68-81-255-153.hsd1.pa.comcast.net quit with message: [Quit: garbagecollectio]
04:57 < misterhat> i've got the key
04:57 < misterhat> private key
04:57 < SomeoneWeird> lol
04:58 < SomeoneWeird> use the crypto module?
04:58 < SomeoneWeird> anyway you shouldn't install modules globally
04:58 < misterhat> i said before i couldn't find any documentation
04:58 < misterhat> with rsa
04:58 < gladoscc> misterhat: if you're not sure how to do something involving crypto, it's probably a good idea to not attempt doing it.
04:58 < mscdex> misterhat: well the binary key data is the key in the Decipher
04:59 < xangelo> btw, if anyone cares, forget that js lib for accessing stuff off gdrive. I've got a super simple upload working utilizing the request module
04:59 < SomeoneWeird> gladoscc, not all the time
04:59 < SomeoneWeird> i know how stuff works, I just don't know how to implement it in node :)
04:59 < SomeoneWeird> etc.
04:59 < gladoscc> SomeoneWeird: yeah, if you're learning or testing there's no problem
04:59 < misterhat> hm
04:59 < misterhat> yeah does seem like it should work
05:00 < gladoscc> awesome!
05:00 < wolfes> jQuery + http://konamicodesites.com/
05:00 < misterhat> i'll do some experimenting :P
05:00 < SomeoneWeird> we really need a good pubpriv crypto lib
05:00 < wolfes> are there other easter eggs like the konami code that major websites use?
05:00 < mscdex> misterhat: but it all depends though what is really the key and what's the iv
05:01 < SomeoneWeird> that has higher level functions than crypto
05:01 < mscdex> SomeoneWeird: like what?
05:01 < mscdex> crypto does have some key and cert-related functions, but node does not expose them
05:01 < gladoscc> apple should support it
05:01 < mscdex> that's why i did a lot of stuff myself for ssh2 :-)
05:01 < SomeoneWeird> eh, var keys = createNewKeys(), var encrypted = keys.encrypt(somebodyelsespublickey, data);
05:01 < SomeoneWeird> etc.
05:01 < misterhat> yeah so i would use createCipher
05:02 < misterhat> correct?
05:02 < SomeoneWeird> hmm it does?
05:02 < SomeoneWeird> yes 
05:02 < mscdex> misterhat: createDecipher if you're deciphering...
05:02 < misterhat> alright
05:02 < misterhat> kk yeah
05:02 < SomeoneWeird> lol, ya
05:02 < misterhat> and what would be the algo name
05:02 < mscdex> SomeoneWeird: s/crypto/openssl
05:02 < SomeoneWeird> oh,
05:02 < SomeoneWeird> yeah
05:02 < SomeoneWeird> lol
05:02 < SomeoneWeird> that much i knew :p
05:02 < SomeoneWeird> but I don't know c++ so stuff that lol
05:03 < gladoscc> SomeoneWeird: you should learn it.. chances are you'll touch it someday.
05:03 < mscdex> misterhat: that's the encryption algorithm for the encrypted data
05:03 < mscdex> misterhat: e.g. aes-128-cbc, etc
05:03 < SomeoneWeird> yeah probably gladoscc 
05:03 < misterhat> wait
05:03 < misterhat> RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding
05:04 < mscdex> ew ECB
05:04 < mscdex> :S
05:04 < misterhat> yeah i know
05:04 < misterhat> i can't change it though
05:04 < misterhat> i've gotta use it lol
05:04 < misterhat> is it still possible?
05:05 < mscdex> should be, i think openssl supports ecb
05:05 < misterhat> how would i define that
05:05 < misterhat> or where can i start looking :P
05:05 < mscdex> still need the algorithm though
05:05 < mscdex> like aes, 3des, etc
05:06 < mscdex> rc4
05:06 < mscdex> what is it you're trying to do at a higher level?
05:07 < mscdex> is there a protocol here you're working on or ?
05:07 < misterhat> no
05:07 < misterhat> client is sending me this ugly chunk of RSA encoded mess
05:07 < SomeoneWeird> openssl supports aes-256-ecb 
05:07 < SomeoneWeird> which is maybe what you're after
05:08 < misterhat> so i would need to use that
05:08 < misterhat> RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding
05:08 < misterhat> that'd support that ^?
05:08 < mscdex> it doesn't have to be aes
05:08 < mscdex> you need to know for sure
05:08 < SomeoneWeird> SO I'M GOING TO LEARN C++
05:08 < SomeoneWeird> AND I'M GOING TO REGRET THIS
05:08 < misterhat> hold on
05:08 < misterhat> i need a decrypt mode
05:09 < misterhat> hm
05:09 < misterhat> no that's all it is lol
05:09 < misterhat> it's RSA with "RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding"
05:09 < mscdex> it could be aes-128-ecb, aes-192-ecb, aes-256-ecb, cast5-ecb, camellia-128-ecb, etc. ...
05:09 < misterhat> looking @ openssl idk if it supports it
05:09 < misterhat> yeah i'm looking now @ openssl
05:10 < misterhat> mscdex: how do i get that padding in too?
05:10 < mscdex> there's a setAutoPadding or something
05:10 < misterhat> that'd take care of PKCS1
05:10 < misterhat> alright
05:11 < JohnnyL> does node.js automagically handle multicore?
05:11 < SomeoneWeird> no
05:11 < SomeoneWeird> node is single threaded
05:11 < s5fs> JohnnyL: node find one core it likes and they go steady.
05:12 < JohnnyL> can't you spouts multiple process in a loop?
05:12 < JohnnyL> -s
05:12 < SomeoneWeird> yes
05:12 < misterhat> hmm
05:13 < JohnnyL> then you are both right and wrong.
05:13 < misterhat> you're right mscdex idk which one it is there
05:13 < SomeoneWeird> JohnnyL?
05:14 < mscdex> misterhat: is the key you're given in PEM format?
05:14 < misterhat> not sure
05:14 < misterhat> let's see
05:15 < mscdex> look at the ascii representation and you'll know
05:15 < misterhat> yeah i've got the ascii
05:15 < gladoscc> Guys http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/explorer.html
05:15 < misterhat> idk if it's pem
05:15 < mscdex> does it start with hyphens?
05:15 < misterhat> no
05:15 < misterhat> it's all numbers
05:15 < SomeoneWeird> then it's not
05:15 < mscdex> ok, then it's not :-)
05:15 < misterhat> alright
05:15 < misterhat> 1263892302308
05:15 < misterhat> etc.
05:15 < misterhat> it's not that short :P
05:16 < mscdex> probably DER encoded
05:16 < misterhat> der
05:16 < misterhat> ok
05:16 < SomeoneWeird> lol
05:16 < misterhat> what would i use for der
05:16 < misterhat> der ecb
05:16 < JohnnyL> does webworkers work in node.js?
05:16 < misterhat> there's a library for it JohnnyL
05:16 < misterhat> module
05:17 < mscdex> JohnnyL: you can use the built-in cluster module
05:17 < mscdex> and/or built-in child_process module
05:17 < misterhat> really curious which one to use 
05:18 < misterhat> not as simple as i thought 
05:18 < misterhat> :p
05:18 < JohnnyL> okay
05:19 < mscdex> misterhat: sounds like there's some missing info
05:19 < misterhat> i've got the java class i'm trying to convert
05:19  * mscdex shakes a fist at Java
05:19 < misterhat> yes ye
05:19 < misterhat> but that's why i'm trying to get rid of it :P
05:20 < mscdex> is this an open source java class?
05:20 < misterhat> i can send it to you
05:20 < misterhat> pastebin
05:21 < misterhat> http://pastebin.com/i9THJYKi
05:21 < misterhat> i left out the key
05:21 < misterhat> but yeah that was it
05:23 < misterhat> mscdex: you got it? that's all the info that was there
05:23 < misterhat> perhaps java's uses one by default or something 
05:26 < misterhat> so yeah the only algo it gave was RSA lol
05:28 < mscdex> what's the byte size of your key?
05:29 < misterhat> i'll check
05:29 < misterhat> 1528
05:36 < misterhat> mscdex: find anything?
05:44 < dawra> hey
05:44 < dawra> https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres#evented-api
05:44 < dawra> will i have to do this on every web reqeust (using express.js)
05:44 < dawra> var client = new pg.Client(conString);
05:44 < dawra> client.connect();
05:50 < dawra> someone there
05:55 < misterhat> mscdex: :((
05:58 < daleharvey> is there a 'broken internet' proxy in node?
05:59 < daleharvey> basically a reverse proxy that screws up your requests in a similiar way that normal internet traffic does, I guess it would mostly just be setTimeout(doProxy, math.random())
05:59 < daleharvey> type thing
06:12 < distilledchaos> Does jade expose an API for post-processing the jade?  For example, if I wanted to automatically concatenate all adjacent css or javascript files included from a jade file, could I do so?
06:12 < distilledchaos> Also, does such a solution already exist with jade in mind?
06:22 < misterhat> mscdex: well msg me when you're back please
06:23 < JohnnyL> anyone need a programmer?
06:23 < JohnnyL> looking to make a few bucks
06:24 < JohnnyL> bye
06:30 < distilledchaos> Does jade expose an API for post-processing the jade?  For example, if I wanted to automatically concatenate all adjacent css or javascript files included from a jade file, could I do so?
06:30 < distilledchaos> Also, does such a solution already exist with jade in mind?
06:38 < misterhat> damn
06:38 < misterhat> well i guess node.js doesn't support RSA
06:46 < distilledchaos> misterhat: what leads you to that conclusion?
06:46 < misterhat> been looking for a while
06:46 < distilledchaos> If the built-in crypto module doesn't meet your needs, check out https://github.com/chrisa/node-rsa
06:46 < misterhat> can't find anything on it
06:47 < misterhat> i did check it out
06:47 < misterhat> won't work
06:47 < misterhat> i need to decrypt err
06:47 < distilledchaos> crypto is rather finnicky on how you pass it keys and the like
06:47 < misterhat> RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding
06:47 < distilledchaos> that does complicate things
06:47 < misterhat> but i couldn't find anything for RSA on openssl list-cipher-algorithms
06:48 < misterhat> very disappointing distilledchaos :P
06:49 < distilledchaos> I'm sorry :(
06:49 < distilledchaos> what do you need it for?
06:49 < dawra> using node postgres
06:49 < dawra> https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres#evented-api
06:49 < misterhat> just trying to decrypt data sent by client distilledchaos
06:49 < dawra> var client = new pg.Client(conString);
06:49 < misterhat> why isn't there a way to do this?
06:49 < dawra> client.connect();
06:50 < dawra> do i have tod o on every web reqeust usng express.js
06:51 < staar2> is there any example for express js and everyauth ?
06:51 < distilledchaos> misterhat: node.js is still rather young.  I was trying to do some more complicated things with encryption and node, ended up using the child_process module and writing the bulk of the code in java.
06:52 < dawra> NO ONE?
06:52 < distilledchaos> staar2 a quick google search finds this: https://github.com/abelmartin/Express-And-Everyauth
06:52 < misterhat> isn't it openssl that isn't doing it?
06:52 < misterhat> for some strange reason
06:52 < misterhat> or does it have some stupid name
06:53 < distilledchaos> dawra: I don't know much about node-postgres, but disconnecting your database on every request won't help anything
06:53 < misterhat> i still can't believe that isn't possible
06:53 < misterhat> crazy
06:53 < misterhat> i thought RSA was pretty standard stuff by now
06:54 < distilledchaos> it is, but the format with which one stores RSA keys is nonstandard
06:54 < distilledchaos> so I guess...not so much
06:55 < dawra> distilledchaos: hm
06:55 < dawra> so when should i end the connection?
06:55 < dawra> should i never call client.end() /
06:56 < dawra> ?
06:56 < distilledchaos> dawra: quick question: are you coming from a different language?
06:56 < distilledchaos> like PHP or something?
06:56 < dawra> yes
06:56 < distilledchaos> keep in mind that your node.js application is running constantly, not just when a request is made
06:56 < distilledchaos> so you want to call client.end() when your server shuts down
06:57 < dawra> i have used mongodb with node, didnt have to disconnect and the connection remained open forever. but not sure with mysql and postgres, should i do same?
06:57 < distilledchaos> yes
06:57 < distilledchaos> most clients will auto-disconnect
06:57 < dawra> using express app, how do i check when client shuts down?
06:57 < misterhat> oo wait distilledchaos
06:57 < misterhat> i may have found something
06:58 < misterhat> gotta confirm first
06:58 < misterhat> :P
06:58 < distilledchaos> misterhat: cool
06:58 < dawra> server shuts down*
06:58 < distilledchaos> dawra: hold on a sec
06:58 < dawra> actually i am confused
06:58 < dawra> what if postfres crashes for some reason and get backs up after 5 mins ornever gets back up
06:58 < dawra> my node app will keep on crashing then i think
06:59 < misterhat> distilledchaos: https://github.com/ragnar-johannsson/rsautl
06:59 < distilledchaos> dawra: the database clients i've used will automatically reconnect
06:59 < distilledchaos> you shouldn't need to worry about it
07:00 < dawra> but what if it doesnt reconnects for 5 mins and some requests have been made in that time
07:00 < distilledchaos> misterhat: if that works, great!  you may find that it doesn't know what to do with your RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding encoded keys, though
07:00 < dawra> i might be talking stupid
07:00 < dawra> its just a little confusing
07:01 < misterhat> distilledchaos: i thiiink it's the default
07:01 < misterhat> or it should be configurable 
07:01 < distilledchaos> i hope so :)
07:02 < misterhat> https://github.com/Obvious/ursa
07:02 < distilledchaos> dawra: if you want to listen for signals that cause your application to end, try listening for the 'SIGINT' and 'SIGTERM' events on process
07:02 < misterhat>  decrypt(buf, bufEncoding, outEncoding, padding)
07:02 < misterhat> !!!!
07:02 < misterhat> that's what i need!
07:02 < misterhat> The mode ursa.RSA_PKCS1_PADDING is also supported.
07:02 < distilledchaos> i.e. process.on('SIGINT', function() {});
07:02 < distilledchaos> sweet
07:02 < distilledchaos> i guess you're set then XD
07:02 < misterhat> ECB though..
07:02 < misterhat> ugh
07:03 < misterhat> well we'll see
07:03 < distilledchaos> good luck
07:04 < vslinko_> https://gist.github.com/4239047
07:06 < vslinko_> anyone? i'm spent 2 hours on this error :(
07:07 < dawra> i am still confused
07:08 < dawra> when should i call client.end ? :S
07:08 < dawra> client.end()
07:08 < dawra> btw, when the node app crashes for some reaosn, the connection will also end yeh?
07:08 < distilledchaos> dawra: don't bother, you shouldn't need to
07:10 < distilledchaos> dawra: yes, even if it doesn't manage to get off a disconnect signal, the server will realize the client is gona
07:10 < distilledchaos> gone*
07:10 < dawra> lets say pg goes down for a few seconds and comes back and after that 1 web request comes. the thing is, old connection had terminated but node kept on running. now how will node ake a new connection since thats only done on startup?
07:13 < dawra> distilledchaos: get me?
07:13 < MI6> joyent/libuv: Ben Noordhuis master * b4168cd : build: rename LINKFLAGS to LDFLAGS (+1 more commits) - http://git.io/Mk3gvg
07:14 < freewil> dawra, assuming your using pg.connect() to use the connection pool... if pg went down it would terminate all 10 connections that the pool uses by default
07:14 < freewil> but it should start up the connection pool again next request that calls pg.connect()
07:15 < misterhat> nope
07:15 < misterhat> didn't work
07:15 < distilledchaos> dawra: pg.connect() is the only time you explicitly tell it to connect, but if the socket closes it will (or at least should) automatically reconnect--and retry in the case of failure
07:15 < misterhat> PEM only
07:16 < distilledchaos> misterhat: :(
07:18 < misterhat> both expect PEM
07:18 < misterhat> wtf
07:19 < dawra> freewil: hmm, should we call pg.connectonly on startup or also on every web reqeust?
07:19 < distilledchaos> I seem to recall being able to convert
07:19 < freewil> dawra, only call it when you need to do a query
07:19 < distilledchaos> dawra: call pg.connect only at startup, it should just work...
07:19 < distilledchaos> wait
07:19 < distilledchaos> why would you do that?
07:19 < dawra> yeh now i am more confused
07:19 < distilledchaos> connect once, query when necessary
07:19 < freewil> pg.connect() uses a connection pool (10 connections by default)
07:20 < freewil> so pg.connect() will give you a free connection from the pool
07:20 < dawra> so if pg.connet() is called on 20 web request it will still use 10 ?
07:20 < dawra> reuse old ?
07:20 < freewil> yes
07:20 < distilledchaos> ah, interesting
07:20 < dawra> is it same with mysql, mongo, etc. in node?
07:20 < freewil> not sure ive only used pg
07:20 < distilledchaos> i've only used mongo and redis
07:20 < distilledchaos> they certainly don't do it that way
07:21 < distilledchaos> connect once, and you get a client object
07:21 < distilledchaos> then use the client object to query
07:21 < freewil> you can create a manual connection doing new pg.Client()
07:21 < dawra> ok so i changed my code to just do this, not using .end() anymore anywhere
07:21 < freewil> but that isnt recommended for web requests
07:21 < dawra> it works fine, let me restart postgres and see what happens
07:22 < dawra> nodecannot take requests after i restart postgres :P
07:23 < dawra> so this is definitely not a good way
07:23 < freewil> what does that mean?
07:23 < freewil> it cant take requests?
07:23 < dawra> it crashes
07:23 < freewil> thrown error?
07:24 < dawra> yeh "error: terminating connection due to administrator command"
07:24 < freewil> does it crash as soon as you kill postgres
07:24 < freewil> or on the first request afterwards
07:25 < dawra> as soon as i kill postgres
07:26 < dawra> ok so how can one combat such situations?
07:27 < dawra> pg might restart for some reason, how to prevent node from crashing atleast if theres no web request
07:27 < dawra> just keep safe
07:27 < dawra> just to*
07:28 < freewil> you might be able to prevent that by adding an event handler for 'error'
07:28 < freewil> https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/wiki/pg
07:28 < freewil> down at the bottom
07:29 < gladoscc> a tree crashed down onto our garage and damaged it severely
07:29 < gladoscc> now I'm wondering if I'm going to foot up the bill or if it's my neighbour's problem
07:30 < dawra> freewil: ok and then what to do so that it connects back when pg is up or maybe on the next web request?
07:31 < freewil> dawra, yeah i would think that it should re-establish the pool next time you call pg.connect() which should be the next request
07:31 < freewil> just need to figure out how to handle the error when pg goes down
07:32 < dawra> i am manually creating a client and connecting that with pg.Client
07:33 < freewil> thats not a good idea
07:33 < dawra> i need to figure out what kind of call to make from my routes so that it only calls the connect on the driver when the client is dead or smth. since if its not dead it crashes node
07:33 < freewil> you can easily exhaust postgres connections that way - even if you are careful about calling client.end()
07:33 < freewil> and then you have the overhead of creating a new connection every time
07:33 < dawra> i see
07:40 <@Nexxy> \o/
07:41 < yawnt> nope
07:41 <@Nexxy> yep.
07:41 < yawnt> nope.png
07:41 < gildean> why not
07:41 < yawnt> cause yes
07:45 < dawra> freewil: is there a way to check whether a client is connected or not if using pg.Client
07:46 < gladoscc> nexxy
07:48 <@Nexxy> gladoscc, 
07:48 < gladoscc> pong
07:49 <@Nexxy> gladoscc, did I ping you?
07:50 < gladoscc> Nexxy: nope.
07:50 < freewil> dawra, if you're doing that and not using the pool you can pass an optional callback to client.connect()
07:50 < freewil> and the error event should be emitted if the connection dies
07:51 < freewil> https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/wiki/Client#method-connect
07:51 < dawra> hm so i can keep a flag and do if else
07:51 <@Nexxy> gladoscc, oh, what's up?
07:52 < gladoscc> Squashing a bug that shouldn't exist :/
07:52 < dawra> although now i realize its bettert to use the pool since my way will only have 1 connection tat can be busy leading to bigger queue under heavy load,. while the pooling mechanism will manage stuff heh :P
07:53 < dawra> am i right in assuming that freewil ?
07:53 < tacirus> Hello, I`v just started to learn node.js basics. There`s a thing I don`t get: say I do       response.write("Hello world!");     I request "localhost:8888", the message is shown . It`s ok.  Then I go and change the message in the file to something like "Bye world"  and I refresh the browser page but the message is "Hello world " all the same. Why is that so?
07:54 < distilledchaos> Because you didn't restart the server?
07:54 < tacirus> yep I didn`t
07:54 < freewil> dawra, yes if you're going to be handling web requests then the pool is the way to go
07:54 < freewil> i manually create clients for some batch jobs/cronjobs
07:54 < freewil> but def not web requests
07:55 < tacirus> I thought it should work without restarting cause the browser requests and the server shoud repond with the new message.
07:55 < dawra> ok thank you
07:56 < SomeoneWeird> is it reading a file each request tacirus ?
07:56 < tacirus> SomeoneWeird: the browser?
07:56  * gladoscc wonders what's fun about coding.
07:58 < gildean> gladoscc: it is fun to create something
07:59 < gildean> tacirus: if your response is inline in the server itself, it's read only once when the server starts
07:59 < gladoscc> gildean: what do you mean by something? I don't really feel it..
08:00 < gladoscc> when I first started it was fun to learn and explore stuff.
08:00 < tacirus> gildean: yes it`s inline. Well thinking over I start to get things 
08:00 < gildean> gladoscc: well, maybe programming just isn't for you
08:00 < gildean> gladoscc: i'm sure some ditch needs digging somewhere
08:01 < freewil> you lack passion
08:01 < freewil> are you working on something you care about?
08:01 <@Nexxy> way to be encouraging, guys
08:02 < freewil> trying to be encouraging... if you're working on someone else's project it's hard to be passionate about anything
08:02 <@Nexxy> freewil, lol yeah I was mostly responding to gildean's comment
08:02 < freewil> lol yeah
08:02 <@Nexxy> OH, FRUSTRATED? PROGRAMMING ISN'T YOUR KIND OF BAG, GO DO SOME MANUAL LABOR
08:03 < gladoscc> freewil: good point.. I'm getting paid to do it through.
08:04 < freewil> yes that is why you get paid
08:04 < dawra> freewil: pg.error is undefined btw
08:04 < freewil> ive found id rather be poor and work on things i like
08:05 < wookiehangover> commie
08:05 < gildean> Nexxy: i was just joking and trying to provoke some emotion
08:05 < freewil> because then i dont think you'll be poor
08:05 < gildean> seems it worked
08:05 < freewil> nothing commie about it
08:05 < freewil> it's individualistic as anything
08:05 < dawra> nvm
08:05 < gladoscc> I just see qutie a bit of people going "Most programmers would love to do it even if they didn't get paid."
08:06 < gildean> gladoscc: i think most do, but it's only true for their own projects
08:06 < staar2> well the everyauth middleware does not catch any of the auth redirects where could be the problem 
08:06 < staar2> ?
08:06 < freewil> sure if you like what you're doing
08:06 <@konobi> get out! rebel! up the <accornymhere>!
08:06 <@konobi> what?
08:06 < guybrush> freewil i see it similar :D being poor and doing what you like > not being poor and not doing what you like
08:07 < freewil> amen
08:07 <@Nexxy> but you're forgetting the obvious
08:07 < gladoscc> guybrush: not being homeless > being poor and doing what you like, lol
08:07 <@Nexxy> not being poor *and* doing what you like
08:07 <@konobi> gladoscc: in your opinion
08:07 < guybrush> gladoscc: being poor does not exclude having a home
08:07 <@Nexxy> home is where the heart is
08:08 < gladoscc> guybrush: yeah, I think I should subsitute poor with wealthless
08:08 < freewil> i was working at an office and felt like a drone, so i quit and then was working for some bullshit entertainment startup i didnt care about, now i am pretty poor but i enjoy life much more now
08:08 < dawra> freewil: i am done, but i am a little curious about mysql module https://github.com/felixge/node-mysql#server-disconnects
08:08 <@konobi> gladoscc: says the person on irc...
08:08 < dawra> that example reconnects right after loosing the connection, is that reliable?
08:09 < gladoscc> konobi: just using it as an example :)
08:09 < dawra> just wondering
08:09 < freewil> dawra, not sure - never used it
08:09 < gladoscc> dawra: what do you mean by reliable?
08:10 < dawra> gladoscc: it tries to create connection as soon as say the server has gone down.
08:10 < dawra> i mean the server might get back after sometime
08:10 <@konobi> Nexxy: i've had a crap end of week... please lemme know if i get unreasonable this weekend
08:10 < dawra> so that code isnt reliable/wont work, might even throw error
08:10 < gladoscc> It keeps connecting.
08:10 < gladoscc> > handleDisconnect(connection);
08:10 < dawra> ooo
08:10 <@Nexxy> konobi, I will do so
08:10 <@konobi> ta
08:10 < gladoscc> New connection has the same handler, so if MySQL isn't up yet, it'll costantly try.
08:10 < SomeoneWeird> is there a proper gpg module for node?
08:11 <@Nexxy> also I hope you feel better soon :)
08:11 < dawra> ah didnt notice that :S
08:11 < gladoscc> Personally, I don't think I'll encounter a mysql crash :/
08:11 < dawra> so it does handleDisconnect(connection)
08:11 < gladoscc> SomeoneWeird: have you looked into https://github.com/drudge/node-gpg ?
08:12 < dawra> which againt executes the connection onerror stuff
08:12 < gladoscc> Not sure if it's stable / working.
08:12 < dawra> so if mysql isnt up, that event will get called immediately?
08:12 < SomeoneWeird> yeah ofc, it's just a wrapper that barely works
08:12 < freewil> i actually did quite a bit of work on that module
08:13 < SomeoneWeird> >.>
08:13 < gladoscc> dawra: I'm not too sure - have you tried to test it by just shutting down mysqld?
08:13 < freewil> it's just a simple wrapper that uses the cli
08:13 < gladoscc> And seeing what happens.
08:13 < SomeoneWeird> ya
08:13 < dawra> gladoscc: well nope, maybe i should. i just moved from mysql to postgres yesterday to make my app work on heorku and now too lazy to try mysql again :D
08:13 < dawra> but i get it anyway, i assume the .connect will call errro event if ti cant connect
08:13 < dawra> so ok :)
08:14 < freewil> SomoneWeird, i havent tried this out yet but it actually uses c++ bindings
08:14 < gladoscc> dawra: yes.
08:14 < gladoscc> "connection.on('error'"
08:14 < gladoscc> If it could not connect to mysql, there will be an error, I would think.
08:14 < dawra> right tgotcha thankls :)
08:14 < SomeoneWeird> freewil, hm?
08:14 < freewil> https://github.com/eschulte/node-gpg
08:15 < gladoscc> Did youtube just change their layout?
08:15 < gkatsev> yes
08:15 < gkatsev> yesteday
08:15 < gladoscc> -.-
08:15 < freewil> hate the social icons
08:16 < freewil> avatars
08:16 < freewil> liked it more simple
08:16 < gkatsev> I do like the clean-ness of the player itself, though
08:17 <@konobi> Nexxy: no... someone must pay!
08:17  * konobi smash
08:17  * gladoscc dodges
08:17 -!- ryah was kicked from #Node.js by konobi [hulkMAD]
08:18 <@konobi> oh heh, not autorejoin... whoops
08:18 < freewil> lol
08:18 < freewil> not cool
08:18 <@Nexxy> LOL oh wow
08:19 <@konobi> was, at some point
08:19 -!- mode/#node.js [+o ryah] by ChanServ
08:19  * Nexxy magic
08:19 <@konobi> heh
08:19 < gladoscc> heh
08:19 < gladoscc> play kick roulette!
08:19 <@Nexxy> no!
08:20 < SomeoneWeird> loll
08:20 <@konobi> i do not get mad very often... so this is prolly a once in a lifetime experience
08:20 < SomeoneWeird> its ryah !
08:21 < SomeoneWeird> so i'm bored, anybody got any ideas for modules they need? :p
08:21 < gkatsev> SomeoneWeird: substack already got it all covered.
08:21 < SomeoneWeird> lmao
08:21 < gkatsev> :P
08:21 < freewil> subtack + visionmedia
08:21 <@Nexxy> why is SF so loud?
08:22 < gkatsev> hipsters
08:22 < Daegalus> lots of people
08:22 < Daegalus> and cars
08:22 < freewil> free love in the streets man
08:22 < Daegalus> and hipsters
08:22 < gkatsev> lots of hipsters
08:23 < Daegalus> Nexxy: go to the Piers if you havent been yet
08:23 < SomeoneWeird> serious though i need an idea for something >___>
08:23 <@Nexxy> I'm not going anywhere!
08:24 < Daegalus> Nexxy: why?!
08:24 < SomeoneWeird> because why not
08:24 < Daegalus> SomeoneWeird: program a centipede-eating firefly that zooms around, and deletes poorly secured websites
08:25 < SomeoneWeird> pay for the hardware and i'll do it
08:25 < SomeoneWeird> ^.^
08:26 <@Nexxy> Daegalus, I'm doing hard hack!
08:26 < Daegalus> what hardware, utilize free servers, and such. should be able to pull off something if you combine a bunch of Azure, Google App Engine, and AWS Free
08:27 < SomeoneWeird> wat
08:27 < SomeoneWeird> firefly
08:27 < Daegalus> Nexxy: sounds fun. too bad im too busy to mess around with my Raspberry pi, got breakout boards, wires, LCDs, thermistors, and other stuff to combine
08:27 < Daegalus> SomeoneWeird: exactly
08:28 < SomeoneWeird> can i have an rPI
08:28 < SomeoneWeird> :
08:28 < SomeoneWeird> :c
08:28 < Daegalus> shouldnt be too hard to get one, I ordered mine and got it in a week
08:28 < gladoscc> Holy crap.
08:28 < gladoscc> I just fixed the bug that I've being trying to fix for practically the entire day :D
08:28 <@Nexxy> Daegalus, it's 1 weekend
08:29 < SomeoneWeird> nice gladoscc 
08:29 < SomeoneWeird> Daegalus, meh i don't have the mony lol
08:29 < SomeoneWeird> money(
08:29 < SomeoneWeird> **
08:29 < Daegalus> Nexxy: nerdgasmic geekgasms?
08:29 <@Nexxy> "too busy to"...
08:29 <@Nexxy> > chatting on IR
08:29 <@Nexxy> C
08:30 < Daegalus> chatting on IRC while in bed and about to pass out
08:30 <@Nexxy> oh hey me too
08:30 <@Nexxy> nanight
08:30 < Daegalus> ngiht
08:33 < gladoscc> I'm kinda peeved with how they double the ram in rasp pi.
08:33 < gladoscc> people who got the first batches won't get much support when software starts assuming everyone has 512mb
08:36 < No9> Anyone know of a Relay type service where you can register your things and talk to them over the interwebs like DDNS but without the DNS
08:36 < gladoscc> No9: irc?
08:36 < No9> Think IRC for hardware
08:37 < gladoscc> No9: Is there any reason why you don't want to use DNS?
08:38 < gladoscc> I'm not sure about what you're trying to do, but maybe tor onion sites?
08:38 < SomeoneWeird> cjdns
08:39 < No9> Got some hardware that I want to make accessible over the internet 
08:39 < SomeoneWeird> so plug it into the internet
08:39 < SomeoneWeird> >__>
08:39 < gladoscc> lol yeah.
08:40 < hitsthings> No9 might mean something high level like ninja blocks? http://new.ninjablocks.com/
08:40 < No9> Just want to make it discoverable 
08:40 < gladoscc> Alternatively, build your own implemention of TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP!
08:40 < gladoscc> No9: then plug it into the internet
08:40 < SomeoneWeird> and you can't plug it into the internet, why?
08:40 < No9> wow gladoscc your so helpful I want to die 
08:40 < lethalduck> WCF has discovery
08:41 < No9> hitsthings: Thats the sort of stuff I am looking for thanks 
08:42 < gladoscc> Yes, and WCF discovery requires you to be connected to a network.
08:42 < lethalduck> Ah, No9's not on the network. Bugger
08:43 < lethalduck> Sounds very tricky then.
08:43 < gladoscc> No9: perhaps ethernet will do?
08:43 < SomeoneWeird> still hasn't answered why he can't connect to the internet
08:44 < SomeoneWeird> or a network
08:44 < Cronoh> hi im using socket.io and the rooms feature, moving someone to a room when they connect, for some reason on firefox my client is connecting twice, it connects (Send join message and then discconect), then reconnects again! doesnt happen in chrome, any ideas?
08:48 < gladoscc> Cronoh: yes
08:48 < gladoscc> Probably favicon.ico.
08:49 < Cronoh> what?
08:49 < gladoscc> when a browser visits a page, they tend to make a request for favicon.ico too.
08:49 < SomeoneWeird> ya
08:49 < No9> SomeoneWeird I can connect to a network gladoscc summed it up best I am looking for IRC but for hardware 
08:49 < gladoscc> If your node.js is trained to serve socket.io for everything, that'd be the problem.
08:49 < SomeoneWeird> but you can't connect to the internet?
08:49 < gladoscc> No9: What hardware?
08:50 < gladoscc> Are they in the same room, etc?
08:50 < No9> Nope they are on different continents 
08:50 < gladoscc> Okay.,
08:50 < SomeoneWeird> x.X
08:50 < dawra> any idea how i can get my postgres table's create query ? not a node question but a postgres one :P
08:50 < SomeoneWeird> is another computer on the network connected to the internet?
08:50 < Cronoh> gladoscc: What should i do to ignore the request for favico? :)
08:51 < gladoscc> Cronoh: Only serve your code if the request is just / - check pathnames, etc :)
08:51 < gladoscc> Try pastebinning code.
08:52 < No9> So lets say I have a device that can connect to the web but it has a Dynamic IP allocated I want a place where that IP can be mapped and the services the device provides should be available too 
08:52 < gladoscc> oh, that's simple.
08:52 < gladoscc> Get a AWS or appspot box. Create your own system for recording IP addresses.
08:52 < freewil> or just use something like dyndns.org
08:53 < gladoscc> yeah, lots of ways to do this.
08:53 < gladoscc> now you could have said the last line as your first question.
08:53 < No9> gladoscc Apologies I did sort of ask for the smart answers alright  
08:54 < No9> I thought that I would have to put something together but I wondered if anyone had heard of an implementation of it 
08:55 < gladoscc> No9: it shouldn't be too difficult.
08:55 < Cronoh> gladoscc: Can you nudge me in the right direction for reasing/parsing the url that the connection comes in on? im not sure if its a nodejs or socket io function im looking for
08:55 < Cronoh> reading*
08:55 < gladoscc> Cronoh: var pathname = url.parse(request.url).pathname;
08:55 < gladoscc> get the url module, obviously!
08:56 < gildean> No9: yeah, you could use a server with static ip to proxy subdomains per name to a dynamic ip
08:56 < gildean> that gets refreshed when the target connects towards the server, for example when the ip changes or the location changes
08:56 < gildean> and if the target is not online, server a placeholder or something
08:57 < SomeoneWeird> s/er/e/
08:57 < SomeoneWeird> :3
08:58 < No9> gildean thanks that sounds like a plan
09:00 < lethalduck> Ninja Blocks looks interesting
09:00 < staar2> hello
09:01 < staar2> what mongodb layer, wrapper to use ?
09:01 < gildean> i've used mongojs
09:02 < gildean> seems to work ok
09:04 <@konobi> thinkgeek tentacle and rule 34... in 3, 2, 1...
09:04 < gladoscc> SomeoneWeird: if you're still bored
09:04 < gladoscc> code a bitcoin module for node.js
09:04 < SomeoneWeird> i am
09:04 < SomeoneWeird> lol
09:05 < SomeoneWeird> lol
09:05 <@konobi> been done
09:05 < gladoscc> I'll even donate (in btc) if you make a bitcoin module :)
09:05 < SomeoneWeird> there a quite a few actually
09:05 < SomeoneWeird> i have enough btc already 
09:05 < SomeoneWeird> :p
09:05 < gladoscc> oh wow
09:06 < SomeoneWeird> ?
09:06 < gladoscc> didn' trealize that
09:06 < gildean> konobi: yeah, the tentacle was cool, the hub of cthulhu made me smirk
09:07 < gladoscc> time to make the next satoshidice
09:07 < gladoscc> and reap in tons of coins
09:07 < SomeoneWeird> make a satoshidice that doesn't murder the chain and i'll let you live
09:08 <@konobi> bitcoin is useless
09:08 < gladoscc> konobi: http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/12/bitcoin-going-mainstream-exchange-approved-to-operate-as-a-bank/
09:08 <@konobi> gladoscc: so?
09:08 < SomeoneWeird> gladoscc, lol thats so fake
09:08 <@konobi> look at the zimbabwean dollar
09:09 < gladoscc> and?
09:09 < gladoscc> Bitcoin has it's uses. It's not widely adopted yet, and it's never going to replace a nation's currency, but there will always be uses.
09:09 <@konobi> no
09:09 < SomeoneWeird> yes
09:09 <@konobi> distributed currency yes... bitcoin no
09:09 < gladoscc> konobi: what's the problem with bitcoin?
09:09 <@konobi> a bitcoin has no inherent value
09:10 <@konobi> other than perceived
09:10 < SomeoneWeird> exactly
09:10 < SomeoneWeird> and?
09:10 < SomeoneWeird> how can a distributed currency be backed by something?
09:10 < gladoscc> konobi: gold has no inherent value, other than perceived
09:10 <@konobi> change bitcoins to be based on something like finding folded proteins...
09:10 < SomeoneWeird> ^^
09:10 < SomeoneWeird> it is..
09:11 <@konobi> gold has inherent value as a material in materials science
09:11 <@konobi> inert, good conductor of both heat and electricity
09:11 < gildean> konobi: how is that different from any money currently used?
09:12 < freewil> bitcoin can't be censored, it can be moved easily and cheaply and it's supply is limited
09:12 < freewil> it has it's uses
09:12 < SomeoneWeird> should probably move his convo to bitcoin chan
09:12 < gladoscc> yeah freewil 
09:12 < gladoscc> There are problems with bitcoin, but it has it's uses.
09:12 <@konobi> freewil: yeah... no inflation either, so it'll die its own death
09:13 < freewil> konobi, bitcoin actually has a predictable inflation over a 40 year period built into the protocol
09:13 < SomeoneWeird> lmao
09:13 < freewil> and not having inflation does not mean death - that is an economic myth
09:13 < SomeoneWeird> no offense but obviously you have no idea how bitcoin works konobi 
09:13 < gladoscc> Also, inflation is essentially a hidden tax.
09:14 < gladoscc> but I don't think this is #economics :P
09:15 < SomeoneWeird> ya
09:16 < gildean> don't be anal about a little bit of offtopic, no offtopic at all makes a boring channel
09:16 < SomeoneWeird> heh
09:18 < gladoscc> lol
09:20 < gladoscc> oh wow
09:20 < gladoscc> I saw one of the new iMacs
09:20 < gladoscc> at the edge, and it looked impossibly thin
09:20 < gladoscc> then after looking it at another angle I realized it's just /really/ curved :/
09:22 < freewil> so im hiring a UK-based graphics designer for $500
09:22 < freewil> and he wants me to do a international wire transfer instead of accepting bitcoin
09:22 < freewil> so it's going to cost me $50
09:22 < freewil> just one example
09:22 < hitsthings> Anybody know of a node module for 3D mapping based on a stream of images?
09:23 < SomeoneWeird> yarp
09:24 < gladoscc> freewil: that sucks. Doesn't accept paypal?
09:25 < freewil> that is a possibility
09:25 < freewil> i dont have it setup myself right now
09:25 < freewil> i cant think of any other options besides paypal, bitcoin, bank wire
09:26 < gladoscc> how do you guys make use of wasted screen space on a 1080p computer?
09:26 < SomeoneWeird> irc
09:30 < Cronoh> i cant figure out how im supposed to block all requests that arent on a certain path using socket io/express, can anyone help me please?
09:31 < gladoscc> Cronoh: yes
09:31 < gladoscc> Please pastebin your code.
09:31 < Cronoh> ok
09:32 < Cronoh> http://pastebin.com/PDgx3iKw
09:32 < gildean> app.use(function (req, res) { res.send(418, 'sorry bro, no coffee'); });
09:33 < Cronoh> ahh .use
09:33 < Cronoh> ok one minute
09:38 < Cronoh> hmm this doesnt seem to be catching anything ? =/ http://pastebin.com/MwhbYpTs
09:38 < Cronoh> console never gets hit
09:39 < SomeoneWeird> Cronoh, http://pastebin.com/vsR3qzde
09:39 < gildean> Cronoh: with app.use don't put the path there
09:39 < gildean> just app.use(function....
09:39 < Cronoh> ah yes my mistake thank you
09:40 < gildean> also there's no need to check the path as in SomeoneWeirds suggestion, you can just handle all reqs 
09:41 < SomeoneWeird> i just copied his code and added the next
09:41 < SomeoneWeird> :p
09:42 < gildean> i wouldn't use it as a middleware, but a "catch-all" function that grabs all reqs not handled by the routes or the static
09:43 < Cronoh> well it still never makes it to the console line for some reason though =/
09:44 < SomeoneWeird> is it before all routes?
09:45 < Cronoh> http://pastebin.com/vDfHahuU
09:45 < Cronoh> that is basically my whole nodejs server
09:45 < Cronoh> i have 2-3 bigger functions i cut out with the comment to save room
09:46 < Cronoh> please let me know what i am doing wrong i am new and trying to learn :)
09:48 < gildean> Cronoh: on the first line, you're ending the var statement with a ; instead of ,
09:49 < Cronoh> oh jesus sorry
09:50 < Cronoh> for some reason that didnt seem to effect ti believe it or not lol, though i did fix it
09:50 < gladoscc> ping
09:50 < Cronoh> pong
09:51 < gladoscc> I should write an irc bot sometime.
09:51 < gildean> Cronoh: also the catch-all needs to be below the routes
09:51 < gladoscc> Good node.js irc module?
09:51 < SomeoneWeird> 'irc'
09:52 < hitsthings> Does require('http').createServer(app) actually work? I would expect it's ignoring the app altogether
09:53 < SomeoneWeird> no it works
09:53 < hitsthings> til
09:53 < Cronoh> im sorry i really am tryignt my best to figure it out i have been up a long time , but here is my full unedited server file, it isnt even echoing to the console in the app.use for some reason =/ http://pastebin.com/fJqWJ21p
09:53 < gildean> hitsthings: yeah, most of the time you can just chain the command you're going to use from the required module
09:54 < SomeoneWeird> he means the createServer(app) part
09:54 < SomeoneWeird> put app.use before the .listen statement Cronoh 
09:54 < hitsthings> yeah the API says it takes in a funnction - didn't realize express apps are functions
09:55 < Cronoh> SomeoneWeird: Still nothing :'( Am I doing something wrong?!
09:59 < gildean> Cronoh: well, this shouldn't be related, but imo you shouldn't create a connection to the database on each new connection from a client
09:59 < gildean> but create the connection beforehand and just reuse the same connection
10:00 < Cronoh> yea probably a good idea, thanks for the input will do it for sure
10:02 < Cronoh> im thinking it has something to do with socket io like im supposed to be listening to reqest on one of those objects or something, but i dont know
10:02 < Cronoh> doesnt make sense that app.use console isnt ever coming up
10:02 < gladoscc> my advice is to start simple, just node http + socket.io
10:02 < Cronoh> because the console lines for verified come up multiple times
10:02 < gildean> also, if you strip away all the socket.io parts and replace it with just an express route, it works as supposed to
10:03 < Cronoh> so it is an intereferance with socket.io?
10:04 < gildean> perhaps, idk
10:04 < gildean> never used socket.io, maybe i should try it out
10:04 < gildean> for some reason i've only used either ws or websocket modules
10:05 < gildean> maybe because for the small apps i've made, there hasn't been need for fallbacks
10:05 < Cronoh> i jsut read that using socket io would be faster so i used it, im a noob i dont know any better :o
10:05 < gladoscc> socket.io is cool if you need websockets
10:05 < gladoscc> don't try to build, say, a blog or a forum out of socket.io unless you want it to be AJAXy
10:06 < gildean> well it has a lot of internal magic afaik, so it's prolly easier for most things
10:06 < Cronoh> wella s you can see this is a chat
10:07 < Cronoh> i have the rest of my site dont in php/symfony2
10:07 < Cronoh> jsut using ndoe for the chat server wanted to learn it
10:07 < Cronoh> done in * sorry my typing is horrible
10:26 < dileep> hey everytime when i testt ma code i have to change the port coz when i run ma code using the same port it shows me error of Error:Listen  EADDRIN USE...how can i safe myself from tthat...
10:27 < dileep> anybody here to help me
10:30 < mmalecki> dileep: kill the previous server
10:34 < deoxxa> lol
10:35 < yawnt> deoxxa: STOP LAUGHING AT ME FOR CLOSING MYSELF OUT OF MY FLAT
10:35 < deoxxa> yawnt: lol you suck
10:35 < yawnt> :(
10:36 < deoxxa> how'd you do that
10:36 < yawnt> so i was watching a tv show right?
10:36 < deoxxa> right
10:36 < yawnt> girl knocks at my door.. asks "wanna cook pizza?"
10:36 < deoxxa> slow down, this is a lie
10:36 < yawnt> nope
10:36 < yawnt> i'm like "sure, why not"
10:36 < deoxxa> do you, playah, do you
10:36 < yawnt> we start cooking.. then she asks "oh i forgot the salt"
10:37 < yawnt> since i live next door to the kitchen i insert the card (we have rfid chips)
10:37 < yawnt> open the oor
10:37 < yawnt> *door
10:37 < yawnt> but it's dark because you need the rfid in place (like hotels room) to power up electricity
10:37 < yawnt> i grab the salt, close the door
10:37 < yawnt> "f**k"
10:37 < SomeoneWeird> lmao
10:38 < deoxxa> gg
10:38 < yawnt> the next one that laughs is dying
10:38 < deoxxa> "WELL, LOOKS LIKE I'LL HAVE TO STAY WITH YOU"
10:38 < yawnt> lol
10:38 < yawnt> there were two girls tbh
10:38 < deoxxa> please tell me you did that
10:38 < deoxxa> if you didn't
10:38 < deoxxa> jeez
10:38 < yawnt> a friend of her came by
10:38 < SomeoneWeird> OH YOU ONLY HAVE ONE BED?
10:38 < yawnt> she does indeed
10:38 < yawnt> but the other girl was sleeping with her cause she was on vacation or something
10:38 < yawnt> no room for me apparently :\
10:39 < SomeoneWeird> awww
10:39 < SomeoneWeird> lmao
10:39 < yawnt> so i had to call the janitor 
10:39 < deoxxa> yawnt: there's an expression - when life gives you lemons, HOOK IN BRO
10:39 < yawnt> who, with his best killer voice, said "i'll be there in 30 minutes, i'm busy now"
10:39 < deoxxa> lol
10:40 < yawnt> and he opened the door of mah flat.. *happy end*
10:40 < SomeoneWeird> did you get the girl?
10:40 < SomeoneWeird> lol
10:40 < SomeoneWeird> else not happy end
10:40 < yawnt> yeah that was the point
10:40 < yawnt> ;_;//
10:40 < deoxxa> "ima... ima ha muri. machinasai. sanjuppun ato kuru."
10:41 < yawnt> i met a girl from Taiwan deoxxa 
10:41 < deoxxa> did he have blood on his shirt
10:41 < yawnt> protip:
10:41 < yawnt> never ever
10:41 < deoxxa> oh dear
10:41 < yawnt> call people from Taiwan chinese
10:41 < yawnt> :\
10:41 < deoxxa> yeahhhhh
10:41 < yawnt> i did that mistake
10:41 < yawnt> .. once
10:41 < mpfundstein> what did they do? cut your ear off :-)?
10:41 < yawnt> no one survived, NOT EVEN YAWNT (for whoever watches The Simpsons)
10:41 < deoxxa> haha, i like dave chappelle's take on that though
10:41 < deoxxa> "DO I LOOK CHINESE TO YOU?"
10:42 < deoxxa> "yes motherfucker you do look chinese! that's why i said it! it was a mistake!"
10:42 < mpfundstein> ^^
10:42 < yawnt> Willie: "One day the mine collapsed, no-one survived, not even willie"
10:42 < yawnt> ^ quote from The Simpsons
10:42 < yawnt> anyway
10:42 < deoxxa> damn scots
10:42 < deoxxa> they're ruining scotland
10:42 < yawnt> they ruined scotland
10:42 < yawnt> o/
10:42 < deoxxa> oh ruined
10:42 < deoxxa> i fail
10:42 < yawnt> yeah

10:44 < yawnt> i just imagined a running skull passing by
10:44 < yawnt> deoxxa: btw i decided.. i wanna move to NZ
10:45 < deoxxa> sounds like FUN
10:45 < yawnt> deoxxa: its fairly near japan
10:45 < deoxxa> except for the part where .nz is like a smaller version of .au from 10 years ago
10:45 < yawnt> like... nearer than i am nw
10:45 < yawnt> *now
10:46 < yawnt> deoxxa: yeah except the fact that your own damn toilet hasn't poisoned teeth and tries to bite you
10:46 < deoxxa> hey, *my* toilet doesn't have that
10:46 < yawnt> welcome to australia
10:46 < deoxxa> just *most* toilets
10:46 < deoxxa> but i live in the city
10:46 < yawnt> the place where even trees can squash you like a tennis ball
10:46 < deoxxa> it's so convenient having the administrator of my japanese school on facebook
10:47 < yawnt> lol
10:47 < deoxxa> "hey are there classes next week"
10:47 < deoxxa> "yeah"
10:47 < yawnt> "HOW DO YOU SAY <X>"

10:47 < deoxxa> "...yes"
10:47 < deoxxa> "oh ok"
10:47 < mmalecki> OMG DEOXXA
10:47 < yawnt> deoxxa: you're not
10:47 < yawnt> you're going to Senegal
10:47 < yawnt> i know someone willing to travel with ya
10:47 < deoxxa> awwwww shit
10:47 < deoxxa> fuck senegal
10:47 < mmalecki> deoxxa: nope.
10:47 < deoxxa> i don't want to fly that far again
10:47 < mmalecki> senegal is awesome.
10:47 < yawnt> lol
10:47 < mmalecki> they have a pink lake
10:47 < deoxxa> lol
10:48 < mmalecki> SRSLY
10:48 < mmalecki> I'm going there in January
10:48 < yawnt> mmalecki: take the water
10:48 < yawnt> bring it back to poland
10:48 < deoxxa> i'll be in GLORIOUS DAI-NIPPON at that point
10:48 < yawnt> deoxxa: THE EMPIRE OF THE RISING SUN
10:48 < mmalecki> Japan you say?
10:48 < gildean> i'm pretty sure that lake is all the water senegal has
10:48 < yawnt> ALL HAIL BRITANNIA
10:48 < deoxxa> mmalecki: sou desu
10:48 < gildean> iirc draught is a serious problem there, and the lack of clean water
10:49 < yawnt> gildean: yeah i know people from there
10:49 < yawnt> who emigrated here
10:49 < yawnt> they have to make up to 40 km to get some (dirty) water
10:49 < deoxxa> sux2bthem
10:49 < yawnt> 2b||!2b
10:49 < deoxxa> i turn on a tap and it comes out
10:49 < deoxxa> first world country, awwww yeah
10:50 < yawnt> lol
10:50 < yawnt> fuck you, you should be grateful
10:50 < deoxxa> lol, i am
10:50 < deoxxa> i just don't feel guilty about it when people say "well this place has it worse"
10:50 < gildean> "what, i'm out of coke and have to drink water wtf."
10:50 < deoxxa> it's like "ok?"
10:50 < gildean> first world problems
10:50 < deoxxa> good point
10:50 < deoxxa> i should get pizza + coke in a minute
10:51 < mmalecki> I mean, hotels have water, don't they?
10:51 < deoxxa> theoretically
10:51 < mmalecki> ...wat.
10:51 < mmalecki> okay, I'll call and ask first
10:51 < gildean> i'm pretty sure you'll find water anywhere, if you drill deep enough
10:51 < deoxxa> gildean: or lava, which is arguably -way- more fun
10:51 < mmalecki> "hey, I want to make an reservation. however, do you guys have water?"
10:51 < yawnt> mmalecki: they have snakes
10:51 < yawnt> and spiders
10:52 < yawnt> mmalecki: good luck in finding a hotel
10:52 < gildean> deoxxa: it's like hot water, right?
10:52 < gildean> except made of stone
10:52 < mmalecki> yawnt: in Dakar there's shitloads of them
10:52 < yawnt> deoxxa: do some lava surf
10:52 < mmalecki> so don't you worry child
10:52 < deoxxa> awwww yeah
10:52 < yawnt> lol
10:52 < deoxxa> that sounds like a real ROCKING time
10:52 < deoxxa> get it
10:52 < yawnt> i can see mmalecki in a couple of months
10:52 < yawnt> "i made friends here"
10:53 < yawnt> comes home with a shitload of diamonds
10:53 < deoxxa> "they just need help moving some money out of the country"
10:53 < deoxxa> "can they use your bank account plx"
10:53 < yawnt> yeah exactly
10:53 < deoxxa> "no seriously his dad's a prince"
10:53 < yawnt> diamonds are better
10:53 < mmalecki> hahahaha
10:53 < yawnt> you can't trace them
10:53 < yawnt> if they weren't marked
10:53 < mmalecki> yup
10:54 < deoxxa> bitcoin is the future
10:54 < yawnt> lol
10:54 < deoxxa> mmalecki: eta on nodejitsu doing bitcoin
10:54 < deoxxa> come onnnnnn
10:54 < yawnt> i never figured out why bitcoin should be of any good
10:54 < yawnt> i don't really trust virtual currency anyway
10:54 < deoxxa> yes because the lima was so great
10:55 < yawnt> I KEEP ALL MY SAVINGS IN MY MATTRESS yo
10:55 < deoxxa> (that was the .it currency before the euro, right?)
10:55 < yawnt> deoxxa: lira
10:55 < deoxxa> lira
10:55 < deoxxa> that's it
10:55 < deoxxa> close enough
10:55 < yawnt> we still have the key in the keyboard
10:55 < deoxxa> physical bad, virtual good!
10:55 < yawnt> even thought it was taken out in 2002
10:55 < yawnt> £
10:55 < yawnt> oh good ol' lira
10:55 < deoxxa> that's for the pound, isn't it?
10:55 < yawnt> no
10:55 < yawnt> it's also the lira
10:55 < deoxxa> oh

10:57 < mmalecki> iksik2: not that I know of, there were some in Poznan but I don't think that's the case anymore
10:58 < iksik2> uhm
10:58 < yawnt> but we can go all at mmalecki's house, get drunk and pretend we're having a node meeting
10:58 < yawnt> \o/
10:58 < iksik2> ;-DDD
10:58 < mmalecki> iksik2: https://www.facebook.com/meetjspl is a good place to look for them tho
10:58 < mmalecki> but also, I approve the idea
10:58 < deoxxa> mmalecki: how do you pronounce your last name
10:58 < mmalecki> sorry, no flight reimbursements for speakers tho

10:59 < deoxxa> that's not your last name!
11:00 < deoxxa> gonna open an issue
11:00 < deoxxa> this is a defect
11:00 < yawnt> lol
11:00 < mmalecki> this is both my first and last name XD
11:00 < mmalecki> but yeah
11:00 < yawnt> UNACCEPTABLE

11:04 < staar2> is there any articles about creating thin database layer on nativev mongodb ?
11:07 < prishabh> you may want to submit that repo to hackernews, I'll upvote
11:13 < mmalecki> deoxxa: commented
11:14 < mmalecki> maintaining open source projects is complicated

12:11 < mpfundstein> who *
12:13 < mpfundstein> is anyone here interested in a nodeJS cloud-crowd solution ?
12:15 < deoxxa> mpfundstein: i'm interested in an explanation of what exactly the hell that would be
12:16 < mpfundstein> it is a distributed job system
12:16 < mpfundstein> you have a big mama (thats how i call it) who you can POST jobs too
12:16 < mpfundstein> she distributes it to their children
12:16 < mpfundstein> they execute the jobs like for instance transcode a video 
12:17 < deoxxa> ahh, i see
12:17 < deoxxa> and you bill based on processing time or something?
12:17 < mpfundstein> AH NOOO
12:17 < mpfundstein> open source
12:17 < mpfundstein> :D
12:17 < mpfundstein> https://github.com/MarkusXite/Big-Mama---Distributed-Job-System
12:17 < deoxxa> well those cpu cycles have to come from somewhere
12:18 < deoxxa> and it's not going to be "the kindness of the human spirit"
12:18 < mpfundstein> i actually use it on my own servers
12:18 < mpfundstein> couple of VM's
12:18 < SomeoneWeird> if its free why not
12:18 < mpfundstein> it is just code, no implementation
12:18 < mpfundstein> i use it to transcode videos
12:18 < mpfundstein> very efficiently but it is still in baby shoes
12:19 < mpfundstein> just wanted to ask if someone wuld be interested in sm.th. like this :-)
12:19 < SomeoneWeird> i would
12:20 < mpfundstein> https://github.com/MarkusXite/Big-Mama---Distributed-Job-System thats the link
12:20 < mpfundstein> i dont have documentation yet

12:57 < prologic> Hey all
12:57 < prologic> Does anyone possible know the developer of the Groove Basin web frontend for mpd?
12:57 < SomeoneWeird> wat
12:57 < prologic> Or might help me with getting it up and running
12:58 < SomeoneWeird> what is it?
12:59 < prologic> groovebasin: https://github.com/superjoe30/groovebasin
12:59 < prologic> Paste of the trouble I'm having starting it up: http://codepad.org/5LfHYr2g
12:59 < prologic> I don't have much experience with nodejs myself really (yet)
13:00 < SomeoneWeird> https://github.com/superjoe30
13:00 < SomeoneWeird> him
13:00 < SomeoneWeird> lol
13:01 < prologic> haha yeah ofc
13:01 < prologic> I wonder if he lurks around freenode though
13:01 < SomeoneWeird> not sure, looks like you're missing a file or something
13:02 < prologic> yeah but what?
13:02 < prologic> the log doesn't seem to say specifically what
13:02  * prologic looks again closely
13:03 < SomeoneWeird> "unable to connect to ipc-file `naught.ipc`"
13:04 < prologic> hmm
13:05 < prologic> hmmm
13:06 < prologic> that file was created by another run which sort of half worked
13:06 < prologic> removing it starts it up again
13:06 < prologic> but I'm getting this continiously ont he CLI
13:07 < prologic> WorkerDeath. booting: 1, online: 0, dying: 0, new_booting: 0, new_online: 0
13:14 < prologic> hmm
13:14 < prologic> I think I might have gotten it working
13:14 < prologic> :)
13:55 < letsstartwedding> hello..if someone want to chat! http://letsplanmywedding.com/forums/
13:56 < Sly> Because spamming a room full of programmers is definitely the way to get people to chat about weddings.
13:56 < letsstartwedding> you mean no one interested?
13:56  * Sly isn't.
13:56 < Sly> I don't plan on getting married.
13:56 < zomg> Weddings!
13:56 < zomg> How lovely
13:56 < RLa> well, we have over 800 people, there is chance someone is planning wedding here
13:56 < zomg> Babbies that scream and poop their diapers
13:56 < zomg> Also lovely
13:57 < letsstartwedding> hehe yes maybe!
13:57 < Sly> RLa: maybe I would care if it was built in Node, but yeah.
13:58 < zomg> Whoever hired this guy to advertise that forum
13:58 < zomg> did a good job
13:58 < Sly> Haven't seen a complete forum built in Node yet.
13:58 < zomg> lol
13:58 < zomg> He's also on #haskell
13:58 < letsstartwedding> :)
13:58 < zomg> I guess programming channels are the biggest ones on freenode
13:59 < letsstartwedding> i have check and in this chanel are more people then in other!
13:59 < letsstartwedding> congrulations!
13:59 < Sly> I wish deoxxa were here right now.
13:59 < RLa> is he planning wedding?
13:59 < RLa> haha
13:59 < spion> lol
13:59 < Sly> Or niggler.
14:00 < letsstartwedding> ok i understand no one are interested :(
14:01 < zomg> letsstartwedding: yeah you might actually want to research where people who actually are interested in weddings hang out and go there rather than randomly spamming
14:01 < zomg> :p
14:01 < Sly> letsstartwedding: Most of the people that come in here aren't even graduated from high school yet.. more-less worried about marriage.
14:01 < zomg> (Hint: It's not IRC)
14:02 < letsstartwedding> yes but i forgot how to use irc
14:02 < letsstartwedding> as i have used it maybe 3 years ago
14:02 < letsstartwedding> :))
14:07 < letsstartwedding> no one here?
14:10 < spion> hey, us old people hang out here too
14:17 < Sly> spion: lol. I know some people hang out here that aren't in school.. I'm one of them.
14:18 < Sly> But yeah, there's a lot here that shouldn't even think about weddings for a few years. xD
14:44 < letsstartwedding> goodbye my friends!
14:51 < chakrit> need help w/ gyp, getting ld errors on compiled module. anyone?
14:52 < chakrit> code is on https://github.com/chakrit/node-icu-wordsplit and the error output is over https://gist.github.com/4240521
14:52 < chakrit> (scroll down to lazy symbol binding failed...)
14:59 < bnoordhuis> chakrit: so what do icu-config --cppflags and icu-config --ldflags print?
15:00 < bnoordhuis> chakrit: also, is that the error you get when linking or when loading the module in node?
15:02 < chakrit> bnoordhuis: on load
15:03 < chakrit> bnoordhuis: updated the gist https://gist.github.com/4240521 with cppflags and ldflags output
15:03 < bnoordhuis> chakrit: does the symbol exist in wordsplit.node? check with otool
15:04 < bnoordhuis> i ask because i suspect that it is but it's not visible to the outside world (i.e. node)
15:04 < chakrit> ah.. checking.
15:05 < bnoordhuis> chakrit: or is that a symbol from libicu itself?
15:06 < chakrit> yes it should be from icu
15:07 < chakrit> sorry if i'm a little dumb with these things haha. never got this deep into linker land before.
15:07 < bnoordhuis> chakrit: where is libicu installed? it could be that it's not in a default linker path
15:08 < bnoordhuis> i mean the dynamic linker's search path
15:08 < bnoordhuis> i'm guessing /usr/local/Cellar/icu4c/50.1/lib?
15:09 < bnoordhuis> what happens if you `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/icu4c/50.1/lib`?
15:09 < chakrit> I have icu*.dylib files in /usr/local/lib/
15:09 < chakrit> i think it is linked there by homebrew
15:09 < chakrit> from /cellar
15:09 < chakrit> trying that anyway...
15:10 < chakrit> same thing :/
15:11 < bnoordhuis> what does `otool -L wordsplit.node` print?
15:11 < chakrit> https://raw.github.com/gist/4240679/de8e91ecb55a4e5e96051b1277460e9360870e8c/gistfile1.txt
15:12 < bnoordhuis> looks okay to me
15:12 < bnoordhuis> chakrit: i'd check with otool if that symbol exists in one of those libraries
15:12 < chakrit> yeah... been scratching my head for a few hours now. it used to works fine with icu 49
15:12 < chakrit> ok. let me go through that.
15:20 < chakrit> bnoordhuis: ran `otool -tV libicuuc.50.1.dylib` and got lots of mention of UnicodeString
15:20 < chakrit> like __ZN6icu_5013UnicodeStringD1Ev
15:20 < chakrit> but not __ZN6icu_5013UnicodeStringC1EPKti that is printed from the error message
15:21 < chakrit> note the last few characters
15:21 < chakrit> what does that mean?
15:29 < degrio> .
15:31 < bnoordhuis> chakrit: some kind of mismatch. have you done a clean build?
15:31 < bnoordhuis> i.e. `node-gyp rebuild`?
15:31 < chakrit> bnoordhuis: yes, i did.
15:32 < bnoordhuis> chakrit: might be a header/library mismatch
15:32 < bnoordhuis> make sure there are no other icu headers on the compiler's include path
15:33 < chakrit> bnoordhuis: ah... that could be the problem. trying...
15:37 < rk8888> hello everyone
15:37 < chakrit> hi
15:38 < jamesd> where is that deadbeat everyone he stole our beer money... and were running low. 
15:39 < rk8888> I am looking for someone willing to teach me, in the form of private lessons, about node.
15:42 < Kakera> rk8888, why can't you learn yourself?
15:50 < FunnyLookinHat> rk8888, Start here to learn javascript: http://www.codecademy.com/
15:50 < FunnyLookinHat> Then just start reading tutorials and example code.  :)
15:50 < FunnyLookinHat> Until you've got a good handle on how JS works though, I wouldn't start trying to write in Node.
16:00 < sush_> hello
16:04 < sush_> ?
16:04 < chakrit> hi
16:04 < gildean> evening
16:05 < sush_> evening
16:37 < ehershey> hi
16:38 < ehershey> will a repeated call to require() reload a module if the files hav ebeen updated?
16:38 < ehershey> er, have been
16:38 < ehershey> or is there a different/better way to allow updating a module without restarting the node process?
16:39 < jscoder> Hey guys, can someone help me with this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13779395/how-do-i-test-my-node-package-locally
16:39 < ehershey> I am going to test my hypothesis
16:39 < ehershey> I just realized how easily I can do it
16:42 < deoxxa> Sly: I'M HERE NOW :<
16:43 < deoxxa> not for long though, it's haikyo time
16:43 < ehershey> in fact is there an easier way to test what I'm asking than this? 
16:43  * deoxxa finds torch
16:43 < ehershey> i=1; echo "exports.version = function() { return $i }" > testmodule.js ; node -e 'var f = function() { console.log(require("testmodule").version()) }; setTimeout(f, 1000); setTimeout(f,3000) ' & sleep 2 ; i=`expr $i + 1`; echo "exports.version = function() { return $i }" > testmodule.js
16:43 < ehershey> and my test did not work
16:43 < ehershey> it printed 1 twice
16:49 < hoangelos> has anyone here played around with pouchdb?
16:51 < daleharvey> hoangelos: I have
16:52 < hoangelos> daleharvey: I would bet you have... I'm playing around with it.  And trying to figure out how to access it as a client.
16:52 < hoangelos> I'm at Cornell University and I'm hoping to work on this project for my next semester class
16:53 < daleharvey> ah awesome
16:53 < hoangelos> I've followed the steps and so far Google Chrome tests all pass. Safari tests don't seem to work fo rme.
16:53 < daleharvey> Safari support isnt in yet
16:53 < hoangelos> I'm trying to get a jump start on learning it, with the hope that they'll give me my first choice: yours
16:54 < hoangelos> ok, well that makes sense why the tests didn't all pass.
16:54 < daleharvey> Firefox + Chrome right now, the WebSQL support mostly works but is kinda broken and hasnt been merged yet
16:55 < daleharvey> (https://github.com/daleharvey/pouchdb/issues/63 is the bug)
16:56 < daleharvey> but thats awesome, glad to hear its your first choice :) I am around here or #couchdb if you have any questions
16:56 < hoangelos> ok, so as to the API docs.  So, maybe this is more of a node.js question.  I haven't used node before, but have an unhealthy lack of fear of anything.
16:56 < hoangelos> and I've used JS for a long time
16:57 < hoangelos> but is there a way to run node.js interactively so I can see the output of the API docs examples?
16:57 < daleharvey> yeh, you just type $ node at the shell
16:59 < hoangelos> ok.  I thought that.  it gives me a pouch is not defined when I do that.
17:00 < hoangelos> I assume I have to load the pouch module in somehow.
17:01 < gildean> hoangelos: did you install the pouchdb module?
17:01 < gildean> then just var pouch = require('pouchdb');
17:02 < hoangelos> I must not installed it right
17:02 < daleharvey> yeh thats pretty much what I was typing out :P http://pastie.org/5499075
17:02 < hoangelos> I didn't do it as root is my guess
17:02 < daleharvey> nono, dont do it as root
17:02 < hoangelos> ahh didn't do the npm install pouchdb part.  ok
17:02 < hoangelos> that was the error.  yep that works now.   ty
17:11 < jscoder> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13779395/how-do-i-test-my-node-package-locally Any help? :3
17:11 < hoangelos> daleharvey: thanks for the help, and with any luck I'll get picked for the project.  Either way, like the looks of this project.
17:17 < chris64> hi
17:18 < garbagecollectio> how can i detect if the javascript is on the client or server
17:18 < garbagecollectio> my library
17:18 < garbagecollectio> and do a module.exports or not
17:18 < addisonj> hrm... is there some easy place to see how many sockets an http.Server has? (specially inside express)
17:18 < garbagecollectio> like moment.js has
17:19 < addisonj> garbagecollectio: you can just check for commonjs objects (module.exports, require)
17:19 < chris64> please excuse this generic question but I'm wondering if there is an easy and effortless datastore (possibly as nodejs module) that's able to store js objects on disks and maintain some simple indices?
17:20 < garbagecollectio> addison, u mean i should see if module.exports exists?
17:20 < garbagecollectio> if it does its node if not its client?
17:21 < JohnMcLear> chris64: look at ueberdb
17:21 < JohnMcLear> https://github.com/Pita/ueberDB
17:22 < chris64> JohnMcLear: ah, thank you :)
17:22 < JohnMcLear> DirtyDB is prolly gonna do what you want, it's dirty but good for < 1M records
17:22 < garbagecollectio> addisonj: u mean i should see if module.exports exists?
17:22 < addisonj> garbagecollectio: its less about node vs browser and more of "Do you support commonjs or not?", then your lib would be compatible with browserify and other script loaders on the brwoser, and work in node
17:22 < addisonj> but yes
17:23 < chris64> JohnMcLear: sounds both interesting, I'll read through it, thank you :)
17:23 < garbagecollectio> shit
17:23 < JohnMcLear> pleasure
17:23 < addisonj> garbagecollectio: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6665779/best-practices-for-cross-commonjs-browser-development
17:24 < medikoo> garbagecollectio: just write commonjs modules and pack them for browser with tools like https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake no need for boilerplate
17:25 < addisonj> garbagecollectio: http://caolanmcmahon.com/posts/writing_for_node_and_the_browser/ or this is a bit more up to date
17:25 < garbagecollectio> wtf
17:25 < garbagecollectio> wow nice find thanks addisonj
17:26 < staar2> i got error on everyauth You are trying to access the attribute/method configured by `findUserById`, which you did not configure. Time to configure it.
17:26 < addisonj> np, go forth and code
17:26 < staar2> well i added the findUserById but still same
17:28 < darrenlooby> Hi guys, I'm using fs.watch... and, wondered if there is a way of checking if a given file was being watched... Reason is, that if I try to watch a file more than once, it creates multiple events...
17:34 < ehershey> aha!
17:34 < ehershey> delete require.cache[require.resolve('testmodule')]
17:35 < ehershey> bam !
17:51 < garbagecollectio> how come i cant get a job at a startup as a developer
17:51 < garbagecollectio> its weird
17:51 < garbagecollectio> it hurts
17:56 < ehershey> garbagecollectio: are you entry level? 
17:56 < ehershey> and where are you trying? 
17:56 < ehershey> and what are you doing to try? 
17:56 < garbagecollectio> i have a year of experience
17:56 < garbagecollectio> but im fucking smart
17:57 < garbagecollectio> and know a lot
17:57 < ehershey> a year of node experience? 
17:57 < garbagecollectio> two years of experience really
17:57 < garbagecollectio> nah 
17:57 < ehershey> I am job hunting too
17:57 < garbagecollectio> are u in germany?
17:58 < ehershey> in soviet russia
17:58 < ehershey> germany is in u
17:59 < garbagecollectio> lol
17:59 < garbagecollectio> ehersey whats ur background
18:01 < ehershey> are you in germany? 
18:01 < ehershey> my background is web tiers
18:01 < ehershey> apache, databases, app servers
18:01 < ehershey> and linux
18:01 < garbagecollectio> no im not in germany im in us
18:13 < b1lly> hey
18:13 < garbagecollectio> billllllllyyy
18:13 < mprem> is node.js ok for developing multi-tenant apps, ( hosting many websites in 1 node.js process)?
18:15 < b1lly> sup
18:15 < b1lly> so i installed node
18:16 < b1lly> and now this doc to install meteor is telling me to install meteorite
18:28 < AAA_awright> mprem: It's possible but it's not really out-of-the-box functionality. Usually everyone is segregated in their own process, then you use a gateway to forward the request to the appropriate process
18:38 < mprem> AAA_awright: that would take too much memory to host, the websites are tiny, 500 - 600 page views per month
18:38 < AAA_awright> mprem: Generally Node.js is used for I/O bound applications, of which websites are not
18:39 < sofrit0> Hi, after successfully compiling some bindings I'm working on, using GYP, I get a message telling me a .so is not found, however the .so does exist within build/Release … what going on? I'm new to building bindings
18:39 < ehershey> that's like saying
18:39 < ehershey> Generally, Windows is used by non technical users
18:39 < mprem> AAA_awright: considering node.js for a tiny custom cms
18:39 < AAA_awright> You'd need to design the app to handle the different tenants
18:40 < ehershey> tht's what they're doing
18:40 < mprem> AAA_awright: will be done based on http_host
18:40 < AAA_awright> mprem: What's http_host?
18:41 < iksik2> mprem: small express customization should do the trick
18:41 < jrajav> At 500-600 page views a month with no IO? You'll be fine for quite a few hosts.
18:41 < jrajav> Even without threading
18:42 < mprem> not few, tons  ;-)  hundreds to start with, hopefully thousands
18:42 < jrajav> A few thousand would probably be fine
18:43 < mprem> AAA_awright: new to node.js , so not sure what is http_host equivalent
18:43 < jrajav> Start to get much higher than that, or get one or two popular sites, and you'll start seeing trouble
18:43 < mprem> something like request.host?
18:44 < mprem> jrajav: what kind of trouble?
18:44 < jrajav> Performance trouble
18:44 < jrajav> Isn't that what you're worried about?
18:45 < jrajav> You don't necessarily need a process for each host. It's practically trivial to put a load balancer in front of Node to allow you to run several clone processes
18:45 < jrajav> So that you can just spin up more instances of node when you need to scale
18:45 < mprem> I want to run all websites in 1 node process
18:45 < jrajav> 5000 hosts too much for one process? Well, how about two processes? Bam.
18:46 < jrajav> Why?
18:47 < mprem> did a sample in python/django, finally found, need 1 py/django process for 1 website ( that is simplified version, but that the butshell)
18:47 < jrajav> O.. kay?
18:48 < mprem> py/flask framework can do multi-tenant in 1 process, but I am hoping node.js will give better performance/cost 
18:48 < mprem> jrajav: 1 process for many sites, means less memory
18:48 < mprem> s/butshell/nutshell
18:49 < jrajav> Well, right, but it also means that there's a hard limit on how many requests you can concurrently process
18:49 < jrajav> So as long as you're aware of that and are fine with a slowdown once you reach a certain amount of users...
18:49 < mprem> my problem is not as much about how many request but more about requests from more then 1 website
18:50 < mprem> py/django does not handle request from more then 1 website in 1 process
18:50 < mprem> iksik2: can you give more insight
18:50 < jrajav> Okay, but it sounds like you already have a good idea of how to handle that, by keying off of the host
18:51 < mprem> jrajav: yes, but don't know how node.js handles requests
18:51 < mprem> are there any global vars that might step on each other if there is more then 1 host
18:52 < jrajav> That's up to you. Node doesn't really care about the host.
18:52 < iksik2> mprem: https://npmjs.org/browse/keyword/vhost
18:53 < mprem> as everything is in 1 process, I am concerned if request from different host might over write values ( should not happen, but just trying to confirm here )
18:53 < mprem> iksik2: checking, thx
18:56 < iksik2> mprem: https://github.com/visionmedia/express/blob/master/examples/vhost/index.js - and here, it seems to be almost exactly what You need
19:01 < mprem> iksik2: thx, looking into it... something like that, but dynamic
19:01 < mprem> should be able to adapt that
19:06 < iksik2> mprem: sure ;-)
19:15 < sofrit0> Hi, after successfully compiling some bindings I'm working on, using GYP, I get a message telling me a .so is not found, however the .so does exist within build/Release … what might be going on?
19:16 < mscdex> sofrit0: can you upload your binding.gyp somewhere?
19:17 < sofrit0> https://gist.github.com/ba2d342f7e7fe68e07c1
19:18 < mscdex> what .so is this?
19:18 < garbagecollectio> how do I get access to the computer's actual socket connections
19:19 < sofrit0> Error: video_capture_module.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
19:19 < sofrit0> which exists within build/Release
19:20 < mscdex> where is video_capture_module in your binding.gyp ?
19:22 < sofrit0> mscdex: the truth is i'm new to building bindings, it took me a big effort to get this thing compiled … i don't know much about how to write the binding.gyp properly for my needs :$
19:23 < garbagecollectio> what the hell are .gyp
19:23 < mukesh> I am using connect-mongodb to manage session in one of my project. i am  just curious to know where these session are stored in mongodb. I am not able to see any collection for session
19:24 < sofrit0> mukesh: does not seem to be working then, i always get a sessions collection created
19:25 < mukesh> sofrito: Ya I am getting sessions collection, but it does not contains any data.
19:27 < gildean> mukesh: isn't mongodb-connect abandoned? or do i recall incorrectly?
19:29 < sofrit0> mukesh: this is how i'm using it … https://github.com/santiago/red-artes-visuales/blob/master/server.js#L45
19:29 < sofrit0> but it's true you should not use it
19:29 < sofrit0> why not use cookies?
19:30 < mukesh> sorry if I am doing,I am using IRC channel first time so i dont know how to tag u guys.
19:31 < mukesh> sofrit0: acutlly I want to store session in db that why, Do I have another options
19:31 < sofrit0> no, it's fine
19:31 < sofrit0> i've used it for apps where i have a known limited number of users
19:32 < mukesh> gildean: I think it is abandoned . Could u please advice me what session storage should i use.
19:32 < Cronoh> 10/10 hnnnnnngstep http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddFLhQZ0t_4
19:32 < gildean> mukesh: as the express docs suggest, redis
19:33 < mukesh> sofrit0: Thanx
19:33 < gildean> mukesh: iirc the docs even have an example on how to use a redisstore as the session store
19:33 < mukesh> gildean: Thanx
19:40 < garbagecollectio> how do i open up raw socket in node.js
19:40 < garbagecollectio> for example if i wanted to make a crypto project between node.js instances
19:42 < garbagecollectio> ???
19:46 < generalissimo> garbagecollectio: a tcp socket?
19:46 < garbagecollectio> yeah
19:47 < generalissimo> http://nodejs.org/api/net.html
19:50 < Cronoh> im having a hard time trying to figure out how to hook into the on connect event when using express framework?  I'm trying to deny all requests except on a single url, in every example i find they do this on the .createServer(function(request,result){ // here })  but this is taken over by express framework (I put express() in there instead) can someone pls give a noob some advice?
19:52 < garbagecollectio> http://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html
19:52 < garbagecollectio> what does that do exactly
19:56 < Kakera> garbagecollectio, it does crypto stuff
19:56 < garbagecollectio> i think it does more than that
19:56 < garbagecollectio> i mean 
19:56 < garbagecollectio> what kind of stuff
19:56 < garbagecollectio> does it use ssl
19:57 < Kakera> openssl you mean?
19:57 < garbagecollectio> yeah
19:57 < Kakera> I think it does
19:58 < garbagecollectio> i also dont get how node opens up osckets
19:58 < garbagecollectio> is that all v8 doing tat?
19:58 < Kakera> no, libuv
19:59 < garbagecollectio> how does libuv talk to node.js wrapper
19:59 < garbagecollectio> like how does this eventually get into js form
20:00 < Kakera> dunno, look at the source code
20:00 < Kakera> why do you want to know that?
20:00 < garbagecollectio> im just curious
20:01 < gildean> garbagecollectio: http://nodejs.org/api/addons.html
20:01 < garbagecollectio> libuv's purpose is to abstract platform-dependent code in Node into one place where it can be tested for correctness and performance before bindings to V8 are added. 
20:01 < gildean> garbagecollectio: the source is actually quite readable, you can just look at net.js and see where it leads you
20:02 < Kakera> and https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/src/tcp_wrap.cc
20:02 < zomg> I see irccloud still has good stability
20:03 < garbagecollectio> net.js is small
20:03 < woopwoop> can someone tell how to do the eqiv of this in just node, without express http://pastebin.com/eASz2HKj
20:04 < Kakera> woopwoop, use http module
20:05 < woopwoop> and i can use that to prompt the client to save an image on their end?
20:07 < Kakera> I think the download method is just a wrapper around fs.readFileSync and res.send
20:08 < woopwoop> I see, cuz I can't get it to work, that's why I'm trying to find a straight up node solution
20:09 < Kakera> I think you'll have more trouble with pure node
20:09 < woopwoop> I can't even find any examples of that
20:09 < Kakera> what issues do you have exactly
20:09 < garbagecollectio> l dont understand what 
20:09 < garbagecollectio> Use require('crypto') to access this module.
20:09 < garbagecollectio> The crypto module requires OpenSSL to be available on the underlying platform. It offers a way of encapsulating secure credentials to be used as part of a secure HTTPS net or http connection.
20:10 < garbagecollectio> what does this do
20:10 < woopwoop> with the express code, it seems that it works because I see in the browser console the binary of the jpg
20:10 < woopwoop> it just doesn't promopt to save the file 
20:10 < inolen> are you setting the correct mime type?
20:11 < zomg> woopwoop: if you want to force the save file dialog, you need to send the Content-Disposition: attachment header
20:11 < Kakera> zomg, the download method does that
20:11 < zomg> Ah right
20:11 < Kakera> https://github.com/visionmedia/express/blob/master/lib/response.js#L364
20:11 < zomg> Yeah the rest of the headers would have to be correct as well then
20:11 < Kakera> I think it's just the mime type
20:13 < Kakera> garbagecollectio, if you don't know what this means then you probably don't need this module
20:13 < garbagecollectio> i dont think you know either kakera
20:13 < woopwoop> it generates those headers I believe, I did a console.log(res.headerSent) 
20:13 < garbagecollectio> can u explain how this interacts with opensll?
20:13 < Cronoh> I've narrowed down my issue a bit... has anyone heard of firefox making a reconnect, on disconnect?  I have a very absic chat application using socket.io, eveyrthing works but on firefox when i disconnect, it opens another connection (Which passes my validation) and disconnects right away, so when someone on FF leves, it looks like he double-left, any ideas?
20:13 < woopwoop> I've pasted it here http://pastebin.com/bYCrY7nk
20:13 < garbagecollectio> and exactly how node can reset the diffie hellman key?
20:13 < woopwoop> generates Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="test.jpg"
20:13 < garbagecollectio> does it force a diffie hellman key via the actual openssl connection?
20:14 < garbagecollectio> does it use diffie  hellman anywhere, thus i cn use it to build my own handler?
20:14 < garbagecollectio> on a server?
20:14 < Kakera> it does what the description of the methods say
20:14 < garbagecollectio> lo
20:14 < garbagecollectio> l
20:14 < woopwoop> so I guess I should fiddle more with that rather than looking for a pure nodejs solution?
20:14 < garbagecollectio> i think its not as simple as u think
20:15 < Kakera> woopwoop, and what does the browser do?
20:16 < woopwoop> doesn't do anything at all. I just see it coming back in the browser's console as binary data
20:16 < woopwoop> tried both chrome and ff
20:16 < Kakera> how do you access the download?
20:17 < woopwoop> it's all on localhost
20:17 < woopwoop> maybe that's why?
20:18 < Kakera> also what do you mean by the console
20:18 < Kakera> by any chance, are you using AJAX or something?
20:18 < woopwoop> the dev tools console in chrome/ff
20:18 < Kakera> which tab
20:19 < woopwoop> just using $.post("/getImage", function(data){ console.log(data); }); on the frontend
20:19 < Kakera> ...well of course it won't work then
20:20 < woopwoop> i've had it as a get before
20:20 < Kakera> you're doing AJAX
20:21 < woopwoop> hm, so how else would I trigger that function in node to send the image back?
20:21 < Kakera> the browser won't prompt the user about anything the script is doing
20:21 < Kakera> try simply redirecting to that URL
20:23 < woopwoop> good point browser won't do anything like that with script interaction
20:25 < ShadowChancellor> Hey, I'm new to node and writing my first basic tcp server
20:26 < ShadowChancellor> the server is listening on port 3000 of localhost
20:26 < ShadowChancellor> the socket.connect event gets fired 3x each time i refresh
20:26 < ShadowChancellor> same with the socket.close event
20:27 < ShadowChancellor> is that expected behavior for it to fire multiple times like that?
20:27 < Kakera> refresh what?
20:27 < ShadowChancellor> my browser window
20:28 < ShadowChancellor> i've got localhost:3000 open
20:28 < Kakera> TCP, not HTTP?
20:28 < ShadowChancellor> yes
20:29 < ShadowChancellor> var net = require('net')
20:29 < ShadowChancellor> net.createServer(function(socket) {
20:29 < ShadowChancellor>   socket.write('<h1>Hello TCP!</h1>')  
20:29 < ShadowChancellor>   socket.on('connect', function(data) {
20:29 < ShadowChancellor>     console.log('yo')
20:29 < ShadowChancellor>   })  
20:29 < ShadowChancellor>   socket.on('data', function(data) {
20:29 < ShadowChancellor>     socket.end('Connection data: <pre>'+data+'</pre>')
20:29 < ShadowChancellor>   })
20:29 < ShadowChancellor> }).listen(3000, 'localhost')
20:29 < ShadowChancellor> that's the full server code
20:30 < ShadowChancellor> 'yo' logs three times in the terminal when i refresh my chrome window open on localhost:3000
20:30 < Kakera> maybe the browser tries to reconnect because it doesn't understand the server
20:31 < Kakera> since it doesn't send any headers
20:31 < Cronoh> you should strongly consider pastebin in the future :D
20:31 < ShadowChancellor> haha
20:32 < ShadowChancellor> good call Cronoh
20:33 < trypwire> hey y'all. anyone here familiar with express 3.0 and socket.io?
20:33 < ShadowChancellor> Thanks Kakera
20:35 < mscdex> ShadowChancellor: if you're using a browser, you should expect at least two requests: one is the actual request, the other is a request for favicon.ico.
20:36 < Cronoh> hahaha fixed my reconnect on firefox issue... seems like firefox tries to prematurely kill the connection and re runs it on page exit for some reason
20:36 < Leeol2> Hmm.. anyone know where exactly the code for express.logger() middleware resides?
20:36 < ShadowChancellor> mscdex: ah so it emits 'connect' for every resource request?
20:36 < Cronoh> temp hack fix was to remove login credentials after first connection, which worked to prove the problem anyways
20:36 < ShadowChancellor> er network request
20:36 < mscdex> ShadowChancellor: well, unless HTTP 1.1 Connection: keepalive is negotiated
20:37 < mscdex> ShadowChancellor: try just telnet'ing into your server instead
20:38 < ShadowChancellor> mscdex: i'm running off localhost
20:38 < Kakera> Leeol2, it's in connect
20:39 < Leeol2> Kakera: Ah hah, ty
20:39 < mscdex> ShadowChancellor: ok, so `telnet localhost 3000` or whatever :-)
20:40 < ShadowChancellor> mscdex: lol god i'm a noob
20:40 < mscdex> ShadowChancellor: you do that at the command line
20:40 < mscdex> Windows or *nix
20:40 < trypwire> I'm getting an error trying to run the basic example from the socket.io website: http://socket.io/#how-to-use
20:40 < trypwire> with express3
20:40 < trypwire> http.js:644
20:40 < trypwire>     throw new Error('Can\'t set headers after they are sent.');
20:40 < trypwire> and i can't figure out why
20:42 < trypwire> all of my <script> tags pull 404's
20:43 < gildean> trypwire: as it says, you can't manipulate the response after it has been sent
20:44 < trypwire> gildean: right, but i'm not trying to. I'm just trying to dispense index.html and let socket.io make its connection
20:44 < trypwire> so i'm confused where that error is coming from
20:45 < Cronoh> can you pastebin your code
20:45 < trypwire> it's literally the example on socket.io's site: http://socket.io/#how-to-use
20:45 < trypwire> the section on using Express 3
20:46 < woopwoop> thanks guys, especially you, Kakera
20:46 < Kakera> yw
20:48 < Kakera> I don't like their code for pure http
20:48 < Kakera> they use readFile instead of piping it
20:49 < trypwire> Cronoh: http://pastebin.com/NK4vgVxn
20:50 < trypwire> i just through in the app.configure() line to see if that would fix it. no luck
20:51 < Kakera> trypwire, can you paste the whole traceback?
20:52 < trypwire> http://pastebin.com/hxQdwXWB
20:53 < trypwire> is it because my httpServer is listening and not my app?
20:54 < Sly> It looks like you're calling .writeHead after .write
20:54 < Sly> .writeHead has to be called before anything else.
20:54 < trypwire> i'm just using res.sendFile
20:54 < trypwire> sendfile*
20:55 < Sly> Are you sending headers before you use it?
20:55 < Sly> That could be the issue, calling .writeHead twice.
20:55 < trypwire> check my first pastebin
20:55 < trypwire> i never call writeHead
20:55 < trypwire> unless socket.io calls it for me
20:55 < Sly> Weird. Must be a bug in whatever you're using.
20:56 < trypwire> :( i'm not using anything lol
20:56 < trypwire> wtfff
20:56 < Sly> All I know is that error is because .writeHead is either 1) being called twice, or 2) being called after .write.
20:57 < trypwire> think i have the wrong package versions?
20:57 < Kakera> trypwire, works fine here
20:57 < trypwire> 0_0
20:57 < trypwire> what versions are you running?
20:57 < trypwire> i have socket.io 0.9.* and express 3.x
20:57 < trypwire> in my package.json
20:58 < trypwire> node version 0.9.1 (problem is probably here eh?)
20:58 < Kakera> maybe
20:58 < Kakera> express 3.0.4, socket.io 0.9.11
20:59 < trypwire> node's official version is 0.8.15
20:59 < trypwire> on the website
20:59 < trypwire> honestly idk how i got 0.9.1 lol
20:59 < Sly> I don't think the node version would make a difference, because it wouldn't need to call .writeHead itself unless .write is called without headers being sent.
20:59 < Kakera> you should find the bug and report it
20:59 < Sly> It already checks for that, afaik.
20:59 < trypwire> hm
21:00 < Sly> I've never seen Node give that error on its own. It's always been some other error, like I mentioned with the two scenarios that I can think of.
21:00 < trypwire> ok
21:00 < trypwire> what's the node debug tool?
21:00 < trypwire> node-inspector?
21:01 < Sly> I believe so.
21:02 < woopwoop> noob question, app.get('/get/:file', function(req, res){
21:02 < woopwoop>   res.send('file name: ' + req.params.file);
21:02 < woopwoop> }); how Do i actually access this with a url?
21:02 < Sly> yoururl.com/get/filename.png
21:03 < gildean> Kakera: the example app works here
21:03 < gildean> no problems
21:03 < gildean> sorry, meant trypwire 
21:04 < trypwire> gildean: that makes two people for whom it works fine :(
21:04 < trypwire> node-inspector doesn't even fire up all the way before this error comes out
21:05 < trypwire> not really sure what to try at this point
21:05 < trypwire> any ideas?
21:07 < woopwoop> thanks Sly
21:08 < woopwoop> is there an easy way to check if path = __dirname + req.params.file; exists?
21:12 < garbagecollectio> how can node access teh serial port
21:13 < trypwire> Sly, Kakera, gildean: uninstalled node and reinstalled through homebrew. error went away!
21:13 < garbagecollectio> how the fuck do they connect cpp, c, to node.js
21:13 < garbagecollectio> i dont get these abstractions how it is happening
21:13 < trypwire> is this something i should log somewhere for the version of node i was using?
21:13 < garbagecollectio> how do they interprocess it
21:13 < gildean> trypwire: which version?
21:13 < trypwire> brew installed 0.8.15
21:13 < trypwire> i was using the unstable 0.9.1
21:13 < gildean> trypwire: i'm running 0.8.15 here
21:14 < trypwire> the error i was mentioning was happening with 0.9.1
21:15 < trypwire> but is this bug something that would be useful for the node dev team?
21:15 < trypwire> i don't have a lot of information i can give them… you saw the stack tace
21:15 < trypwire> trace

21:16 < kreantos> hi
21:16 < kreantos> what is in your opinion the most stable node.js framework?
21:19 < trypwire> aahhhh finally got this shit going. wow!
21:21 < gildean> kreantos: most stable for what? also what kind of framework?
21:22 < kreantos> so right know i built webApps with java(struts and play) and ruby(rails and sinatra) and im searching for an "equivalent" for javascript-node.js
21:23 < gildean> well i like express, it's based on connect, so why not look into those two first
21:24  * mscdex shakes a fist at Java
21:25 < kreantos> gildean, thanks for the hint. i've heard of express but never from connect
21:25 < kreantos> mscdex: does Java gives you shiver?
21:25 < mscdex> kreantos: that's an understatement
21:27 < kreantos> mscdex: haha
21:31 < garbagecollectio> where can i get a argudino starter kit
21:41 < drudge> garbagecollectio: adafruit.com
21:51 < TehShrike1> garbagecollectio: Jameco
21:53 < ppppaul> hey
21:53 < ppppaul> i have a bunch of node modules symlinked to node_modules folder in my app. when i run `npm install` i don't get deps being installed for the symlinked modules
21:53 < ppppaul> any help with this
21:56 < ppppaul> ...
22:01 < Zol> Hi! How am I supposed to use libraries like 'bower' on windows? I try to run the bower.cmd in my command prompt but nothing happens. :|
22:01 < Zol> (installed it via npm of course.)
22:33 < trypwire> can you not send a socket.handshake.sessionID back to the client using socket.io?
22:39 < trypwire> or rather, how do you uniquely identify clients both on the client side and the server side with socket io?
22:42 < Kakera> is there a module for aligned console output?
22:43 < Kakera> like you have a 2-dimensional array of string and you want to output it as a neat table
22:45 < AAA_awright> Kakera: It's not terribly hard to program yourself
22:45 < Kakera> maybe
22:45 < AAA_awright> 4-5 lines or so
22:46 < AAA_awright> That's if you want to calculate the width of columns, etc
22:46 < AAA_awright> Printing is just a matter of string.substr(0,10) for right-aligned text, string.substr(-10) for left-aligned
22:49 < garbagecollectio> I'm curious in learning more about native development in Android, because I really think mobile is the way of the future. As a front-end programmer specializing in GUI development (HTML5, CSS, and a bit of javascript), I'd love to expand my skillset into the mobile market.
22:50 < garbagecollectio> what would u say of something who said that
22:50 < garbagecollectio> so fucking uninformed its ridiculous
22:50 < Hotroot> Is there anything for node where basically I write static HTML files, and then include like <node1></node1> tags that I replace dynamically when I serve the page?
22:50 < garbagecollectio> yes
22:50 < garbagecollectio> i built on
22:51 < garbagecollectio> wait what
22:51 < garbagecollectio> replace what?
22:51 < garbagecollectio> tempalting?
22:51 < Hotroot> So I could do something like res.send(page1, [username, money])
22:52 < garbagecollectio> and what would happen in the page?
22:52 < Kakera> Hotroot, jade, ejs, etc
22:52 < Hotroot> Oh, I looked at jade and it looked like it was just for writing shorter html
22:53 < AAA_awright> It's still a template
22:53 < AAA_awright> garbagecollectio: So are you looking to go into mobile development or not?
22:53 < garbagecollectio> no im saying look how dump that is
22:53 < Hotroot> ejs looks great
22:53 < Hotroot> Exactly what I was looking for
22:54 < Hotroot> Thanks
22:55 < garbagecollectio> that gives me an idea
22:55 < garbagecollectio> for a node.js constants engine
22:55 < Kakera> I don't like EJS, it looks like ASP
22:56 < degrio> how do i set a session to expire when the browser is closed in express?
22:56 < Hotroot> Kakera: It looks a little odd, but Jade looks like it's trying to convert me to a new religion
22:56 < Hotroot> I don't want to re-learn how to write html
22:57 < Kakera> I dunno, I found it very simple
22:57 < futini> i hate jade
22:58 < misterhat> (04:55:09 PM) futini: i hate jade
22:58 < misterhat> me too
22:58 < misterhat> i thought i was the only one
22:58 < misterhat> :P
23:01 < Hotroot> Oh, weird
23:01 < chomwitt> hi. can i ask sth about socket.io ?
23:01 < Hotroot> So EJS is client side
23:01 < Hotroot> Guess that helps with caching
23:02 < ppppaul> anyone deal with Q here?
23:02 < ppppaul> i'm using qhttp and i'm trying to send a post request and it's stalling
23:02 < Hotroot> ppppaul: Not since The Next Generation
23:02 < ppppaul> ...
23:02 < Hotroot> Although I hear Janeway had some trouble with him
23:05 < Hotroot> Yeah, ejs looked better before I read the docs
23:09 < ppppaul> my head asploded
23:11 < garbagecollectio> ejs is crap
23:11 < garbagecollectio> we need a new node templating engine
23:12 < degrio> ther's always jade
23:13 -!- mode/#node.js [+o piscisaureus_] by ChanServ
23:21 < AAA_awright> Yeah Jade works
23:21 < ppppaul> i use dust
23:22 < ppppaul> async templates ftw
23:23 < Zelest> If I write a session.js, include it using require(), run a var s = new Session(req, res, db); .. can I somehow edit req from the calling function (like i pass a pointer to req rather than a copy of req) ?
23:24 < Zelest> also, inside Session(), I have a this.foo = function() { ... } but when I run s.foo(), i seem to fail to return properly.. 
23:24 < ppppaul> i sometimes fail to return properly too
23:25 < Zelest> argh, this piss me off :S
23:31 < Zelest> ah, seems to work as i expected now.. sadly though, i need to rewrite it, seeing i can't modify the variables i planned to modify.. crap :P
23:34 < Zelest> is there any way i can execute code before and after the http request? (sort of like a constructor, destructor for the request callback)
23:34 < Zelest> and/or in expressjs, since that's what I use
23:36 < SomeoneWeird> middleware
23:38 < Zelest> but will that handle/share the same req? like, if I edit the req in the constructor, is it modified in the http callback and the destructor as well?
23:39 < Zelest> also, do i need two middlewears? one before the router and one after? or can you magically combine that into the same module?
23:42 < ashnur> what is a good html to markdown converter? i've found too many, maybe someone here knows one which works well and is maintained?
23:47 < SomeoneWeird> yes and yes Zelest 
23:48 < Zelest> SomeoneWeird, why do I _need_ two middlewears if i can do it magically in the same module? :P
23:48 < SomeoneWeird> >.>
23:48 < SomeoneWeird> yes to first question, yes to first question in second sentence
23:48 < SomeoneWeird> lol
23:49 < Zelest> ah :)
23:49 < Zelest> thanks :)
23:49 < Zelest> there should be some sort of condition for the session part in express
23:50 < Zelest> like, loading the session thingie for every single users no matter where on the site they are is a bit stupid imo
23:51 < SomeoneWeird> app.get('/', middleware1, function(req, res) { /* logic */ }, middleware2, middleware3);
23:51 < SomeoneWeird> etc
23:51 < SomeoneWeird> or you can use app.use to load the middleware globally
23:51 < Zelest> oh
23:52 < Zelest> had no idea you could setup middlewear per-get :o
23:52 < SomeoneWeird> yerp
23:52 < SomeoneWeird> just remember to call next() :p
23:52 < Zelest> mhm
23:54 < Hotroot> Yeah, expresses description of middle ware is not so good, I've thought they should rewrite it for a while now
23:55 < garbagecollectio> i should have made express
23:56 < Zelest> argh
23:56  * Zelest feeds /dev/null his code
23:56 < Zelest> worthless piece of crap code
23:56 < Zelest> work already!
23:59 < garbagecollectio> yo
23:59 < garbagecollectio> can i install node on osx
23:59 < garbagecollectio> normally
23:59 < garbagecollectio> just like i do on linux
