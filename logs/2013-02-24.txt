00:04 < jtomasrl> should i use varnish as an http proxy ar put it before a proxy ?
00:16 < someprimetime_> so… what am I doing wrong here: http://jsfiddle.net/KsZww/
00:16 < someprimetime_> to get my own session flash working
00:16 < someprimetime_> that's pretty much it no?
00:19 < someprimetime_> yo hallas can you scope that please
00:20 < hallas> error and success is mixed up in your middleware
00:20 < hallas> might aswell use res.locals also
00:21 < hallas> other than that looks fine, might aswell do app.use(flashMessages); before the router is added to the stack
00:22 < hallas> unless you really want that control @someprimetime_ 
00:23 < robinson_k> that moment you made a pull request to npm-www and recognize six minutes later that you committed one semicolon :(
00:23 < hallas> app.locals will not be cleaned up
00:24 < hallas> in my opinion, even accessing app directly from a route 
00:24 < hallas> err, from a middleware function, shouldnt be done
00:24 < hallas> use req.app
00:24 < someprimetime_> ah that's right.. you *just* told me to use `res` my mistake
00:24 < hallas> its cleaner and wont break when you refactor into seperate controllers
00:24 < someprimetime_> wait what?
00:25 < someprimetime_> didn't catch the last part really
00:25 < ugarit> what's the preferred paste website for this channel?
00:25 < robinson_k> hrm, should i rebase the pull request now?
00:25 < hallas> well, the only reason you can even do app.locals is because you're defining your routes and their respective middleware is because its in the same file where the app is a part of the scope
00:25 < boogyman> there isn't
00:26 < hallas> but once you have middleware in files where the app object is not defined
00:26 < hallas> it'll break
00:26 <@isaacbw> ugarit: hastebin if you want to be cool
00:26 <@isaacbw> gist if you're a sheeple
00:26 < hallas> therefor there is a reference to the app object in the request object, so you can still access it, for example to read settings and stuff
00:27 < hallas> its not gonna do anything in your case, @someprimetime_, just pointing it out for later :)
00:27 < someprimetime_> hallas: well I wasn't planning on keeping everything in app.js and was about to put them into ./config/routes.js instead
00:28 < hallas> then you'd wonna do what I suggested
00:28 < someprimetime_> and just go require('./config/routes.js');
00:28 < someprimetime_> err
00:28 < someprimetime_> require('./config/routes.js')(app)
00:28 < someprimetime_> ah ok thanks
00:28 < someprimetime_> I'll try thst
00:28 < someprimetime_> s/st/at
00:28 < hallas> dont pass the app as an argument unless you really have to
00:28 < hallas> when it comes to routes, you dont have too
00:28 < someprimetime_> ok good to know
00:29 < someprimetime_> what does that do though?
00:29 < someprimetime_> (if i did do that it)
00:29 < someprimetime_> just curious
00:29 <@isaacbw> no js
00:29 <@isaacbw> *.js
00:30 < ugarit> Where do I put the memcached in my code http://hastebin.com/vetiguhona.coffee ?  I want each row to be set in mamcached, but the asyncronous part is confusing me
00:30 <@isaacbw> do you know what memcached is
00:30 < hallas> there is some technical stuff specific to the V8 interpreter that I'm not sure of, but a rule of thumb, dont create references that you dont need, it only means more memory consumption and more garbage to clean up
00:30 < ugarit> isaacbw yes, I've used it.
00:30 < hallas> Only pass app to a module if you need to use the object from outside the middleware stack
00:31 < ugarit> isaacbw I'm new to node
00:31 < someprimetime_> ah +1
00:31 < hallas> @someprimetime_ just to be clear, i realize i might have mislead you now :)
00:32 < hallas> you'd obviously need to pass the app to the routes, in order to define the routes
00:32 < hallas> but when you create controllers, you shouldnt
00:33 < someprimetime_> hallas: ok, np
00:33 < someprimetime_> but this modification didn't really affect anything
00:33 < someprimetime_> now I get an error: http://jsfiddle.net/KsZww/1/
00:33 < someprimetime_> TypeError: Cannot read property 'messages' of undefined
00:33 < someprimetime_> but if i switch the order of app.use(app.router) it works but the flashes won't show.
00:36 < ugarit> Where do I put the memcached in my code http://hastebin.com/vetiguhona.coffee ?  I want each row to be set in mamcached, but the asyncronous part is confusing me. I'm using http.createserver
00:37 < mikolalysenko> is there a simple way to get the system endianness in node?
00:38 <@isaacbw> why would you need that mikolalysenko 
00:38 < carpii> any tips for running my node server as a service via init.d ?
00:39 < mikolalysenko> isaacbw: I have an array buffer view I am using
00:39 <@isaacbw> array buffer 'view'?
00:39 < mikolalysenko> yeah, in the typed array spec you can make multiple views of the same buffer
00:39 < mikolalysenko> but the behavior depends on system endianness
00:39 < mikolalysenko> http://www.khronos.org/registry/typedarray/specs/latest/
00:40 < hallas> @someprimetime_ it shouldnt be req.app.session
00:40 < hallas> its req.session
00:41 < mikolalysenko> here is an example:
00:41 < mikolalysenko> var buf = new Uint8Array(4)
00:41 < mikolalysenko> buf[0] = 1
00:41 < mikolalysenko> console.log((new Int32Array(buf.buffer))[0])
00:41 < someprimetime_> ah well what did you mean when you said `hallas: use req.app` ?
00:41 <@isaacbw> what are you going to do with it
00:41 < someprimetime_> sorry i'm just hung up on that 
00:41 < mikolalysenko> convert a file 
00:41 < mikolalysenko> I am writing a .ply parser
00:41 < hallas> someprimetime_ when you use app, you should use req.app, when you use req, just use req :D
00:42 < mikolalysenko> and I want to use this behavior to convert a binary buffer -> float
00:42 < someprimetime_> ahh ahah ok thanks
00:42 < someprimetime_> makes sense now.
00:42 < hallas> but req.app is for when your inside the middleware scope
00:42 < mikolalysenko> there are also two endian formats for ply, so I need to switch depending on what system I am running
00:42 < someprimetime_> hallas: why would I still be getting this error: `500 TypeError: Cannot read property 'success' of undefined`?
00:42 < someprimetime_> should my app.use() go before or after app.router?
00:42 < hallas> before
00:42 < someprimetime_> probably before right? so it can send it to the routes?
00:42 < hallas> messages is probably not defined
00:42 < hallas> its empty
00:43 < mikolalysenko> never mind, I'll just make a module to test system endianness
00:51 < someprimetime_> hallas: so now when I POST to contact I'm setting req.session.messages['error'] to my error message and redirecting to '/'…  which should now checks to see if req.session.messages exists… and there is no error message and when I output res.locals within my app.use() I get this: { [Function: locals], flashSuccess: undefined, flashError: undefined }
00:52 < someprimetime_> this is what I have in there: http://jsfiddle.net/KsZww/3
00:53 < someprimetime_> either i'm overlooking something very simple or there is something majorly wrong
00:53 < someprimetime_> at this point i just don't know
00:55 < hallas> someprimetime_ from here on
00:55 < hallas> it can only be one thing :)
00:55 < hallas> you're sessions are not being stored
00:56 < hallas> http://jsfiddle.net/KsZww/5/ should do you good
00:57 < hallas> it specifically uses the cookie to store
00:57 < mikolalysenko> isaacbw: done, https://github.com/mikolalysenko/is-little-endian
00:58 < hallas> someprimetime_ i changed the contact to a get for my convenience
00:59 <@isaacbw> mikolalysenko: what a wonderful hack
00:59 < crazydiamond1> Hi. Can anyone suggest jade language channel?
00:59 < mikolalysenko> yeah, seems somewhat obvious though; but couldn't find anything on npm that immediately did the same
01:00 < someprimetime_> hallas: ok thanks trying this now
01:00 < hallas> someprimetime_the session can be stored differently, memory, cookie, redis even
01:00 < hallas> per default i think it is just discarded (not sure though)
01:06 < someprimetime_> hallas: ah so I have to explicitly send res.locals.flashError?
01:06 < someprimetime_> like in my app.get('/')?
01:06 < someprimetime_> is there no way to just always send it?
01:06 < someprimetime_> like on all requests
01:06 < someprimetime_> to all routes
01:07 < hallas> the middleware sends it
01:07 < hallas> applied to the locals every request
01:07 < hallas> you can just replace res.send(…) with your res.render('index')
01:07 < someprimetime_> oh shit!
01:07 < someprimetime_> it works
01:08 < someprimetime_> hell yeah man thanks so much.
01:08 < someprimetime_> i don't know who you are hallas , but I like you!
01:08 < someprimetime_> :D
01:08 < hallas> follow me on twitter and on github and ill be happy :)
01:08 < someprimetime_> links please
01:11 < hipsters_> why reinvent things for flash messages? just install connect-flash and if you need it express-messages
01:12 < hallas> hipsters_ i think its just an exercise
01:13 < hipsters_> oh well, fair enough then. looking through them as an example of how to go about it right might be good though
01:14 < hallas> i think he started out with connect-flash, turns out the issue was just a non persistant session store
01:14 < hallas> would probably have worked fine

01:36 < ugarit> beware newbie and not experienced with asynchronous coding. Why does my for loop repeat 0, 1, 2, 3 and why are json rows repeated in this code http://hastebin.com/lesifogiki.vhdl ?
01:42 < tassmjau> hey, I'm switching from mongoose to mongodb.MongoClient on a project I'm working on, does anyone know if there's some way to write virtual/pre methods on schemas in mongoclient?
01:43 <@isaacbw> MongoClient doesn't have schemas
01:45 < tassmjau> isaacbw: yeah, I know, but those pre-methods usually come in so handy :)
01:46 < tassmjau> guess I'll just decorate my stuff instead..
01:47 <@isaacbw> the native client is much lower level than mongoose

01:47 < SomeoneWeird> <tassmjau> hey, I'm switching from mongoose to mongodb.MongoClient < why?
01:47 <@isaacbw> I prefer the native client
01:48 < ugarit> Why does my for loop repeat 0, 1, 2, 3 twice and why are json rows repeated in this code http://hastebin.com/lesifogiki.vhdl ?
01:49 < tassmjau> SomeoneWeird: I wrote this code base a while back, and have been working on a different project(with the native client) for a couple of weeks, I felt like trying it out ont this one :)
01:50 < SomeoneWeird> ic
01:50 < tassmjau> SomeoneWeird: you prefer mongoose?
02:07 < astropirate> Why are there both App.js and node-webkit?
02:07 < astropirate> don't they do the same thing?
02:09 < jrajav> Yeah, pretty much
02:09 < mephux> hello everyone.. is there a way to get unix select type functionality in nodejs. Mostly to tell if a stream is readable.
02:09 < jrajav> node-webkit is just there though, App.js is a little hipster about it :P
02:09 < jrajav> I personally use node-webkit, it works great
02:09 < astropirate> jrajav, ohh i thought app.js came first
02:09 < jrajav> I don't know which came first
02:10 < jrajav> I meant that node-webkit doesn't have a flashy "Web 3.0" homepage
02:10 < mephux> or will i have to do it by hand.. like this for example https://gist.github.com/shinout/1750489
02:32 < vampi-the-frog> hey guys, any idea how I can use connect.use() to get a callback function for any URL that's like /foo/123, where 123 is any number?
02:34 < vampi-the-frog> well it looks like I just need to pass '/foo' as the first argument. thanks

04:31 < Havvy> andrewaclt: Look at what mysql_real_escape_string does in PHP
04:31 < Havvy> Or use a library that already gives you that.
04:32 < lohkey> ore just use prepared statements and paramatarized queries
04:36 < RLa> why not use mysql module?

05:08 < WotWhere> hi,  where is this being set in the path variable ?  c:\users\auser\appdata\roaming\npm   
05:09 < WotWhere> or which script is seting tha npm in the path?
05:09 < jtomasrl> what should i use to cache https requests on my node server
06:17 < Anup> Hello
06:18 < Anup> I have a query regarding nodejs... anybody there?
06:21 < gkatsev> no one here. Move along.
06:21 < rlfcptr> plenty are, ask and you'll likely get a response
06:33 < owen1> what folder on linux is it common to deploy the project into?
06:38 < Havvy> owen1: ~
06:39 < gkatsev> /var/www?
06:40 < gkatsev> /opt
06:40 < gkatsev> /srv
06:40 < asdf12> C:\windows
06:40 < gkatsev> asdf12: lol
06:44 < Havvy> owen1: There's no real standard. Projects are self contained.
07:02 < owen1> Havvy: nice. thank you
07:02 < owen1> gkatsev: i like /var/www but sometimes it's not web-based
07:16 < finishingmove> Hello node.js
07:17 < geNAZt> hi
07:20 < geNAZt> does someone know a benchmark.js suite for benchmarking http servers ?
07:22 < owen1> geNAZt: https://github.com/oren/oren.github.com/blob/master/posts/benchmark.md
07:23 < geNAZt> no i already use benchmark.js but i only search a site that provides "most used" tes cases in a benchmark.js suite
07:23 < geNAZt> ps.s. creating a new Date object is slow :D
07:27 < WotWhere> hi, where is this being set in the path variable ? c:\users\auser\appdata\roaming\npm 
07:27 < WotWhere> or which script is seting tha npm in the path?
07:29 < WotWhere> its not being set by nodejsvars.bat  so where?
07:30 < geNAZt> its set into your env PATH variable
07:30 < geNAZt> which will be set by windows
07:30 < geNAZt> the installer adds the directory to it
07:31 < WotWhere> huh... but when i check my environment vars.. it doesnt show up there why?
07:32 < geNAZt> maybe you installed node wrong
07:34 < WotWhere> no it works..  just wanted to know which script puts the npm into path var .. i did move the node dir after installation 
07:35 < WotWhere> also the above mentioned dir is empty
07:36 < geNAZt> for normal the installer for node sets it
07:36 < WotWhere> i have installed express ejs stylus and made a small app.. it works..  am i missing something?
07:37 < WotWhere> but y wont it show up in the environment variables ? so i can remove it
07:46 < geNAZt> why should it show up in the env ?
07:46 < Havvy> WotWhere: Unless you installed them globablly, they are in a subdirectory called node_modules
07:47 < Havvy> If you installed them globally, remove with `sudo npm rm package`
07:47 < Havvy> If you installed them globally, remove with `sudo npm rm package -g` **
07:48 < WotWhere> i want to remove the 'c:\users\auser\appdata\roaming\npm'   in the path env var   dont know where its being set or by which script
07:49 < geNAZt> it is set by windows
07:49 < geNAZt> you must set it in the system config
07:50 < geNAZt> http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm
07:54 < WotWhere> yes.. i open the "Environment variables" window but "c:\users\auser\appdata\roaming\npm" is not listed there.. but when i do an echo %PATH it shows up there in the DOS command prompt 
07:54 < geNAZt> restart your prompt
07:58 < WotWhere> ok its still there.. and i just rechecked "Env vars" does not have that
07:59 < geNAZt> there is a var called "path"
07:59 < geNAZt> there you must delete it from
07:59 < geNAZt> not the complete path variable only the part you want
07:59 < HexSquid> Oh wow this room is popular :)
08:04 < WotWhere> thanks @geNAZt.. will make a .bat file and reset the path var.. but still dont understand y it doesnt show  in the "Env Vars" window
08:06 < asdf12> https://github.com/lovebear/intercept.js interrrcepppttttt
08:06 < asdf12> ^ intercepting functions
08:09 < geNAZt> its like rollback for objects or not ?
08:09 < asdf12> no there's no rollback
08:10 < asdf12> it's like if you intercept myfunc, and you call myfunc();
08:10 < asdf12> it never gets called, your intercepting function gets called
08:11 < geNAZt> but what is the use case of intercepted functions ?
08:11 < asdf12> theres a few, but its literally new ground, you never had the ability before, so you don't know what to do with it :P
08:12 < asdf12> but one is to use it for mocking functions in tests
08:12 < geNAZt> ah okay its a "cause i can" thing :D
08:12 < asdf12> or using it as a easier way of saying if (err) intercept(Database, save, recover) // ex: if there's an error and you call save(), it won't save
08:12 < asdf12> it'll call your recover() func
08:13 < geNAZt> which is a rollback :D
08:13 < asdf12> well in that example, you can use it as a database roll back sure
08:14 < asdf12> that's not a new solution though, it's just a different way of writing it
08:14 < asdf12> but literally, new territory, so who knows what cool stuff can be done
08:14 < geNAZt> yes it should save you a bit of errorhandling
08:15 < asdf12> a lot of it is just making existing ways of doing something easier
08:16 < geNAZt> yes
08:17 < geNAZt> the thing that you never touch the function body is nice so you can wrap in anything
08:17 < asdf12> yes you dont need to blow up your existing code
08:18 < asdf12> or write new code.. but the lib enforces a certain way of doing things
08:18 < geNAZt> yes you must throw errors 
08:20 < WotWhere> geNAZt : problem remains.. i have reset the Path var.. but when i open a new cmd window the c:\users\auser\appdata\roaming\npm  dir shows up again.. 
08:22 < WotWhere> Also when i open cmd as administrator.. it doesnt show there.. so it must be about my home dir there is a .npmrc there but that has the correct paths
08:23 < geNAZt> then you should check your account env variables
08:23 < geNAZt> which should be in the same setting window
08:24 < triptec> is there anyone here who have used the racer module
08:24 < triptec> ?
08:24 < WotWhere> user env vars only has temp and tmp.. pointing to dirs.. am checking those
08:24 < triptec> I'm wondering how the accesscontrol should be set up
08:31 < pats_Toms> morning
08:31 < pats_Toms> haha http://youtu.be/1e1zzna-dNw
08:31 < geNAZt> well nothing new......
08:32 < WotWhere> Thanks a Heap @geNAZt .. that was it .. users  environment vars .. in my idiocy.. i was always checking the admins env vars .. thanks again for Help on using Windows :)
08:32 < geNAZt> no problem :D
08:36 < Daynab> Hi all, wondering if I could get some pointers - this is baby's first node project. I need to serve/do something with the contents of a few xml files, but I'm not sure where to start or what module to use. I was first thinking about parsing the relevant bits to a json file and then doing something with it, but I don't know if it's a good idea
08:36 < geNAZt> do the xml files always look the same ?
08:36 < asdf12> whos baby
08:36 < geNAZt> if not you need a dom parser
08:36 < Daynab> it's basically a one-page site with what would be content from those files
08:36 < Daynab> I'm baby
08:37 < asdf12> why do you refer to yourself as baby
08:37 < Daynab> cause I have the knowledge of a baby with node
08:37 < Daynab> and what do you mean by always look the same?
08:37 < gkatsev> same xml format
08:37 < geNAZt> is the structure the same ?
08:37 < Daynab> oh, yes.
08:37 < geNAZt> is the data you search for the same
08:38 < geNAZt> may be you should regex search after them
08:38 < SomeoneWeird> use xml2json
08:38 < SomeoneWeird> and then parse the json
08:38 < SomeoneWeird> LOL
08:38 < SomeoneWeird> don't use regexs to parse xml
08:38 < geNAZt> no parse
08:38 < geNAZt> search
08:38 < SomeoneWeird> still a very bad idea
08:38 < Daynab> it's a lot of content, so I doubt regex would be usable. We're talking hundreds of lines
08:39 < geNAZt> you dont need to parse a whole xml file into a json to reparse it if you search one line in an xml
08:39 < Daynab> if not thousands
08:39 < SomeoneWeird> geNAZt, yes you do
08:39 < SomeoneWeird> :P
08:39 < Daynab> I'll check xml2json, thanks
08:39 < geNAZt> yes if you want it to be slow as hell :D
08:39 < SomeoneWeird> barely
08:39 < Daynab> but then I'm wondering - how would I handle the data after? I dont want to parse the json everytime the site's accessed
08:40 < Daynab> that doesnt seem very efficient
08:40 < geNAZt> but why do you use xml as data files ?
08:40 < geNAZt> or do they come out of a api ?
08:41 < Daynab> it's a long story - I'm making a sort of encyclopedia of a game's data. There's always a site like it but it's all client side and takes 1 minute to start, so I thought it'd be a fun project to try server side
08:41 < Daynab> stuff like items and such are stored in xml
08:41 < geNAZt> so you only need a one time convert ?
08:41 < Daynab> yep
08:42 < HexSquid> Oh gee, convert it once and store it as .json
08:42 < geNAZt> or store it in an redis store or mongo
08:42 < geNAZt> or some other sort of database
08:42 < Daynab> okay but once it's a json, then what?
08:42 < geNAZt> you can use it as ann normal variable
08:42 < HexSquid> Does it need to change over time? Will you be adding to the data?
08:42 < Daynab> (sorry for the cluelessness, I'm pretty new at server side stuff)
08:43 < SomeoneWeird> then just read it each time you start your app ?
08:43 < Daynab> I'll have to use new xml files maybe once every few months, but I can just convert it then 
08:43 < geNAZt> how much data is it ?
08:44 < geNAZt> and the final question: do you search in the data ?
08:44 < HexSquid> Haha +!
08:44 < HexSquid> Haha +1
08:45 < conancat> hi guys! any mongoose users here? 
08:45 < Daynab> <5mb worth of xml maybe? a few thousand lines. I just want to parse it then use it in a html page
08:45 < conancat> anyone have time to test out a plugin i wrote for mongoose? 
08:46 < geNAZt> then you can store it in memory
08:46 < geNAZt> so you dont need to convert it into a json
09:25 < AAA_awright> GNU Make is officially one of the coolest programs there is
09:25 < AAA_awright> Says me
09:29 < Voting> Sorry about this but my server needs to be RoR for this client... ow should I push data into a browser if I care about reliability AND cross browser compatibility? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15047637/pushing-data-into-a-browser-from-jruby-highly-reliable-websockets-package-or-wh ... suggestions? 
09:30 < Gambit-> AAA_awright, every time someone uses gnu make for their project, a small kitten is crushed.
09:30 < asdf12> websockets is out if it needs to be browser compatible
09:30 < geNAZt> socket.io is good for cross browser things
09:30 < geNAZt> but i dont know if there is an ruby inplementation
09:30 < AAA_awright> Gambit-: s/make/autotools/
09:31 < Gambit-> AAA_awright, s/kitten/litter of puppies/
09:31 < Gambit-> or, grammatically correct:
09:31 < Gambit-> AAA_awright, s/kitten is/litter of puppies are/
09:31 < AAA_awright> Well, that too
09:32 < Gambit-> anyone awake who knows node's "gyp" build system enough to tell me the necessary command to build everything - deps, .o's, etc - but not perform the last link step?
09:38 < AAA_awright> Gambit-: And you say Make kills kittens?
09:38 < AAA_awright> What's the error you're getting
09:39 < Gambit-> AAA_awright, gyp is worse, imho.
09:39 < Gambit-> AAA_awright, not an actual error.  For reasons best left undiscussed, I need to build everything up-to-but-not-including the final link step.
09:40 < AAA_awright> Well build the final product and ignore it?
09:40 < Gambit-> can't.
09:40 < AAA_awright> WHy
09:40 < Gambit-> due to reasons I really don't want to go into, I've lobotomized libuv out of node.
09:40 < AAA_awright> You'll get, what, an error? So what
09:40 < Gambit-> Those symbols will be supplied later.
09:40 < Gambit-> well, (a) it fucks up the build process, (b) it looks ugly, and (c) it's harder to tell if you've broken something else.
09:43 < AAA_awright> Also, which other system is cool enough that you can specify a recipe that has a preresiquite on *some* file, containing a wildcard, invokes a recipie to generate a file matching that wildcard, and returns to the recipie the filename with wildcard filled in
09:43 < Gambit-> that sounds like a pretty normal build system requirement.
09:44 < AAA_awright> While you're modifying Node.js internals you'll probably have to comment out the final link step, and `touch` that file instead
09:44 < Gambit-> fuck.
09:45 < Gambit-> if I could even /find/ where that final link step occured.
09:45 < TheDukeofURL> hey y'all 
09:46 < Gambit-> oh wait
09:46 < Gambit-> out/node.target.mk looks incredibly possible.
09:46 < TheDukeofURL> I've a question, what module exists to keep node running while i edit the app?
09:46 < Gambit-> TheAceOfHearts and TheDukeofURL need to get together sometime.
09:47 < TheDukeofURL> heh
09:47 < Gambit-> anyways, you want to live upgrade an app, basically?
09:47 < TheDukeofURL> yea like i edit file
09:47 < TheDukeofURL> it shuts down and restarts the app
09:47 < geNAZt> nodemon or nodev
09:47 < TheDukeofURL> automagically
09:47 < TheDukeofURL> any preference?
09:47 < asdf12> automagically??
09:47 < asdf12> sounds dangerous
09:47 < TheDukeofURL> thats a word!
09:47 < TheDukeofURL> i think
09:48 < geNAZt> use nodev for development
09:48 < geNAZt> and nodemon for normal uses
09:48 < TheDukeofURL> ok thanx for the advice
09:48 < geNAZt> nodev spawns a nodeinspector on restart for remote debugging
09:49 < TheDukeofURL> oooOOOooo
09:49 < Gambit-> arrgh, of course gyp autorecreates that file *facepalm*
09:49 < geNAZt> nodemon doesnt but keeps restarting the app if files changes
09:50 < geNAZt> or you look on forever if you finished building which also handles app crashes
09:50 < AAA_awright> Everyone bug bnoordhuis to get python out of Node.js
09:50 < AAA_awright> That crap has been in Git for too long
09:50 < AAA_awright> and ryah, etc
09:51 < asdf12> http://img-cdn.mediaplex.com/0/16357/03365_twist_scarves_728x90.jpg
09:52 < AAA_awright> "Sweatshop free" Um, that's a bad thing...
09:53 < asdf12> twist scarves yo
09:53 < AAA_awright> What is it with people and complete ignorance of economics that's literally been around since Wealth of Nations... "Made in the USA because we WANT to raise prices and starve little children into prostitution!"
10:23 < instinkt> Hi everyone. I'm trying to install node 0.6.7 through n but it says it cannot find that version. Why is this?
10:24 < instinkt> It used to work fine like 2 months ago.
10:38 < darrenlooby> Hi Guys, Socket.io room is a little quite today. So, posting here. Getting 404 on socket.io.js and unable to make a connection - only thing that's changed about my environment is it's not on my laptop - not a remote server. Code is the same, and all dependencies too. https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5023335
10:44 < bobby_> hhey can anyone help me with this question http://stackoverflow.com/q/15038054/462951
10:44 < bobby_> im getting a socket hanup error http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15038054/node-js-socket-hang-up-error-when-connecting-to-twitter-api
10:47 < bobby_> hhey can anyone help me with this question http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15038054/node-js-socket-hang-up-error-when-connecting-to-twitter-api
10:48 < darrenlooby> bobby_,  what line is that error occurring?
10:48 < bobby_> it just throwing the error, i think something is wrong with authorization
10:49 < darrenlooby> Do you have a trace of errors in your console?
10:50 < bobby_> no i have caught the error using request.on(error, function);
10:52 < darrenlooby> Are you able to print out the request url that it's made?
10:52 < darrenlooby> To see what url it's actually requesting
10:53 < asdf12> bobby_: try options.auth = '$username:$password'
10:53 < bobby_> ok il will try it..
10:53 < asdf12> dont set your auth headers
10:53 < bobby_> okay!!
10:54 < asdf12> well okay!
10:54 < bobby_> @darrenloopy how to print the request url
10:55 < bobby_> 		console.log("Received Request:" + request.url);
10:56 < bobby_> @asdf12 where should i write options.auth code
10:57 < asdf12> just replace headers: { } with auth: ''
10:57 < bobby_> okay..il will do it
10:57 < asdf12> i dont think its an auth problem though
10:57 < asdf12> just saying you dont need to set the header yourself
10:58 < nickoe> is this bad? http://dpaste.com/985204/
10:58 < bobby_> iokay!! i tried still gwtting same error --- 		auth: username + ":" + password
10:59 < nickoe> I am trying to build v0.6.21
10:59 < darrenlooby> Have a quick look at this http question
10:59 < darrenlooby> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3905126/how-to-use-http-client-in-node-js-if-there-is-basic-authorization
11:00 < bobby_> i have seen the question before...it is structured same as my code..
11:01 < bobby_> i have tried this way too .. http://stackoverflow.com/a/6436986/462951
11:01 < asdf12> socket hang up probably means the server didn't even get your request
11:02 < asdf12> if it was an auth issue, you would've gotten a response
11:02 < bobby_> hmm...where could it go wrong
11:05 < bobby_> When i tried console.log("Received Request:" + request.url);
11:05 < bobby_> It says request is undefined.
11:14 < darrenlooby> Right, change ... var request = https.request(options, function(response){
11:14 < darrenlooby> to ... var request = https.get(options, function(response){
11:14 < darrenlooby> bobby_, give that a go - it worked for me
11:14 < jetienne> .
11:14 < bobby_> thnks i ill try it!!
11:15 < bobby_> @darrenlooby  thanks it worked perfectly!!
11:15 < bobby_> can you tell me what i did wring
11:16 < bobby_> wrong*
11:16 < darrenlooby> I only wish I  could...
11:16 < darrenlooby> I just compared your code to lots of other examples of how to build requests - and spotted a difference
11:16 < darrenlooby> So, evidently *.request is better as *.get
11:17 < darrenlooby> You also don't need to declare "GET" in the options as a result
11:17 < bobby_> hmmm....thanks...
11:17 < darrenlooby> From my code anyway
11:18 < darrenlooby> If I were to guess - *.request builds the request, but doesn't send it (there might be another trigger) and *.get actually goes full circle
11:18 < darrenlooby> But, that could be complete bollocks! lol
11:18 < bobby_> ha ha
11:18 < bobby_> im starting with node.js 
11:18 < darrenlooby> Glad I could help
11:18 < darrenlooby> I'm pretty n00b too
11:19 < bobby_> you are good..!
11:19 < darrenlooby> I'm having a headache with socket.io at the moment - made even more annoying by the fact that my code was 100% working on a different machine
11:20 < darrenlooby> But, now I've got my code on the same machine I'm opening the page from - nada!
11:20 < bobby_> i havent started learning socket.io yet.. got stuck with this issue from yesterday
11:20 < darrenlooby> It's wonderful stuff
11:21 < bobby_> It should work!- a programmer's last words.
11:21 < darrenlooby> Traffic is smaller than http(s) requests too.
11:21 < bobby_> ha ha
11:21 < darrenlooby> haha
11:21 < darrenlooby> What you building?
11:21 < bobby_> hmm...
11:22 < bobby_> i just learning and  practicing with examples..
11:22 < darrenlooby> I'm working on an IDE - it's very basic. But Cloud9 does my head it, because it is dependant on old code... and I've not yet made it work on my own hosting... pain in the ass...
11:22 < bobby_> getting familiar with node.js
11:22 < darrenlooby> So, I decided to roll my own IDE and see if I can pull something together
11:22 < bobby_> hmm..
11:23 < bobby_> you got it on github?
11:23 < darrenlooby> I save the files to database, to keep versions - and then overwrite the hardfile each save, then re-run the aoo
11:23 < darrenlooby> *app
11:23 < darrenlooby> And now, it's broken as socket.io has fallen over
11:24 < bobby_> hmm..
11:25 < darrenlooby> When I have it in working order - with all the basic functions I need, I'll put it up
11:26 < bobby_> what languages are you supporting in your  IDE
11:27 < darrenlooby> Any...
11:28 < darrenlooby> The editor formatting supports javascript, php etc...
11:28 < darrenlooby> But, there is a plain text mode that you can write anything you like to
11:28 < bobby_> do you use any plugin for formatting
11:28 < darrenlooby> The deploy methods will allow you to use various options - and include commands to run it
11:28 < darrenlooby> Yea, I'm using CodeMirror
11:29 < bobby_> hmm...
11:29 < bobby_> what features are you trying to incorporate in it
11:30 < darrenlooby> Well, I'm currently just putting together the core features - loading files into it etc
11:31 < darrenlooby> That'll all happen over socket.io - so I'm not making progress without that functioning correctly
11:31 < bobby_> hmm...
11:32 < darrenlooby> I got the saves working, and was planning on doing the loading today... but, hey... seems like I'm not going to manage that in the next few hours
11:34 < bobby_> yea..thats programming..you get stuck often..you'll work through it
11:40 < darrenlooby> Can anyone help with this? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5023335
11:44 < geNAZt> maybe not a valid ssl cert ?
11:44 < darrenlooby> Hmmm... interesting...
11:45 < darrenlooby> I'll dive in and change them, and report back
11:45 < geNAZt> do you need ssl ? or is it only cause it looks safer ?
11:47 < darrenlooby> I tend to prefer it
11:47 < darrenlooby> It'll be handling people code
11:48 < geNAZt> on your server you have a full ssl cert ?
11:48 < geNAZt> or "just" a self built one
11:48 < darrenlooby> So, it's liking that end users will like it https
11:48 < darrenlooby> It's self-signed at the moment
11:48 < darrenlooby> I'll get a better one later
11:48 < geNAZt> okay so you want the whole data to be safed in the connection
11:49 < darrenlooby> Re-signed and created new ones - still the same error
11:49 < geNAZt> for which domain you create the ssl ?
11:50 < geNAZt> localhost or ?
11:51 < darrenlooby> Didn't supply a domain to it
11:51 < geNAZt> maybe you should
11:52 < darrenlooby> It worked on my server, but willing to get anything ago
11:52 < geNAZt> you had no domain in the server ssl ?
11:53 < geNAZt> do the nodejs versions differ from the server to your laptop ?
11:53 < geNAZt> i think they changed the ssl version not long time ago
11:56 < darrenlooby> I had no domain in the server ssl
11:56 < darrenlooby> The node version is the same as on the server
11:56 < darrenlooby> The website comes up - served through NodeJS
11:57 < geNAZt> the thing i wonder about is that you get an response on http(port 80) when you start express on https(443)
11:57 < darrenlooby> The only issue I'm having is the socket.io bit
11:57 < davidisawesome> Hello
11:57 < geNAZt> so where does the http 80 server come from
11:57 < darrenlooby> As I'm not attaching a server to port 80 - socket.io does that on it's own
11:57 < darrenlooby> As that's the default
11:58 < geNAZt> but you tell socket.io to bin to the ssl server
11:58 < geNAZt> so spawning its own would be wrong
11:58 < darrenlooby> Indeed it would
12:01 < darrenlooby> No idea why it's doing that
12:01 < darrenlooby> I've cut my code right to the bone
12:02 < geNAZt> welll i look at the socket.io code to find why it is doing that
12:03 < geNAZt> https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io/blob/0.9/lib/socket.io.js#L54-L57
12:03 < geNAZt> so the only case where socket.io would use a port 80 http server is when you dont give a server into it
12:04 < geNAZt> maybe you have a typo ? or try console.log(httpsserver); between the two lines
12:08 < darrenlooby> Okay, so I've got this... var server = https.createServer(options, app).listen(443); = undefined
12:09 < geNAZt> you have checked this ?
12:09 < darrenlooby> I've put it through console.log(server)
12:09 < darrenlooby> And it prints out undefined
12:10 < geNAZt> can you do a log out for https ?
12:14 < darrenlooby> https outputs... I'll gist it
12:14 < darrenlooby> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5023596
12:15 < geNAZt> console.log(https.createServer(options));
12:15 < geNAZt> what does that print ?
12:21 < darrenlooby> returns undefined
12:23 < geNAZt> well thats bad
12:23 < darrenlooby> Indeed lol
12:23 < geNAZt> fill an issue for this ?
12:24 < darrenlooby> I've not done yet, I'll file one later
12:24 < darrenlooby> Going to go spend some time with the kids
12:24 < darrenlooby> Thanks for your help so far
12:24 < geNAZt> np
12:26 < finishingmove> I'M A RAINBOW TOO
12:27 < yawnt> i'm a rainbow hunter
12:37 < nickoe> Is this bad? http://dpaste.com/985204/   I am trying to build v0.6.21
12:53 < dmcaodha> Anyone having socket hang-up troubles with Express?
12:53 < nikentic> Same. 
12:55 < [Fudge]> I need to read a 4GB+ file using Node, however the process runs out of memory
12:55 < [Fudge]> any solution?
12:56 < Sven_vB> read it in chunks?
12:56 < Sven_vB> ans process in chunks, if possible
12:56 < geNAZt> streams ?
12:56 < [Fudge]> I'll show you how I'm doing it currently
12:57 < [Fudge]> the thing is, I need to use xml2js on it
12:57 < geNAZt> no
12:57 < Stilo> someone work with backbone.js here?
12:57 < geNAZt> then you do it wrong :D
12:57 < [Fudge]> it seems to read it, then when it's getting parsed it runs out of memory
12:57 < [Fudge]> it's stored in a buffer at first
12:57 < nikentic> What are the actual advantages of using MongoDB over MySQL?
12:57 < [Fudge]> nikentic: it depends on what data you're working with
12:57 < geNAZt> well nodejs / v8 has a memory heap limit of ~1.4 Gb
12:57 < nikentic> I see MongoDB all over the place (used in Node) that is
12:57 < geNAZt> so it never would work
12:58 < [Fudge]> geNAZt: is there a way of increasing that limit at runtime?
12:58 < geNAZt> no and it shouldnt be
12:58 < geNAZt> nodejs has streaming data
12:58 < geNAZt> and i dont think that you need 4 gb in memory
12:58 < geNAZt> and if you need maybe you should think of a database or key value store
12:58 < nikentic> [Fudge]: I'm just using a single collection in MongoDB atm, with 2 rows of text
12:58 < nikentic> simple stuff
12:59 < [Fudge]> that's what I'm going to do geNAZt 
12:59 < [Fudge]> that's what the script is for
12:59 < [Fudge]> but the file is an XML
12:59 < geNAZt> if you stream contents and parse them on the go you never run out of memory
12:59 < geNAZt> well whats the problem with xml ?
12:59 < geNAZt> you only need a xml parser that can parse from streams
13:00 < [Fudge]> I want to convert it to a javascript object then add it to my database :P
13:00 < [Fudge]> well
13:00 < [Fudge]> how would I go about doing that?
13:00 < geNAZt> https://github.com/assistunion/xml-stream
13:00 < geNAZt> that seems to do it for you
13:01 < [Fudge]> mm
13:01 < [Fudge]> I'll try it out
13:02 < [Fudge]> var file = fs.createReadStream("the.xml");
13:02 < [Fudge]> file.on("data", function(data) {xml += data});
13:02 < [Fudge]> geNAZt^
13:02 < [Fudge]> is how I'm reading it
13:02 < geNAZt> the worst you can do :D
13:02 < [Fudge]> nvm the data evebt though
13:02 < [Fudge]> event*
13:13 < nikentic> I might as well swap over to MySQL, simply because MongoDB has such gimicky ways to get a random record
13:14 < geNAZt> nikentic: db.yourCollection.find().limit(-1).skip(yourRandomNumber).next().  ?
13:45 < nikentic> geNAZt: it's not very efficient with many records
13:46 < geNAZt> thats true
13:46 < geNAZt> but with many records mongodb is slow in all things
13:49 < nikentic> I thought that's where mongoDB is shining? with scaleability and such
13:49 < geNAZt> the only thing mongodb does good is storing data in json format
13:50 < geNAZt> if you want to now more about nosql vs sql you can look this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRoy6I4gKWU
13:50 < geNAZt> its about backend databases on app engine
13:51 < geNAZt> which use cases they cover and what they in general cover
13:51 < geNAZt> and nosql / mongo / couch is good for storing much data, if you dont bother about read delay
13:53 < nikentic> hmm
13:54 < nikentic> The thing I am doing is that I am picking a random record on each page refresh, and showing it as text
13:54 < nikentic> I am not sure how to do it efficiently, using angular and express
13:54 < geNAZt> append a random number to the records ?
13:55 < geNAZt> and then db.collection.find({random: { $gt: <randomnumber> }}).limit(1);
13:55 < nikentic> hmm?
13:55 < geNAZt> ?
13:55 < nikentic> hmm, I suppose.
13:55 < geNAZt> then you can index the number
13:56 < geNAZt> which will give a little performance
13:56 < nikentic> But I suppose the performance increase isn't really noticeable in a small environment?
13:56 < geNAZt> well that depends on "small"
13:57 < nikentic> compared with the skip()
13:57 < nikentic> It'll be <5k records
13:58 < geNAZt> well i would use the random number thing
13:58 < geNAZt> since the skip can cost much time
13:58 < geNAZt> and can cause race conditions
13:59 < geNAZt> the bigger the data set the bigger the issues
13:59 <@Nexxy> mo' data mo' prollemz
14:00 < nikentic> It's fun learning new stuff with MongoDB and Angular. Started with it yesterday
14:00 < geNAZt> yes it should be easy
14:01 < geNAZt> since you dont need to parse the sql protocol into javascript
14:01 < fkm> Hi there. I have a problem with my node.js application. If I should rather be asking in the express or jade channel, please tell. The problem: I would like to pass a single row from the database to the template, but somehow the framework tells me, that the variable is not defined. Although from my understanding, I did everything correctly.
14:01 < fkm> Here's the code and error: http://dpaste.com/986359/
14:02 < nikentic> Are you sure the query is returning the correct results?
14:02 < geNAZt> well you have a big injection bug
14:03 < fkm> nikentic: Yes. I did a console.log and the object looks just fine.
14:03 < nikentic> I haven't used Jade much, but shouldn't event.title be inside #{}?
14:05 < fkm> As I understand it, the equal sign after the h2 does the trick. But I wasn't sure so I tried with "h2 #{event.title}" and it didn't work either :-(
14:06 < fkm> http://dpaste.com/986404/
14:06 < fkm> ^ The object
14:07 < fkm> Is there a Jade channel?
14:08 < geNAZt> why jade ? :D
14:09 < nikentic> Templating ftw
14:09 < geNAZt> swig ftw or eja
14:09 < geNAZt> ejs*
14:09 < geNAZt> jade is pain
14:09 < geNAZt> pure pain
14:09 < Edy> ejs +1
14:09 < Kakera> I like jade
14:09 < nikentic> Same
14:11 < nikentic> Em, any way to prevent NodeJS from crashing when I spam refreshes when browsing?
14:11 < nikentic> :P
14:11 < geNAZt> well i love swig since i used the symfony2 framework in php
14:11 < geNAZt> nikentic: look a toobusy
14:12 < geNAZt> https://github.com/lloyd/node-toobusy
14:12 < nikentic> Well why is it crashing from me just holding down f5?
14:12 < geNAZt> maybe the queue is full and your server is slowwwwwww
14:13 < geNAZt> but it shouldnt crash than either
14:13 < geNAZt> then*
14:13 < nikentic> Socket hangup
14:15 < geNAZt> well thats not a bug
14:16 < geNAZt> its an error you should handle :D
14:16 < nikentic> That's why I asked how I should prevent it ;)
14:17 < geNAZt> maybe listen to the clientError event from the http server is enough
14:25 < nikentic> I'm using express, I am trying to do what you said but it's never triggering the event :S
14:26 < nikentic> must be doing something wrong
14:27 < geNAZt> do you have an error message with line number and filename ?
14:27 < nikentic> yeah
14:28 < geNAZt> which is it ?
14:28 < nikentic> Events.js:71 throw arguments[1]; // Unhandled 'error' event
14:29 < geNAZt> okay bind an error listener to http server
14:29 < geNAZt> then it should be okay
14:31 < DarkArgon> do you make db querys in your req nikentic?
14:32 < nikentic> I do
14:32 < DarkArgon> do you react to errors? if(err) return next(err); for example
14:33 < nikentic> I do not
14:34 < nikentic> oh, it's mongo that is throwing it
14:34 < nikentic> I see
14:34 < DarkArgon> :D
14:34 < geNAZt> lol mongo can cause socket hangups ?
14:34 < nikentic> apparently
14:35 < nikentic> how should I catch the error? First time doing this kind of stuff.
14:37 < DarkArgon> callbackFromMongo(err, result){ if(err) return next(err); }
14:38 < denysonique> https://gist.github.com/denysonique/76f5b6b9c9a27871fb0c
14:38 < denysonique> gives me: { [Error: incorrect header check] errno: -3, code: 'Z_DATA_ERROR' }
14:39 < denysonique> if I do curl http://url | gunzip -- this works fine
14:39 < nikentic> It points me to the res.json call. hmm
14:41 < DarkArgon> what points you to res.json?
14:41 < nikentic> at exports.posts:40:17
14:41 < nikentic> which is res.json
14:42 < DarkArgon> do you catch the error from mongo?
14:43 < DarkArgon> or do you handle it. (because its not throwing)
14:45 < nikentic> process.on('uncaughtException', function(err) {}); fixed it
14:45 < nikentic> not sure if I should solve it that way
14:45 < DarkArgon> not good
14:48 < nikentic> well it works.
14:49 < DarkArgon> thats not fixed
14:49 < DarkArgon> your just ignoring every error
14:49 < nikentic> I assume it's my mongo server that can't handle all the requests
14:49 < nikentic> yeah I know
14:50 < DarkArgon> do you use mongoose or the native mongodb driver?
14:50 < nikentic> native
14:50 <@Nexxy> nikentic, where is the error originating?
14:50 <@Nexxy> nikentic, also what version of node are you using?
14:51 < nikentic> 0.8.20
14:51 < nikentic> http://i.imgur.com/ChpDeqw.png
14:51 < DarkArgon> ahh windows 8
14:52 < nikentic> does it cause a problem?
14:53 <@Nexxy> nikentic, are you binding an error handler to your response object?
14:53 < nikentic> Nexxy: would if I knew how
14:53 <@Nexxy> res.on('error', function(err) { // do something w/ err });
14:54 < nikentic> where would I put that?
14:54 < spion> hey guys. one more star on http://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=2355 and it will be come the 2nd most starred issue in v8.
14:54 <@Nexxy> nikentic, anywhere you're handling requests
14:56 < nikentic> socket hang up code: 'ECONNRESET'
14:57 < DarkArgon> nikentic, just post a gist/pastebin of your mongo query
14:57 < nikentic> be ready for shitty code then. heh..
14:58 < DarkArgon> lol
14:58 < nikentic> I kind of have no idea what I am doing, just trying to make something work.. :P
14:58 < nikentic> http://pastebin.com/cLdLLkeH
14:59 < DarkArgon> line 1
14:59 < DarkArgon> exports.posts = function (req, res, next) {
14:59 < spion> if implemented it would give us JSON.stringify(yield collection.findOne.bind(collection, {id: blah})) and more.
15:00  * spion lobbies for moar votes xD
15:07 < nikentic> hmm
15:08 < DarkArgon> line 9. forgot to handle the "error1"
15:16 < nikentic> Ah well, I'll fix that later when I understand it better
15:16 < joelmob> is there any point in minifying .js files thats runned by node
15:16 < nikentic> i am handling all the errors afaik
15:18 < DarkArgon> just put return next(error1); after line 9
15:18 < nikentic> I have
15:18 < nikentic> same thing
15:19 < DarkArgon> and replace line 1 with exports.posts = function (req, res, next) {
15:19 < nikentic> yup, same thing
15:24 < DarkArgon> do you get the error on every request?
15:24 < nikentic> nonon
15:24 < nikentic> I don't even get it if I refresh the page as fast as I can
15:24 < nikentic> only if I literally hold f5 down
15:30 <@Nexxy> what is good for webaudio api?
15:30 <@Nexxy> mbalho, ?
15:35 < MI6> joyent/libuv: Ben Noordhuis threadpool-rework * c7d53e2 : unix: make threadpool spiffier (+4 more commits) - http://git.io/NLha_w
15:36 <@Nexxy> omg, plx 2 halp
15:40 < gnarf> Nexxy: like for what?
15:40 < pats_Toms> Nexxy, what really you need?
15:41 < gnarf> http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/intro/ ? or are you like looking for an abstraction for some part of it Nexxy?
15:42 < pats_Toms> Nexxy, check soundmanager2
15:43 < jetienne> webaudio.js
15:43 < jetienne> http://jeromeetienne.github.com/webaudio.js/
15:43 <@Nexxy> cool
15:43 < jetienne> http://jeromeetienne.github.com/webaudio.js/examples/histotquery.html
15:43 <@Nexxy> jetienne, I think this is what I want! thank you :D
15:43 <@Nexxy> gnarf, pats_Toms thank you!
15:44 < gnarf> have you seen the github song btw?
15:44 < gnarf> i figure everyone has by now
15:44 < gnarf> i saw like 40 retweets
15:46 <@Nexxy> gnarf, yeah haha
15:51 < gnarf> completely off topic, but has anyone here ever had a layover in heathrow terminal 3
15:51 < gnarf> this has been the worst airport experience ever... this place sucks
15:52 < gnarf> also, anyone planning on TXJS?
15:58 < hangtwenty> Does anybody have experience with Jade, LaTex, TeXML, XML, and/or XLST? Want to bounce an idea off of you if so :P
15:59 < hangtwenty> not trying to recruit any efforts, just looking to brainstorm a little. Basically, I want to be able to write LaTeX semantics with Jade syntax.
16:01 < JmZ> for what reason would fs.createReadStream('somefile').pipe(fs.createWriteStream('anotherfile')) hang?
16:01 < JmZ> if i create them separately and don't pipe, just to check they aren't throwing errors, they work fine
16:04 < JmZ> even if i add a callback to each one's error event, there are no errors. but it hangs 
16:48 < nikentic> Anyone who can give suggestions why my app crashes when I refresh the page consantly (holding f5)?
16:49 < nikentic> using express & mongodb
16:49 < DarkArgon> mongodb also running on windows?
16:49 < nikentic> yeah
16:49 < nikentic> same comp
16:50 < nikentic> Is it a problem?
16:51 < pats_Toms> hmm, I have page with the same setup, I will test how it goes for me
16:51 < DarkArgon> i don't wanna bash windows, but that probably won't happen on linux
16:52 < DarkArgon> still you should handle that error
16:52 < pats_Toms> works nice for me
16:52 < pats_Toms> instant response too
16:52 < pats_Toms> wow
16:52 < LordThumper> Hi, I am trying to install socket.io using "npm install socket.io" on my Windows 8 / VS2012 Environment
16:53 < LordThumper> I had to install "Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows Server 2008 and .NET Framework 3.5" to get vcbuild.exe, but that didn't work either.
16:53 < nikentic> http://nicentic.com:3000/ can someone of you hold f5 on this for me please? :P
16:53 < LordThumper> Is that because the vcbuild.exe installed is 32bit? My node.js is 64bit
16:53 < DarkArgon> i did nikentic 
16:53 < pats_Toms> nikentic, I am doing this now
16:54 < nikentic> okay it filled it with messages
16:54 < nikentic> but it doesn't crash
16:54 < nikentic> only when I do it locally
16:54 < nikentic> is it because I load the page instantly and mongodb can't handle it?
16:57 < DarkArgon> do you create a new mongodb connection on every request?
16:58 < nikentic> I do?
16:58 < nikentic> no.
17:08 < nikentic> let's try hosting it on heroku
17:53 < shaneeb> hi
17:53 < shaneeb> not sure if it is the right place, but what is the best option for pdf generation in node?
17:57 < shaneeb> anyone with any experience in pdf generation?
17:58 < Edy> we use mpdf
17:58 < Edy> (html to pdf with php)
17:59 < ajf> hmm
17:59 < ajf> Python has ReportLib
17:59 < ajf> I think there's something similar for node
18:04 < erichocean> hey, anyone know how to put a multi-byte Unicode character in a string literal? I'm trying to do U+1F4C5
18:05 < erichocean> "\u1F4C5" doesn't work o_0
18:06 < shaneeb> @Edy is there something to design the document rather than hand code it?
18:07 < erichocean> I also tried using the actual Unicode character in UTF-8
18:07 < Edy> shaneeb: nope
18:08 < shaneeb> Edy: hmm, how do u do it in mpdf?
18:09 < shaneeb> @Edy: manual calculation?
18:10 < Edy> i hand code my html templates for mpdf
18:12 < shaneeb> hmm interesting...
18:12 < shaneeb> is there any way i could let my users customize the templates?
18:13 < shaneeb> like the layout and everything?
18:13 < Edy> let them upload their html
18:16 < shaneeb> hmm that could work, thanks :)
18:30 < StPiere> whats the best way to share the user session between node.js and php/python/perl ?
18:31 < ganzuul> A database?
18:32 < lohkey> yeah, i usually opt for memcache or redis for that
18:32 < StPiere> what is redis ?
18:32 < lohkey> it's an in memory data structure server, like memcache on steroids
18:32 < monkeynipples> Hi - anyone recommend anywhere I can find freelance nodejs dev's ?
18:33 < StPiere> i see :) ... memcache sounds like a good option
18:33 < lohkey> monkeynipples: how many billable hours is said project?
18:33 < StPiere> thanks
18:33 < paulkon> monkeynipples... I'm impressed with the name
18:34 < paulkon> quite original
18:34 < monkeynipples> lohkey: I'd say probably 2 weeks - month project 
18:34 < monkeynipples> thanks paulkon
18:35 < monkeynipples> at least for first phase
18:36 < lohkey> monkeynipples: full time or part time?
18:37 < monkeynipples> either, as long as the work gets done, i'm not so focused on time spent, just output
18:37 < lohkey> is it a new project or an existing code base?
18:38 < lohkey> and are the any other people working on it?
18:38 < monkeynipples> new, does involve some 3rd party libs - and no, no one else is currently working on it

18:43 < ganzuul> Any tips for getting really low latency communication with an android device over local wifi? I'd like to try my hand at making a game controller.
18:43 < ganzuul> A number I saw while googling for this was 200ms, but that's a bit high.
18:45 < jrajav> ganzuul: Rather than the network latency, which will be low enough not to matter for a home network, I would worry about the latency of the capacitive touchscreen
18:45 < jrajav> ganzuul: The technology used in current phones and tablets produces a delay of >=100ms
18:46 < jrajav> ganzuul: The number you saw probably factored that in along with worst-case network latency and processing
18:46 < ganzuul> jrajav: Actually the display would be that of a PC, where the game runs in something like three.js.
18:46 < jrajav> No, I'm talking about input
18:46 < jrajav> Not rendering
18:46 < jrajav> You said you were making a controller
18:47 < ganzuul> Using the sensors. I should have said that...
18:47 < jrajav> Oh
18:47 < jrajav> I'd say it should be fine then. Certainly nowhere on the order of 200ms
18:48 < jrajav> Only way to know for sure is to profile it yourself
18:48 < ganzuul> I saw a guy on the mtbs VR enthusiast forum who came up with the idea of using a balance board as a game controller.
18:49 < ganzuul> And js is the only hammer I know... :D
18:49 < ganzuul> This --> http://www.mtbs3d.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=140&t=16515#p102198
18:51 < ganzuul> Well, better get me an android phone at last. :D
19:01 < ganzuul> Or not. Seems my Nokia N8 will work fine: https://github.com/wildabeast/phonegap-demo/blob/master/js/controller.js
19:07 < andrearossi> hi everybody, node.js noob here!
19:08 < ganzuul> Welcome. =)
19:08 < andrearossi> thanks! could anybody gimme a hand with a httpRequest issue I'm having?
19:09 < ganzuul> Just ask. Use https://gist.github.com/ for pasting code. If someone knows they're likely to answer.
19:12 < andrearossi> oh, okay! I'm writing a little API in node+express that should serve various applications, and let them talk together. Something like a proxy API. Now, as I'm registering apps in MongoDB, I want them to be identified by (in addition to obvious authentication) hostname of the incoming request. To test it while developing I created a little faker.js, that creates httpRequests, hijacking the Host header with the one passed by argv.
19:13 < andrearossi> the problem is that in the API I call Mongo to get the app with that hostname, and as soon as mongo gives me back the app, I send back...
19:13 < andrearossi> res.send(200, format("Hey, you are %s! Welcome!", app.name));
19:13 < andrearossi> but…on the other side...
19:13 < andrearossi> problem with request: socket hang up
19:14 < blocky97> hi i'm a noob to node.js …and i'm making my first app…. When i do apps for client side i usually wrap everything in an anonymous function i.e. (function(){
19:14 < blocky97>     "use strict";
19:14 < [Fudge]> .
19:14 < blocky97> })()
19:14 < blocky97> should i do that for my classes in node? …the samples don't seem like they do it like that.
19:14 < [Fudge]> no
19:14 < [Fudge]> you don't need to
19:15 < geNAZt> its bad for debugging
19:15 < geNAZt> since anonym function appear anonym in stacks
19:15 < darrenlooby> Does anyone have any ideas why a script would work on a remove server, and not locally? Using the same node js version? I'm using socket.io and the static file 404'd
19:15 < blocky97> So then is everything just scoped to the file?
19:15 < geNAZt> yes
19:16 < geNAZt> nodejs has no "global" like a browser does
19:16 < ganzuul> andrearossi: I can't give you a direct answer. I'm new to node as well, however, "Use the -v form to control the level of verbosity by including the option multiple times, (e.g. -vvvvv.)" says the mongo manual.
19:16 < blocky97> ahh ok cool! thanks a bunch :)
19:17 < andrearossi> looks like the httpRequest doesn't want to wait for the mongo callback, and closes the connection immediately. trying the same thing via browser works like a charm, but I cannot hijack the Host header via Chrome...
19:18 < ganzuul> Are you using SSL?
19:18 < andrearossi> ganzuul: nope
19:20 < ganzuul> Are you using long polling in faker.js?
19:21 < andrearossi> ganzuul: hum, no. the code looks very simple. Just a basic httpRequest.
19:22 < ganzuul> Those close when completed. - No waiting. You are probably looking for long polling. :)
19:22 < andrearossi> well, solved. 
19:22 < andrearossi> now that's crazy!
19:23 < ganzuul> oh?
19:23 < andrearossi> I was just using the pasted code from the node api doc, as it was everything I needed. And I just left the req.write('data\n'); bit, as I was thinking it was harmless.
19:23 < andrearossi> Now I just removed it. Working perfectly.
19:24 < andrearossi> don't ask me why.. :D
19:27 < ganzuul> I see 'data', 'end' and 'close' in the node api, but no 'write'...
19:28 < ganzuul> Might be deprecated?
19:30 < ganzuul> nm, found
19:42 < LordThumper> Did anyone install nodejs on Win8?
20:06 < Kakera> are there any libraries that use libuv?
20:06 < Kakera> C libraries I mean
20:06 < Kakera> not bindings to other languages
20:08 < bnoordhuis> Kakera: probably. why do you ask?
20:09 < Kakera> bnoordhuis, to see how they implemented custom events and functions
20:11 < bnoordhuis> Kakera: not sure what you mean by that
20:12 < Kakera> bnoordhuis, in Node.js you just create a class that inherits EventEmitter. What's the libuv way?
20:14 < bnoordhuis> Kakera: you specify a callback
20:14 < bnoordhuis> e.g. uv_read_start(handle, alloc_cb, read_cb)
20:14 < Kakera> bnoordhuis, a callback that listens to every event?
20:16 < bnoordhuis> Kakera: 'every event' as in 'process wide'? no
20:16 < Kakera> no, as in every event my library would emit
20:16 < bnoordhuis> i'm not sure i follow
20:16 < Kakera> think an IRC library
20:17 < bnoordhuis> libuv works like this: you create a handle, register one or more callbacks, whenever something interesting happens, libuv calls you
20:17 < Kakera> it would have events like "message" "mode" etc
20:18 < Gambit-> hey bnoordhuis, I have traffic passing :)
20:18 < bnoordhuis> Gambit-: yeah? congratulations :)
20:18 < darrenlooby> I've decided to completely remove nodejs from my laptop and start again. It seems that I've littered my machine with different node installs... and I've removed most - but, can't find the rest. How do I find out where node is still installed?
20:18 < Kakera> bnoordhuis, I'm not talking about using libuv directly, but about writing a library that uses libuv
20:19 < Gambit-> bnoordhuis, ended up performing deep fuckery on libuv to just implement the API rather than trying to patch it in at a lower level.  Not sure what that will do to my compatibility with other source-code modules.
20:19 < Gambit-> Kakera, I assume you're writing a node.js library, right?
20:20 < Kakera> no, libuv
20:20 < Kakera> in node.js you just inherit EventEmitter and export your class
20:20 < Gambit-> oh, no offense to bnoordhuis et al, but libuv by itself isn't something I'd bring elsewhere.
20:22 < robinson_k> hrm i spotted a bug in my pull request. what is best practice here: close it, rebase and open another pull request or just adding the fix as commit?
20:22 < niggler> robinson_k if you are using github just add changes and it should automatically update thep ull request
20:23 < robinson_k> niggler: yeah but doesn't it look sloppy?
20:23 < bnoordhuis> robinson_k: squash and force push it
20:23 < niggler> yeah you should squash your commits to whatever makes sense
20:28 < robinson_k> thanks alot for your advice
20:29 < thisissam> hello everybody
20:35 < jasper^off> hej guys, I'm getting the following error: Error: targetStart out of bounds
20:36 < jasper^off> http://paste.ubuntu.com/5562824/
20:36 < jasper^off> does that look familiour to anyone?
20:36 < bnoordhuis> jasper^off: you're calling buffer.copy() with a bad arg
20:37 < jasper^off> bnoordhuis I'm not
20:37 < jasper^off> I'm only using node-static
20:38 < bnoordhuis> jasper^off: okay. then node-static is calling buffer.copy() with a bad arg
20:38 < jasper^off> hmm
20:38 < jasper^off> that's messed up then
20:53 < joocebocks> Hi all, I have a problem upload a binary file - express 'bodyParser' is giving me a parsing exception. I think I know what is malformed request is, but it's being produced by a vendor I'm using.  I can't get rid of them just now and they are unresponsive, so I'm looking to code around their problem on the server side.  Can anyone recommend some way to hire someone to help me solve this?
20:56 < Anton____> Hi all.
20:56 < Anton____> Somebody known about implementation threads in node.js ?
20:57 < nkohari> what do you mean by "implementation threads"?
20:57 < gkatsev> webworkers? fibers? green threads?
20:57 < Anton____> implement multiple copy of V8 ScriptEngine in one process
20:58 < Anton____> green threads
20:58 < nkohari> look at node-fibers for a similar idea
20:58 < Anton____> im need some code, but somebody code may lock V8 EventLoop - I'm need manage it
20:58 < Anton____> Im try using a threads_a_gogo - but thread.destroy dont destroy infinite code in thread
20:58 < nkohari> if you're running third-party code, you may want to use a sandbox via the vm module instead
20:58 < gkatsev> there is node-fibers for fibers, which is similar to green threads.
20:59 < Anton____> node-fibers use on V8 engine
20:59 < Anton____> then - if loop will been locked - all others fibers will be locked too
20:59 < Anton____> Im need simple - multiple instance of V8 in one process (spawn don't approve)
21:00 < nkohari> http://nodejs.org/api/vm.html
21:00 < gkatsev> Anton____: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/modules#wiki-async-flow-fibers choose a module from here
21:00 < carpii> how can i troubleshoot an intermittent connection using request.js? Sometimes its taking 5 seconds to respond, despite it being on a lan and it does appear to be some node issue rather than network or latency
21:00 < nkohari> i don't think you really want threads Anton____ 
21:00 < nkohari> it's not really a concurrency problem
21:00 < Anton____> nkohari, VM module use ONE context - then, if I launch in VM while(true) { } - its lock ALL process
21:01 < lyaunzbe> hey guys, I have a general js question (##js is too busy). How do I manipulate a cloned array without altering the original? http://pastebin.com/xZTzpsMJ
21:01 < Anton____> Im need only 4 function create/start/stop/eval for thread
21:01 < nkohari> in that case, you probably just want to shell out another node process to run the third-party code and then watch it
21:02 < lyaunzbe> In that paste, Im doing obj.sort.slice() to create a clone of obj.sort, but in the end, obj.sort gets altered.
21:02 < lyaunzbe> obj.sort.slice(0)*
21:02 < gkatsev> lyaunzbe: you want obj.slice.sort instead
21:02 < lyaunzbe> gkatsev, the name of the array is obj.sort 
21:02 < gkatsev> oh
21:02 < nkohari> yeah, Array.sort() will mutate the array itself
21:03 < nkohari> oh.
21:03 < gkatsev> nkohari: lol
21:03 < lyaunzbe> ya, thats really a bad name for the array...
21:03 < Anton____> in this capter https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/modules#wiki-javascript-threads only one solution

21:04 < nkohari> Anton____: you're probably going to want to run another node process
21:05 < Anton____> i'm need launch about 100-150 tasks %)
21:05 < nkohari> lyaunzbe: so, you're wondering why the items in obj.sort are getting obj.sort.items set to empty arrays?
21:05 < nkohari> er, i should say, why the items in obj.sort are getting their item properties set to empty arrays
21:05 < Anton____> if you try spawn 100-150 instance of node - you system will be slowdown
21:06 < nkohari> Anton____: i don't know what you're trying to do but there's a reason the halting problem is unsolvable
21:06 < lyaunzbe> nkohari: yes, I want to be able to manipulate limit without altering obj.sort at all
21:06 < OliverJAsh> Given this data and query, I need a filter function that will match http://jsbin.com/umeros/1/edit?javascript,console,live
21:06 < OliverJAsh> Can anyone help me refactor that filter function to work?
21:06 < nkohari> lyaunzbe: slice() is only going to copy the array itself, not the members of the array
21:06 < nkohari> for that you'd need some kind of deep copy
21:06 < nkohari> since the array only contains references to the objects
21:07 < lyaunzbe> nkohari: Okay, I read about that but I wasn't sure that it applied to my issue. Do you know of the best way to make a deep copy? Underscore's clone seems to be shallow as well...
21:08 < lyaunzbe> ahh so basically limit.items is actually a reference to obj.sort.items
21:08 < nkohari> if obj.sort is an array
21:08 < nkohari> you're creating a new array by calling slice(0)
21:08 < nkohari> which contains the same references
21:09 < nkohari> then you're iterating over the copy
21:09 < nkohari> and altering the references
21:09 < nkohari> but since they're the same references, you're changing the objects in both arrays
21:11 < lyaunzbe> any suggestions on how I would achieve a deep clone?
21:11 < nkohari> i'm sure there's a library that's implemented it
21:11 < Anton____> nkohari, i'm have compute system - this system have plugins. plugins write from 3rd party person. system must run this pluings per request (about 10-20 request per minute). some plugins may slowdown system or break it. now plugins work in separate process - but plugins is TOO much (more 100) - Im think so need 1 thread = 1 plugins
21:12 < nkohari> Anton____: you might try creating a job queue with a pool of worker processes
21:12 < Anton____> Im try find solution - HOWTO create multiple thread in ONE node.js instance
21:12 < Anton____> queue already work for request
21:12 < nkohari> do you need to run all 100 plugins for every request?
21:13 < Anton____> for plugins its impossible as architecture
21:13 < Anton____> yes
21:13 < Anton____> 1 plugins work about 0.3-0.5sec
21:14 < Anton____> If im run it in queue it will be about 0.4x100 = 40sec delay
21:14 < Anton____> now it work as setTimeout launch - and delay about 2-4sec
21:14 < Anton____> or smaller
21:15 < nkohari> what if you had a pool of 5-10 worker processes that would execute the plugins as necessary and return the values back to the master process
21:16 < nkohari> then the master could watch the workers and if it didn't get return values rapidly it would assume a plugin had hung, and kill it and respawn
21:16 < nkohari> i just don't think you're going to solve the problem through threading
21:17 < nkohari> and if threads are the answer, node isn't the best platform for it, since there's no native thread implementation
21:20 < gurjeet> Is it possible to launch Jasmine tests from within another JS file? Like this Jakefile does with nodeunit : https://github.com/jamesshore/lets_code_javascript/blob/episode9/jakefile.js
21:21 < gurjeet> .. or do it with jasmine-node instead..
21:29 < Anton____> maybe jasmine-node it's solution. thx. :)
21:30 < nkohari> i might be wrong, but i don't think gurjeet meant that as an answer to your question
21:30 < booyaa> anyone else getting peerDependencies errors on node v0.8.20 when trying to do npm install -g express?
21:31 < gurjeet> Anton___:  nkohari is correct
21:31 < Anton____> thx.
21:31 < Anton____> booyaa, express version?
21:32 < booyaa> Anton____: not sure how do i tell?
21:33 < booyaa> 3.1.0 according to express -V
21:33 < carpii> could someone critique a very simple module wrapper ive done please? Im not sure if its the right way to go about it… http://pastie.org/6330170
21:33 < carpii> just trying to encapsulate buffered-writer and add some helper methods
21:34 < nkohari> looks fine structurally
21:34 < bnoordhuis> carpii: why module.exports.ChatLogger instead of exports.ChatLogger?
21:34 < nkohari> you'd actually want module.exports = Chatlogger
21:34 < nkohari> most likely
21:34 < bnoordhuis> btw, i usually put all my exports at the top of the file, makes it easy to see what's exported
21:34 < nkohari> well, it depends on if you want people to do:
21:34 < gluxon> carpii: I would be consistent with my indent style, but that's picky.
21:34 < nkohari> Chatlogger = require("chatlogger");
21:35 < nkohari> er, with var at the beginning ;)
21:35 < nkohari> or var Chatlogger = require("chatlogger").Chatlogger;
21:35 < nkohari> for the former, use module.exports = Chatlogger
21:35 < nkohari> for the latter, use exports.Chatlogger = Chatlogger
21:35 < bnoordhuis> module.exports = ChatLogger would override module.version
21:35 < carpii> i forgot to add my client code, sorry. one sec
21:36 < hallas> no reason to do module.exports.chatlogger
21:36 < hallas> ever
21:36 < carpii> client code is at bottom, this is how id liekt o use the object-- http://pastie.org/6330197
21:37 < carpii> ok hallas, i was just following a tute. what are my options?
21:37 < hallas> it seems what you want is module.exports = ChatLogger
21:37 < nkohari> typically if you want to export a single class you use module.exports = TheClassName
21:38 < carpii> and this will let me instantiate the class mutliple times?   
21:38 < nkohari> if you want to export more than one function or class, you do exports.TheClassName = TheClassName, etc.
21:38 < MI6> joyent/libuv: Ben Noordhuis threadpool-rework * 6fba593 : test: remove 'is root?' check  I debug tests regularly as root (because d (+4 more commits) - http://git.io/gsVl7A
21:38 < nkohari> either way will do that, yeah
21:38 < carpii> ok thanks
21:38 < nkohari> it's a subtle difference :)
21:38 < carpii> why do i sometimes see   module.exports = export = classname ?
21:38 < carpii> exports
21:38 < nkohari> people being confused and just doing both Just In Case(tm)
21:38 < nkohari> :)
21:38 < carpii> as in, what role does the local exports play?
21:39 < nkohari> none really
21:39 < carpii> ok, so i can ignore local exports
21:39 < nkohari> and you can't do exports = Something in order to export the class
21:39 < hallas> shorthand for module.exports
21:39 < nkohari> it's sort of shorthand but it isn't
21:39 < nkohari> exports.Foo = Foo will export Foo
21:39 < nkohari> exports = Foo will not
21:39 < nkohari> (at least, that used to be how it worked)
21:39 < hallas> the members of exports are copied over to module.exports
21:40 < hallas> but not exports it self :) ?
21:40 < gluxon> exports = Foo seems kind of dangerous too.
21:40 < carpii> so if i have "module.exports = Chatlogger"  and my client code is still "chatlogs = require('./helpers/chatlogs.js')"    how do i then say   var catlogger = new chatlogs.Chatlogger() ?
21:41 < nkohari> if you did module.exports = Chatlogger
21:41 < nkohari> you would do var Chatlogger = require("./helpers/chatlogs.js")
21:41 < carpii> yes
21:41 < nkohari> and then var chatlogger = new Chatlogger()
21:41 < nkohari> if you did exports.Chatlogger = Chatlogger
21:41 < nkohari> you would do what you pasted in
21:41 < carpii> "chatlogger = new Chatlogger()" => Chatlogger is not defined
21:42 < mikolalysenko> is there anyway to trigger a garbage collect for benchmarking purposes?
21:42 < nkohari> mikolalysenko: if you run node with --expose-gc you can call gc()
21:42 < nkohari> or use memwatch
21:42 < nkohari> which is a pretty cool library
21:42 < carpii> this is my latest module source -- http://pastie.org/6330230
21:42 < nkohari> carpii: that seems fine, what's your client code look like?
21:43 < mikolalysenko> are there docs for --expose-gc?
21:43 < carpii> var chatlogs = require('./helpers/chatlogs.js'); var chatlogger = new Chatlogger();
21:44 < nkohari> mikolalysenko: sorry i don't know where it's documented offhand, but i'm sure there is :)
21:45 < nkohari> carpii: try this
21:45 < nkohari> var Chatlogger = require('./helpers/chatlogs.js');
21:45 < nkohari> var logger = new Chatlogger();
21:47 < OliverJAsh> If an NPM module has a file that is not it's main file, but I want to require it… do I have to provide a full file path?
21:47 < OliverJAsh> Or can I still use the NPM module name as an alias
21:48 < nkohari> i believe you can still use the npm module
21:48 < nkohari> but i might be wrong
21:48 < carpii> similar problem nkohari-- http://pastie.org/6330250   -- i used chatlogger_obj because logger conflicted already
21:48 < nkohari> the problem is on the first line
21:49 < nkohari> you're assigning the result of your require() statement to the chatlogs variable
21:49 < nkohari> not the Chatlogger variable
21:49 < nkohari> common.js is a little confusing if you're used to other packaging systems like java
21:49 < nkohari> because you assign the result of a require to a variable
21:50 < carpii> hm
21:51 < carpii> sorry nko, would it be possible to elaborate? 
21:51 < WarheadsSE> how to fix an oops w/ npm publish? Accidentally published to an apparently new account ... https://npmjs.org/package/kismet 
21:52 < bnoordhuis> WarheadsSE: unpublish?
21:56 < WarheadsSE> K, how do i fix my username, so that it publishes to my original?
22:26 < OliverJAsh> Sorry was just disconnected, don't know if anyone replied…
22:40 < carpii> is tehre a way to add a finaliser function which will always be excuted, even if I CTRL-C the server?
22:41 < nkohari> process.on("exit", function() { ... });
22:45 < carpii> thankyou
22:47 < damarusama> hi there, I am playing around with creating a cli app with node and came accross commander.js
22:47 < damarusama> it seems to do most of the work, but is a bit limited on documentation, on how to parse the args send to the app
22:47 < damarusama> anyone knows a nice library to use to create nice cli apps ?
22:52 < nkohari> optimist is nice if you just want argument parsing
22:53 < damarusama> hum that's seems sweet
22:55 < damarusama> I wonder if I can use it with the commander.js - since the help function is quite sweet in commander..
22:55 < damarusama> thanks!
22:55 < nkohari> sure
23:13 < carpii> anyone know of a php library which emulates socket.io's protocol for stress testing purposes ?
23:15 < mscdex> carpii: "php socket.io protocol" gives as the first link: https://github.com/wisembly/elephant.io
23:15 < carpii> thanks, my search terms were screwy :(
