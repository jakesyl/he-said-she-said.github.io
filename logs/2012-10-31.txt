00:01 < kanyl> How about a kickstarter to register a ".js" TLD? Just because http://node.js/ would be a pretty neat domain name.
00:01 < kanyl> It's only like $200k
00:01 < Youdaman> i'll take 2
00:01 < TooTallNate> kanyl: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4020210
00:02 < kanyl> TooTallNate: epic
00:02 < dscape> kanyl: https://github.com/ozten/TLD.js
00:03 < Industrial> https://github.com/wearefractal/status this is nuts
00:03 < Youdaman> dscape: thanks, signed.
00:03 < kanyl> Signed!
00:04 < dscape> isaacs: yt?
00:04 < dscape> tried your tar example
00:04 < dscape> but going back to using files cause couldnt get it to work
00:04 < dscape> https://gist.github.com/6be9175d2396fb917680
00:05 < d4rklit3> substack , are you around?
00:05 < mscdex> booo coffeescript!
00:05 < Youdaman> mscdex: feel the love
00:05 < d4rklit3> how come b.bundle() does not throw an exception if something is wrong?
00:05 < d4rklit3> mscdex coffeescript is great
00:05 < kanyl> Coffescript looks awesome ;O
00:05 < d4rklit3> it gave me a new lease on js development
00:06 < d4rklit3> being a former flash guy
00:06 < SomeoneWeird> coffeescript is -> that way
00:06 < d4rklit3> or => that way
00:06 < mscdex> i'm not sure which is worse, flash or coffeescript
00:06 < d4rklit3> mscdex, explain yourself
00:06 < d4rklit3> so clearly you hate javascript too
00:06 < blazes816> not sure which is worse dead puppies or javascript
00:06 < SomeoneWeird> mscdex, they're as bad as eachother
00:06 < TooTallNate> kanyl: Youdaman: frankly i think the hype kinda died down on those kickstarter projects
00:06 < mscdex> no, javascript is awesome :-D
00:07 < d4rklit3> ok..
00:07 < d4rklit3> coffeescript is javascript
00:07 < d4rklit3> it has all functionalities
00:07 < d4rklit3> of js
00:07 < mscdex> heh...
00:07 < d4rklit3> just different syntax
00:07 < d4rklit3> what can u do in js that you can't do in coffee?
00:07 < mscdex> sane, familiar syntax :>
00:07 < TooTallNate> the "bad stuff" :p
00:07 < SomeoneWeird> it's not that
00:07 < SomeoneWeird> lol
00:07 < TooTallNate> in quotes
00:07 < Youdaman> TooTallNate: +1
00:07 < d4rklit3> its a matter of preference 
00:08 < kanyl> $200k isn't even that much. I mean, it's alot, but it's not crazy much. Is it even possible to register TLDs? Why aren't people doing it?
00:08 < TooTallNate> kanyl: i think the real problem is that you need to be like a real country or something
00:08 < d4rklit3> lets say you are used to writing server code in something other than js
00:08 < d4rklit3> say.. o i dont know
00:08 < kanyl> The only one I know of is .xxx... Google should get one, and every rich person.
00:08 < d4rklit3> C# or Php
00:08 < kanyl> TooTallNate: oohh.. like a country, or a porn company? :D
00:08 < bradleymeck> d4rklit3: determine wtf a comma is doing without reading to end of file
00:08 < blazes816> soon it'll be open you you'll be able to make whatever 'tld' you like
00:09 < aandy> kanyl: are you telling me there's no xxx country? :(
00:09 < d4rklit3> bradleymeck are you saying because you have to compile coffee into js before you can catch errors?
00:09 < kanyl> aandy: Germany?
00:09 < mscdex> www.nodejs.nodejs
00:09 < SomeoneWeird> cs is just shit
00:09 < bradleymeck> d4rklit3: commas in CS are grammatically ambiguous
00:10 < kanyl> wiki.node.js
00:10 < d4rklit3> its funny
00:10 < mscdex> nodejs.rul.es
00:10 < d4rklit3> to see people getting all pissed about CS
00:10 < d4rklit3> it makes me laugh
00:10 < kanyl> For the mac users: http://xn--ls8h.la/
00:10 < Youdaman> cs is fine. learn js, learn cs, use whichever you like. it's the libraries and tools that matter more than the language anyway. it's what you can do in your new shoes, not what colour they are.
00:10 < bradleymeck> d4rklit3: meh idc, just export to JS if you want it to have multi-lingual usage
00:11 < d4rklit3> what matters in the end result
00:11 < kanyl> Best domain ever. A poop-emoticon as tld would be pretty cool.
00:11 < d4rklit3> CS/JS isn't going to make anyone a better coder
00:11 < d4rklit3> if its easier for some1 to write in CS they should do it, because its more cost effective
00:11  * Youdaman hugs d4rklite3
00:11 < bradleymeck> Raynos: do you know a good way in new readable streams to read until a terminator, without massive amounts of read(1) or weird buffering with replays
00:12 < d4rklit3> :)
00:12 < Raynos> oh hi
00:12 < Raynos> bradleymeck: I was looking at that.
00:12 < EhevuTov> went from coding in Node/NPM and now back to C++. The tooling of C++ (and other languages) is horrible in comparison with the exception of Go
00:12 < d4rklit3> shit my system is pretty nice
00:12 < d4rklit3> node based coffee compiler
00:12 < d4rklit3> using browserify
00:12 < Raynos> bradleymeck: you can hack on stream._readableState.buffer
00:12 <@mbalho> bradleymeck: whats wrong with buffering a bit on the consuming stream?
00:12 < d4rklit3> its pretty sweeeet ccan just use require statements in all my classes.. just like AS :P
00:12 < bradleymeck> mbalho: thats a lot of allocations, a lot
00:13 < Raynos> bradleymeck: https://github.com/dominictarr/split/blob/master/index.js#L25
00:13 < Raynos> you can just read the entire thing
00:13 < Raynos> and keep the rest after the line terminator in memory
00:13 <@mbalho> like.. read a big chunk, once you have it in a buffer in your consuming stream find the terminator and splice 
00:13 <@mbalho> yea what raynos said
00:14 < rp123> hiya a qq about scoping. i have defined a variable in app.js but i can't access it inside one of the route methods
00:14 < bradleymeck> Raynos I guess but replays mean intermediate buffers, meh still trying to think of better way to integrate with internal buffer
00:15 < bradleymeck> guess ill just pull r and see how that goes
00:15 < Raynos> bradleymeck: yeah streams suffer from moving data from buffer to buffer to buffer
00:15 < Youdaman> rp123: link?
00:15 < Raynos> but thats because you need to handle backpressure
00:15 < dzajdband> rp123: code?
00:16 < Youdaman> rp123: http://pastebin.com/
00:16 < bradleymeck> Raynos yea, but reading until a terminator causing a need to rebuffer is not about backpressure, since you want to continue reading until X
00:16 < rp123> http://pastebin.com/5HxzifzQ
00:17 < rp123> sorry was doing that
00:17 <@mbalho> bradleymeck: since Buffer.slice in 0.8 it gets mitigated a bit though right
00:17 < bradleymeck> Raynos: anyway PR or GTFO
00:17 < bradleymeck> mbalho: a bit, but doing that on a 5mb ELF file blew node up around 30mb
00:18 <@mbalho> ah
00:18 < Youdaman> rp123: which line/variable?
00:20 < rp123> sorry look at http://pastebin.com/U4RYCduV (lines 15,16,17)
00:20 < rp123> and then line 29
00:20 < rp123> its a typical express 3.x app
00:21 <@isaacs> dscape: that's a bug.
00:21 <@isaacs> dscape: i see it
00:21 <@mbalho> you are a shaman! speaking to the past!
00:22 < chrisdickinson> substack: has there been any progress on the various efforts to support zlib through browserify?
00:23 < Industrial> rp123 aw and i took the time to look :(
00:25 < hendore> I'm not sure how this should really be done, kind of a design question here. I have 2 models (actor and movie), the movie model has an array of actors (the cast) and a method to add an actor. Should I also do the reverse on the actor such as an array of movies with a method to add the actor to a movie object? only problem is I can see this leading to a circular dependency 
00:25 < dscape> isaacs: is the workaround "unpack and repack" ?
00:26 < Youdaman> Industrial: guessing line 17 should be: var Post = app.db.model('Post', schema); // or something like this
00:26 < hendore> i guess the actor.addRole(movieObject, 'Actors main role in the movie') method could just do something like movieObject.addActor(this, role) and not store an array of movies within the actor object
00:26 < Industrial> Youdaman: meh, he left. but hes passing around vars that he can require locally.
00:27 < Industrial> hendore: your question is without context. what npm module are you talking about?
00:28 < Youdaman> Industrial: yeah he said his problem was line 29, and it seems his "Post" isn't what he thinks it is... probably should have asked him for the error message rather than relying upon his assumption that it was a scoping issue :L
00:29 < hendore> Industrial, no module, just general design question. Two basic models/objects that relate to each other
00:30 < harbhub> anyone know about a USB virus (trojan) that passes from one usb to another when they are both plugged in at the same time?
00:30 < harbhub> we just had that problem and now we cannot open our folders from within the usb drive
00:30 < hendore> Industrial, I'm just not sure if both objects should have an array of each other (movie object has an array of actors who starred in the movie, actor has an array of movies they have starred in)
00:30 < Youdaman> harbhub: can you open your folders when only one or the other is plugged in?
00:31 < harbhub> can't open them at all
00:31 < Youdaman> unplug/replug?
00:31 < harbhub> the first usb had the virus
00:31 < harbhub> and got plugged in at the same time as the second usb
00:31 < Youdaman> harbhub: ah k so not just a bus issue but an actual virus :<
00:31 < harbhub> and we cannot open anything on either usb
00:31 < harbhub> they are linking to folders that don't exist
00:31 < harbhub> yes an actual virus  :(
00:32 < Youdaman> bl
00:32 < harbhub> b1?
00:32 < Youdaman> (bad luck) :(
00:32 < Industrial> hendore: really depends on the database if you want data duplication, but having info on both sides doesn't imply a dependance deadlock. just create the one side first, get its id for the second, create the second and fill the first's id ?
00:32 < harbhub> ah
00:32 < harbhub> Youdaman:  thanks for trying to help; much appreciated
00:35 < Industrial> Youdaman: I keep reading Yodaman.
00:35 <@isaacs> dscape: yeah, that'd work
00:35 <@isaacs> dscape: or wait for me to fix it :)
00:35 < Youdaman> Industrial: undertandable, that is.
00:35 < Youdaman> understandable*
00:36 < harbhub> i hope everyone in New York is safe
00:36  * Youdaman ruins Yoda joke with a typo
00:37 < Industrial> every time you do that a trooper dies
00:40 < TooTallNate> relevant: http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/disney-says-it-is-buying-star-wars-maker-lucasfilm-for-405-billion-from-george-lucas/2012/10/30/dc0ace18-22cc-11e2-92f8-7f9c4daf276a_story.html
00:41 < Youdaman> my entire Twitter feed this morning has been Star Wars Disney jokes mixed with Monkey Island and suggestions that Nathan Fillion should be Han Solo and directed by Joss Whedon
00:42 < TooTallNate> i don't pay close enough attention to twitter...
00:43 < Youdaman> TooTallNate: and to think i follow you! :P
00:43 < bradleymeck> and honey boo boo can be r2d2
00:43 < Sly> ROFL @ honey boo boo
00:43 < TehShrike> >_<
00:44 < bradleymeck> ppl make me sad, so i pass it on :)
00:46 < dscape> isaacs: trying to do it myself
00:46 < dscape> but first i have to understand what the issue is :)
00:46 < dscape> eheh
00:46 < dscape> i'de rather not unpack and repack even if it takes a couple of hours to figure out
00:51 -!- mbalho changed the topic of #Node.js to: ᴎᴑᴅᴇȷʂ - the official evented I/O abstraction of honey bᴑᴑ bᴑᴑ - http://logs.nodejs.org/node.js/latest
00:51 < SomeoneWeird>  o god
00:51 < SomeoneWeird> no
00:51 < SomeoneWeird> CHANGE IT BACCCKKKK
00:51 <@mbalho> you cannot deny honey booboo!
00:52  * Youdaman googles
00:52 <@mbalho> its better if you youtube
00:52 < AvianFlu> truly so
00:52  * Youdaman slaps everyone involved in this honey boo boo debacle
00:52 < janmower> i find your lack of honey boo boo disturbing
00:53 < Youdaman> needs more honey boo boo?
00:53 < janmower> weesa gonna honey boo boo?
00:53 <@mbalho> Star Wars VII: The Boo Boo Menace
00:54 < SomeoneWeird> lawl
00:54 < janmower> unleash the honey boo boo and your transformation to the dark side will be complete
00:54  * jlord is from the same part of Georgia as honey boo boo. sad facts.
00:54 <@mbalho> be proud!
00:54 <@mbalho> #booboohood
00:54 < deoxxa[cookies]> isaacs: how do i pack a tar with node-tar
00:54 < Youdaman> i think i'd rather see more jar jar binks. there, i said it. anything but honey boo boo chiiiiild.
00:55 < deoxxa[cookies]> documentation is... not there
00:55 < SomeoneWeird> lol
00:55 < SomeoneWeird> like all the things
00:57 <@isaacs> deoxxa[cookies]: yeah.... i've been putting off writing docs until i have to rewrite tar and fstream for streams2
00:57 < deoxxa[cookies]> crib notes then?
00:57 <@mbalho> deoxxa[cookies]: i would imagine require('tar').Pack() returns a writable stream?
00:58 <@isaacs> deoxxa[cookies]: the best doc is to look at the examples or dig through npm's source code
00:58 <@mbalho> (just guessed from looking at the tests)
00:58 < deoxxa[cookies]> the examples show how to extract/read a tar
00:58 < juwiley> is it possible / wise to use node.js to create a sftp server?
00:58 < Raynos> Does anyone have scripts for parsing ptree or prstat into json?
00:59 < SomeoneWeird> juwiley, ofc, but why would you want to?
01:00 < juwiley> i have an application, need to allow users to upload files via sftp.  one way would be to install sftp, write a script to add/delete sftp users
01:01 < juwiley> but doing everything in node seems more interesting
01:01 < SomeoneWeird> http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc959.txt
01:01 < SomeoneWeird> have fun
01:01 < SomeoneWeird> :D
01:02 < juwiley> heh, yeah
01:02 <@isaacs> dscape: well... the problem is some subtle api surface inconsistencies between fstream.Directory and tar.Pack/Parse
01:02 < SomeoneWeird> juwiley, anyway, https://github.com/sergi/jsftp
01:05 < juwiley> thanks @SomeoneWeird was looking for SFTP, but that might get me started
01:05 < SomeoneWeird> yeah, better than nothing though
01:05 < dscape> deoxxa[cookies]: i can get you a working sample
01:06 < deoxxa[cookies]> dscape: that would be awesome
01:06 < dscape> as long as you dont want to get something from the internet and change it in memory and then pipe it to the internet
01:06 < dscape> lol
01:06 < dscape> thats what i am failing to do
01:06 < deoxxa[cookies]> well...
01:06 < deoxxa[cookies]> replace "internet" with "filesystem"
01:06 < deoxxa[cookies]> and you're pretty much spot on
01:06 < dscape> give me a sec then
01:07 <@isaacs> dscape: i hacked it a little to make the error go away, but now it's not getting the proper dir heirarchy
01:08 < dscape> isaacs: cool, i am trying to figure out fstream a little better
01:09 < dscape> so i can try to do something helpful
01:09 < dscape> in the end i think processing in memory would be beneficial 
01:09 < dscape> at least at nodejitsu, i can surely say so
01:13 <@isaacs> dscape: i think it's a problem with not having a entry.props.parent set

01:18 < dscape> ty isaacs 
01:20 < Jakey> isaacs: why isn't node.js binding to ios and android natively already!!
01:20 < dscape> deoxxa[cookies]: https://gist.github.com/2040815#gistcomment-342321 ?
01:20 < Jakey> since theres a way to make node.js on it!! think of the possibility for natvie apps
01:20 < Jakey> isaacs: !!
01:26  * Jakey slaps isaacs 
01:30 < hendore> with mongodb should I store _id reference in a document or use DBRef ?
01:31 < mscdex> sftp is a different beast
01:34 <@isaacs> Jakey: don't hit. use your words.
01:35 <@isaacs> Jakey: node is for servers, first and foremost.  if you can get it to run on ios or android, i'll vote up your blog post on hacker news.
01:36 <@isaacs> 👅
01:37 < SomeoneWeird> lol isaacs 
01:37 < SomeoneWeird> what about node-ios
01:37 < SomeoneWeird> :P
01:38 < jtomasrl> i have a nodeserver with socket.io and a client, how do i specify the "socket.io/socket.io.js" in the client?
01:39 < SomeoneWeird> <script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
01:39 < jtomasrl> i know, but the path, they are not on the same server
01:39 < jtomasrl> host
01:39 < SomeoneWeird> <script src="http://<host>:<port>/<dir>/<file>.js"></script>
01:40 < SomeoneWeird> same as any other js script
01:40 < jtomasrl> but the nodeserver is not serving that file
01:40 < jwulf> the socket.io server responds to the request with the file
01:40 < jwulf> magically
01:41 < jtomasrl> it doesnt with me
01:41 < jtomasrl> Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)
01:41 < SomeoneWeird> then your socketio isn't working properly
01:43 < jtomasrl> is it always http://<host>:<port>/socket.io/socket.io.js
01:43 < jtomasrl> ?
01:44 < SomeoneWeird> yes
01:44 < SomeoneWeird> are you sure you're serving the file?
01:45 < jwulf> are you sure that your socket server is listening?
01:45 < jwulf> because it sounds like it is not
01:45 < jtomasrl> info  - socket.io started
01:45 < jtomasrl> SomeoneWeird: Im not sure im serving the file
01:46 < SomeoneWeird> it should be
01:46 < SomeoneWeird> what <script> line do you have?
01:46 < jwulf> should be smething like
01:47 < jwulf> mynodeserver:3000/socket.io/socket.io.js
01:47 < jtomasrl> actually my server is hosted with a domain name
01:47 < jwulf> jtomasrl, what's your server?
01:48 < jwulf> are you using express?
01:48 < jtomasrl> restify
01:48 < jwulf> jtomasrl, this is what works for me:
01:48 < jwulf> var server = http.createServer(app).listen(app.get('port'), function(){
01:48 < jwulf>   console.log("Express server listening on port " + app.get('port'));
01:48 < jwulf> });
01:48 < jwulf> var io = require('socket.io').listen(server, {'log level':1});
01:48 < jwulf> io.on('connection', sockethandler.socketHandler);
01:48 < jtomasrl> that's what i got
01:48 < jwulf> you have to have your socket.io server listening on your http server
01:48 < jtomasrl> but with restify commands
01:48 < jwulf> got URL?
01:48 < jwulf> github / gist?
01:49 < jtomasrl> 1 sec
01:49 < jtomasrl> url api.mobki.cl
01:49 < jtomasrl> https://gist.github.com/3984334
01:53 < jwulf> jtomasrl, your http server is working?
01:54 < jwulf> you can connect to that server on that url and port?
01:54 < jtomasrl> that url i gave u is the http server
01:55 < jwulf> jtomasrl, https://github.com/mcavage/node-restify/issues/230
01:55 < jtomasrl> there should be running the socket.io too
01:55 < jwulf> not compatible with restify
01:55 < jtomasrl> great
01:58 < fox__> hi everyone
01:58 < wookiehangover> fox__: why the long tail__?
01:58 < fox__> i like long tails ;)
01:58 < SomeoneWeird> k
01:58 < jtomasrl> he's a fox
01:58 < fox__> a fox who needs some help using the canvas module
02:00 < fox__> i installed canvas last month, everything worked fine.. in the meantime there were some regular npm updates, nothing else... however suddenly i can't run scripts that require('canvas') anymore - throws the following error:
02:01 < fox__> Error: Cannot find module '../build/default/canvas'
02:03 < fox__> google didn't help so i created a new VM installed the latest debian, included sit sources and installed nodejs through apt-get, then canvas through npm, created a test.js with only require('canvas') and still the same error apperars
02:04 < fox__> so.. i'm stuck. any ideas?
02:04 < jesusabdullah> sounds like a linker error to me fox__
02:04 < SomeoneWeird> probably has todo with the relative paths in the module
02:04 < SomeoneWeird> hm
02:05 < fox__> am i the only one who can't run it anymore?
02:06 < fox__> the error happens in node.js:183 --- throw e; // process.nextTick error, or 'error' event on first tick
02:06 < fox__> at Function._resolveFilename (module.js:322:11)
02:07 < fox__> and yeah, i really can't find the '../build/default/canvas' path on my system
02:14 < fox__> :-(
02:14 < SomeoneWeird> tried looking at the source?
02:15 < fox__> sry i'm not having the skills for this
02:15 < fox__> one page says this should solve it: "npm install git://github.com/LearnBoost/node-canvas.git" but it also gives me an error
02:21 < dscape> can someone test this for me
02:21 < dscape> curl https://nodeload.github.com/dscape/nano/tarball/master
02:21 < dscape> is this a tarbal for you guys?
02:21 < dscape> someone doesnt want me to get shit done today
02:21 < fox__> 502 Bad Gateway
02:21 < dscape> :( *san panda*
02:21 < dscape> thanks fox__ 
02:21 < dscape> s/san/sad/
02:22 < dscape> 07:17 PM PST Tag tarball and zip downloads are failing. We're investigating.
02:23 < fox__> np i feel quitethe same
02:23 < fox__> suddenly can't get node-canvas to work anymore
02:24 < dscape> hope they dont ban my ip or something, i was just downloading some tarballs that's all :P
02:31 < fox__> well.. giving up :( cu
02:41 < reza> i asked in #express, didn't hear back yet, maybe someone here knows 
02:41 < reza> in order to get access to app in my route handlers
02:41 < reza> i did this
02:41 < reza>   app.use(function(req, res, next) {
02:41 < reza>     req.app = app;
02:41 < reza>     next();
02:41 < reza>   });
02:41 < reza> is there a better way?
02:42 < bakadesu> I think you can access it via res.app
02:42 < reza> i'll give that a shot
02:42 < SomeoneWeird> just pass it to your route handlers?
02:43 < SomeoneWeird> module.exports = function(app) { app.get('etc', .. }); then require('./route.js')(app);
02:44 < reza> @bakadesu - you're right it was already in res.app
02:44 < reza> thanks!
02:45 < cliffano> dscape: http://status.github.com 07:17 pm PST Tag tarball and zip downloads are failing. We're investigating. 
03:17 < Jakey> when will node.js be able to bind to native components on ios android windows 8
03:19 < Youdaman> Jakey: what does that mean?
03:40 < Jakey> omfg!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
03:40 < Jakey> this is so great!!! kirin native UI for js
03:40 < Jakey> i mean the whole concept is great
03:56 < SomeoneWeird> Jakey, ?
03:59 < Jakey> SomeoneWeird: i need an assistant a volunteer for an opensource project 
03:59 < Jakey> are you good with c++
04:01 < mscdex> dun dun dunnn
04:03 < Youdaman> Jakey: what's your project?
04:05 < SomeoneWeird> lol
04:05 < Jakey> Youdaman: why?
04:05  * Jakey slaps SomeoneWeird 
04:06 < Jakey> i have an idea for crossplatform stuff but i 2 of them out there but there are some pitfalls
04:06 < Jakey> @ Youdaman 
04:08 < Youdaman> Jakey: I know C++. What's your idea?
04:10 < Jakey> Youdaman: seriously
04:10 < Jakey> do you
04:10 < Youdaman> Jakey: seriously, do you have an awesome idea?
04:11 < Jakey> and how will i know you wont still my idea to gain your own profit
04:11 < Youdaman> because i can spell steal.
04:11 < Youdaman> and your idea won't be that awesome
04:11 < Youdaman> not to rain on your parade
04:11 < Jakey> Youdaman: seriously i think i have. and i don't know much c++
04:12 < Jakey> Youdaman: there are already some of it out there but there are somthings i don't like and it can be improve
04:12 < Youdaman> but if you don't know how to code in a particular language, your idea has probably already been thought of by those who do -- that is, if it's something only that language is capable of, which is also doubtful.
04:12 < Youdaman> ok, without giving anything away -- i don't want to steal your awesome idea -- can you describe it in one or two sentences?
04:13 < Jakey> crossplatform
04:13 < Jakey> ever heard of mono?
04:13 < Jakey> but i want to make it opensource with node.js unlike making it commercial
04:14 < Jakey> it will be hard but i want to make it opensource
04:14 < Jakey> like monotouch monoandroid
04:14 <@Nexxy> putting source on github isn't that hard
04:14 < Jakey> unlike*
04:14 < Jakey> yeah but i am not good of c++ 
04:14 < Jakey> i learn it way back..
04:15 < SomeoneWeird> <Youdaman> because i can spell steal. < lmfao
04:15 < Youdaman> Jakey: yes, i know of mono. i'm not sure you understand what mono or node is? no offence, but you want to make a platform out of a platform am i correct in understanding you?
04:15 < Jakey> Youdaman:  nope
04:16 < Youdaman> Jakey: and btw, mono is more for C#
04:16 < Jakey> i think node.js has all the thing mono has
04:16 < Youdaman> go on
04:16 < Jakey> and there seems to be node-ios
04:17 < Jakey> and i have the idea of native apps
04:17 < Jakey> aargg i don't want to give it too much details
04:17 < Youdaman> they're called native for a reason
04:17 < Jakey> you will still it and make it commercial
04:17 < Jakey> steal*
04:17 <@Nexxy> rofl
04:17 < Youdaman> i'm pretty sure i don't want your idea
04:18 <@Nexxy> Jakey, you're being ridiculous
04:18 < Youdaman> Jakey: again, no offence, but you're probably better off learning more about node (or mono, whichever)
04:18 <@Nexxy> also why are you slapping people in the channel?
04:18 < Jakey> seriously the idea is like what i told you Youdaman 
04:18 < Youdaman> Jakey: unless you're trolling?
04:18 < Jakey> monotouch monoandroid
04:18 < Youdaman> >.>
04:18 < Jakey> but node.js has everything already for crossplatform
04:19 < Jakey> you think i'm trolling because you haven't heard everything
04:19 < Youdaman> Jakey: define your understanding of "everything already"
04:19 < Jakey> i am still tackling this myself for now
04:19 <@Nexxy> Jakey, you're describing something like app.js for mobile
04:19 <@Nexxy> and at the same time, getting all bent out of shape over someone stealing "your" idea
04:19 < Jakey> Nexxy: probably.but this is native stuff
04:20 < Youdaman> Jakey: i just don't think you understand the concepts you're trying to glue together
04:20 < Jakey> Youdaman: i am 100% understanding it
04:20 < SomeoneWeird> define 'native' Jakey 
04:20 <@Nexxy> it's kind of ridiculous to ask for input and conversation on something you're refusing to fully explain in the first place
04:20 < Jakey> SomeoneWeird: only some part of it not the whole
04:20 < SomeoneWeird> wat
04:20 < Jakey> yes
04:20 < Youdaman> it's like: i have this amazing idea for a thing that flies, and it has wheels, but it's not a car. yes, it's a plane.
04:21 < Jakey> lol Youdaman 
04:21 < Jakey> you are trying to get it
04:21 < Jakey> i just want to see another commercial product
04:21 < Youdaman> i am, believe me.
04:21 < Jakey> just don't want*
04:21 < Jakey> i just don't want to see another commercial product
04:21 < Youdaman> Jakey: ok, to that end, how are you going to commercialise it? i mean, how is it going to make money? is it a service? do you license some software?
04:21 < SomeoneWeird> then don't make it commercial
04:21 < Jakey> with opensource behind it
04:22 < SomeoneWeird> put a GPL license or something on it
04:23 < Jakey> Youdaman: because its not based on opensource 
04:23 < Jakey> sorry
04:23 < SomeoneWeird> ...
04:23 < Jakey> Youdaman: because its based on opensource 
04:23 < Youdaman> so I have this idea right? it's like a Ferrari, but with parts of a Porsche. I call it: a Purrari.
04:23 < SomeoneWeird> lawl
04:23 < Jakey> lol its not the same with code
04:23 < Jakey> source code
04:23 < SomeoneWeird> yes, it is.
04:23 < Jakey> nope
04:23 < SomeoneWeird> mmmmmmmmk
04:24 < Youdaman> Jakey: it sounds like you are trying to combine two things that are already similar and not really worth combining to produce something that is greater than the parts
04:24 < Youdaman> they're different enough to be just that: different. but combining them doesn't really a) make sense b) provide any advantage -- i could be completely mistaken and not understanding you however.
04:24 < Jakey> anway if you want to help indirectly but will you? Youdaman 
04:25 < SomeoneWeird> lol.
04:25 < Jakey> Youdaman: seriously if want to help the opensource community help node-ios
04:25 < SomeoneWeird> i think he might want to know what he's getting into first
04:25 < Youdaman> Jakey: if you can explain it and make me understand then perhaps, but I think you're already behind the eight ball if you yourself don't have the programming skills to make it a reality
04:25 < Jakey> Youdaman: i will learn c++
04:25 < Youdaman> Jakey: my advice would be to learn more programming, and build it
04:25 < Youdaman> do taht
04:26 < Youdaman> that*
04:26 < Youdaman> Jakey: meanwhile, how are you going with Node? enjoying it?
04:26 < Jakey> can't say
04:27 < Jakey> Youdaman: seriously and anyone knows c++ pleas help out with node.js on ios and android
04:27 < Jakey> bindings
04:28 <@konobi> not doable on ios without jailbreaking the phone
04:28 < mscdex> no webos love?
04:28 < Jakey> and windows 8
04:28 < mscdex> :-D
04:29 < Jakey> konobi: yep
04:29 < Jakey> but..
04:29 < Jakey> there will be a way
04:29 < Jakey> because mono is already on it
04:29 < Jakey> and webkit is on it
04:29 < Jakey> because apple don't allow interpreters right?
04:30 < Youdaman> Jakey: ok, forgetting about the inner-workings and bindings and such -- what is the practical application and/or point of what you're talking about?
04:30 < reza> lol w/ this thread
04:30 < reza> ideas are a dime a dozen ... executors are not
04:30 <@konobi> just use phonegap
04:31 < Jakey> konobi: nope this is better than phonegap
04:31 < Jakey> phonegap still lags
04:31 < Youdaman> konobi: i don't even think he's talking about something that _uses_ phonegap... he's going on about something akin to node itself or mono or... i don't even...
04:31 < Jakey> like on iphone 4
04:32 < Jakey> sec
04:32 <@konobi> Jakey: tune it properly
04:32 < Youdaman> Jakey: forget about creating a new platform. focus on creating an app that uses one of the platforms, uses several libraries or frameworks within that, and make something practical that people want to buy, and then profit -- i think that's a much better use of your time ;)
04:32 < Jakey> seriously its somethin like monotouch mono for android
04:32 < Youdaman> Jakey: seriously go do it
04:33 < Jakey> but i odn't want it commercial
04:33 < Jakey> yes
04:33 < Youdaman> Jakey: go open source
04:33 < Jakey> since i can't find help
04:33 < Jakey> i think i have to do it myself either way
04:33 < SomeoneWeird> you do realise android isn't c++ right
04:33 < Youdaman> Youdaman: go. go now. do it. you can do it. i believe in you.
04:33  * Youdaman peps himself up
04:33 < SomeoneWeird> lol
04:33 < Jakey> SomeoneWeird: yes mostly
04:33 < Youdaman> Jakey: i can't do it.
04:34 < Jakey> SomeoneWeird: but iknow where to pull the code from to make it work
04:34 < Youdaman> Jakey: i can't read Swahili but i know a country where they speak it
04:34 < Jakey> okay sec afaik
04:34 < SomeoneWeird> I can read english but I can't read Jakeys.
04:34 < Youdaman> lol
04:38 < daleharvey> whats the best way to control the log output of modules I require / run
04:39 < Youdaman> SomeoneWeird: http://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/2011/7/22/555dcfe3-f9ff-47be-8ca3-20c5e9fc28d2.jpg 
04:40 < SomeoneWeird> something like that
04:44 < jerrysv> Nexxy: can you send me your email address?
04:45 < jerrysv> Nexxy: it is important for awesome.
04:45 <@konobi> o.O
05:05 < DTrejo> daleharvey: thats an interesting question u should tweet the answer
06:00 < devdvd> Hi all.  messing around with the cluster module of node.js and when i try to spin it up i get a bunch of "Error: getaddrinfo ENOENT" messages (4 of them to be exact cuz i have 4 cores in a vmware vm running gentoo with kernel 3.2.12) here is the paste of my code http://pastebin.com/73jtmhFw  i just pulled the example from the nodejs.org api docs so i might be missing something
06:00 < devdvd> any thoughts?
06:01 < SomeoneWeird> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9047094/node-js-error-enoent
06:02 < devdvd> http://pastebin.com/Y9YEzCvc  (there's the full error)  
06:02 < devdvd> ok SomeoneWeird , ill go read that now
06:04 < devdvd> SomeoneWeird, that doesn't really help because there they are specifying a file to read.  I am actually using the cluster module and theres no place to specify a file for anything
06:04 < SomeoneWeird> ic,
06:04 < devdvd> and /proc/cpuinfo is obviously readable because it knows there are 4 cores
06:04 < devdvd> cuz its trying to spin 4 up
06:04 < Aria> devdvd: That sounds like your listen setup on 12/13 is wrong -- one of the possible arguments to listen is a hostname to look up (ENOENT!) and bind to.
06:06 < Aria> devdvd: Also, your indentation makes it pretty hard to read your code for comprehension. Tidying might help you analyze your code.
06:07 < devdvd> Aria, ill do that.  Regarding the arguments to listen(), the script works just fine without the cluster stuff.  I am just using it as an example for learning clustering since that is a pretty data intensive script
06:07 < Aria> Hm.
06:10 < devdvd> http://pastebin.com/tn36P8aD
06:10 < devdvd> there
06:10 < devdvd> ran it through jsbeautifier.org
06:13 < Aria> Decent style.
06:16 < Aria> Hmm. Not sure there. You're doing an awful lot in that callback -- perhaps try commenting out all but the express setup and see if that eliminates it? A binary search through the code there could help see if you can isolate it.
06:16 < devdvd> ok
06:26 <@konobi> devdvd: remove "0.0.0.0"
06:31 < thirdknife> stable version ?
06:37 < tmpvar> so, I'm writing this awesome node addon that lets you do awesome things to a raspberry pi, but I've run into an issue.  Has anyone seen a segfault caused by a `return scope.Close(Undefined());`?  heres the backtrace: https://gist.github.com/3985466
06:42 <@konobi> tmpvar: tried not closing on Undefined() ?
06:43 <@isaacs> tmpvar: yeah, i don't think you need to close over Undefined()
06:44 <@isaacs> oh, wait, no, you do...
06:44 <@isaacs> tmpvar: is the code somewhere?
06:45 <@konobi> what type of handle have you declared as the return?
06:49 <@isaacs> konobi: should pretty much always be Handle<Value>
06:49 <@isaacs> konobi: as the return typ[e
06:49 <@konobi> yup
06:49 <@isaacs> konobi: Handle<Value> myFun(const Arguments &args) { HandleScope scope; blah blah blah; return scope.Close(Undefined()); }
06:50 <@isaacs> should be completely valid there
06:50 <@isaacs> tmpvar: ^
06:50 < tmpvar> let me push the codes
06:54 <@isaacs> this is kind of awesome
06:54 <@isaacs> http://www.flickr.com/photos/khaase/8138059146/
06:54 <@isaacs> some fascinating data in that graph
06:54 <@isaacs> but i really wish it showed how many were in each bar
06:54 <@isaacs> in raw terms
06:55 < tmpvar> https://github.com/tmpvar/node-rpi-egl/blob/master/src/binding.cc
06:56 < tmpvar> isaacs, ^
06:57 <@isaacs> tmpvar: you should return ThrowException, i think
06:58 <@isaacs> not ThrowException(...);return scope.Close(Undefined())
06:59 < tmpvar> isaacs, ah. it does run CreateEGLWindow correctly though. dies inside line #122
07:00 <@isaacs> tmpvar: huh.  well, that's weird...
07:00 <@isaacs> tmpvar: what about if you don't egl_createContext?
07:01 < tmpvar> isaacs, works
07:01 < tmpvar> hrm.
07:02 <@isaacs> interesting
07:03 <@isaacs> what is egl_createContext doing?
07:03 <@isaacs> tmpvar: ^
07:03 < tmpvar> i wonder if these methods are thread safe
07:03 <@isaacs> the v8 stuff?  it definitely is not
07:04 < tmpvar> calling eglGetDisplay() seems to prime it for segfault action
07:05 < vd1991> Hey i am trying to use node.js and three.js together. I need a http server to make some components of three.js work. But i am unsuccessful. I first tried to create a normal http server and try to send a static webpage. But I think all the dependent js and image files are not sent properly. I changed to use conenct framework and was still unsuccessful. Do any of you know what the problem is?
07:07 < wltsmrz> What's your server code look like? 
07:07 < wltsmrz> I don't have enough information.
07:07 < wltsmrz> Some folks do manage to serve files using node.
07:10 < vd1991> Heres the code: http://pastebin.com/RmGZEdsf
07:11 < wltsmrz> path.exists is now fs.exists. 
07:11 <@konobi> tmpvar: http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=5702 ?
07:11 < wltsmrz> I think connect has some static file server middleware.
07:11 < wltsmrz> Have you tried using that?
07:12 <@isaacs> vd1991: hey
07:12 < wltsmrz> In the very first piece of code on the github page you see some static usage https://github.com/senchalabs/connect
07:12 < vd1991> @wltsmrz: yup does nt  seem to work
07:13 < wltsmrz> Oh sorry I see that you ARE using it.
07:14 <@konobi> and your files are in `cwd`/public ?
07:16 <@isaacs> vladikoff:  						response.end(content, 'utf-8');
07:16 <@isaacs> er, vd1991 ^
07:16 <@isaacs> vd1991: that should be just response.end(content);
07:17 <@isaacs> vd1991: it's not utf8, it's just a buffer
07:17 < vd1991> ooh ok will give it a try
07:18 <@isaacs> vd1991: also:  					response.end(content, 'utf-8');
07:19 <@isaacs> vd1991: er, if (filePath.indexOf('.jpg')) {
07:19 <@isaacs> vd1991: strin.indexOf(x) return -1 if x is not found
07:19 <@isaacs> vd1991: any number other than 0 or NaN is "falsey", so -1 is "truish"
07:19 <@isaacs> vd1991: so that if() block will always get hit, no matter what
07:20 <@isaacs> vd1991: also, what's in the 'public' dir?
07:20 < Jakey> yoyoyo so what have i missed?
07:21 <@isaacs> Jakey: you should get an always-on irc connection that you reconnect to
07:21 < Jakey> sup isaacs 
07:21 <@isaacs> Jakey: like, running irssi in a screen or dtach session
07:21 < Jakey> isaacs: my buffer is erased
07:21 <@isaacs> Jakey: oh, noes!
07:21 < Jakey> lol
07:21 <@isaacs> Jakey: http://logs.nodejs.org/node.js/latest
07:22 < Jakey> yea yeah
07:22 <@isaacs> Jakey: if you set up your irssi to log, you can do stuff like this, too: http://static.izs.me/irclogs/
07:22 < Jakey> the thing is on ios android and windows 8
07:22 < SomeoneWeird> get a bounce
07:22 <@isaacs> Jakey: yeah, don't run irssi on those kinds of things :)
07:23 < Jakey> no kidding :)
07:25 < Jakey> sup SomeoneWeird 
07:25 < Jakey> can you pasted me your logs after i was afaik
07:26 < Jakey> ~_^
07:26 < phrearch> hm, path.join takes strings as parameters. is there a way to feed it an array in the same line?
07:26 < phrearch> path.join(mypatharray);
07:27 < wltsmrz> path.join.apply(this, mypatharray); probably
07:27 < psk> i have a simple question
07:27 < vd1991> @issacs: yup that condition was just to see if the images were sent properly. I had used it earlier. Now it is of no use. 
07:27 < psk> is node.js is EASY to learn
07:27 < phrearch> wltsmrz: thanks!
07:28 < vd1991> @issacs: I made the changes you suggested and tried, still the same problem. 
07:28 < wltsmrz> vd1991, 'public' refers to the local directory. You would access those files from '/jquery.min.js' for example. Not '/public/...'; 
07:28 < phrearch> yea that works! awesome
07:28 < psk> is node.js hard to learn because of its asynchronous programing nature?
07:28 < vd1991> @wltsmrz: yup so i changed the directory name as well
07:29 < phrearch> psk: just get started and try?
07:29 < wltsmrz> What do you mean? The client-side URLs?
07:29 < vd1991> http://pastebin.com/4wgKk4yf
07:30 < vd1991> this is the modified version i ahve
07:30 < psk> <phrearch> how?
07:30 < wltsmrz> Well, where are the files? in ./public or just ./
07:30 < phrearch> psk: think of something you want to create, and start building it by learning, trying and reading
07:30 < vd1991> just./
07:30 < psk> <phrearch>  ok
07:30 < psk> nice
07:31 < wltsmrz> What do your URLs look like, vd1991?
07:31 < psk> <phrearch> and what level of javascript one should know to learn node.js
07:32 < phrearch> psk: dont know. i just started myself two months ago. i really like it so far
07:32 < phrearch> only js i knew was jquery
07:32 < phrearch> that kinda helped i suppose
07:32 < vd1991> @wltsmrz: i am running a localserver. So i just call the localhost:8080
07:35 < wltsmrz> So to be perfectly clear, vd1991, your URLs would look something like http://localhost:8080/jquery.js and not http://localhost:8080/public/jquery.js
07:35 < vd1991> @wltsmrz: yup there is no folder called public. 
07:36 < tmpvar> looks like someone else ran into a similar problem :: https://gist.github.com/3968372 -- however they are not calling bcm_host_init()
07:36 < vd1991> @wltsmrz: I just checked my logger properly. It is unable to send the files that are not in the current directory. 
07:37 < wltsmrz> I'm sorry, but are you trying to serve files that are not in the current directory?
07:37 < vd1991> @wltsmrz: Error message in logger: "Error: UNKNOWN, stat '\\build\three.min.js\'
07:38 < vd1991> @wltsmrz: my main html file is in the current directory, while all dependencies are sorted in various folders. 
07:38 < wltsmrz> Is the HTML file served?
07:38 < vd1991> Yup
07:39 < vd1991> https://github.com/vandhanaa/Tank_fight
07:39 < vd1991> this is my directory structure
07:39 < vd1991> HTML file is served always
07:39 < vd1991> the images are served mostly only to the first client (even though the images are in the same folder)
07:40 < vd1991> but the controls are not working properly
07:42 <@konobi> vd1991: create a "public" folder and then move any files you want served in there
07:44 < vd1991> @konobi: and should i call for this "public" folder any where? For now i just use  			  .use(connect.static(__dirname))
07:45 <@konobi> vd1991: connect.static('public')
07:57 < vd1991> Hey thanks guys! I guess putting them in the same directory and making the suggested changes worked! 
08:34 < [AD]Turbo> hola

09:52  * milani is away: Away
10:03 < EuroNerd> My Express & Socket.io server doesn't send cookies in headers. How can I check if socket comms are considered cross-origin (CORS) ?
10:03 < EuroNerd> ..by the browser, that is.
10:41 < EuroNerd> Does anyone have experience doing sessions with Express 3.0 and Socket.io ?
10:51 < milani> seems node-gyp generates .lib or .so instead of .node for intermediate libraries in latest version.
10:52 < milani> it breaks binding.gyp files.

12:24 < jtomasrl> when using nodejs with mongodb and REST, should i use objectID in the URL's?
12:26 < nathan7> jtomasrl: Why not?
12:26 < nathan7> They're the primary key
12:27 < jtomasrl> dunno why i saw a video of stormpath.com CTO who said not to expose object id's
12:27 < nathan7> What are his arguments?
12:28 < nathan7> to me it makes sense
12:29 < jtomasrl> security
12:29 < EuroNerd> jtomasrl, yeah, but how exactly would that affect security?
12:29 <@Nexxy> if your app is vulnerable due to an exposed object ID
12:29 <@Nexxy> you have much bigger problems.
12:30  * nathan7 nods
12:30 < SomeoneWeird> i reckon
12:30 < mprem> hello, node noob here, is it possible to develop a multi-tenant app with node? 1 node app serving multiple websites?
12:30 < nathan7> There are performance upsides to it
12:30 <@Nexxy> yes
12:30 < nathan7> mprem: Why not?
12:30 < SomeoneWeird> mprem, http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/middleware-vhost.html
12:30 < EuroNerd> Nexxy, yeah, but you're still not saying how knowing object IDs would help the bad guys. They still need access to the db to be able to use those keys. What good are those keys if the system is secure?
12:30 < jtomasrl> so then how to reference objects in a RESTful site
12:31 <@Nexxy> EuroNerd, I think you misunderstand me
12:31 <@Nexxy> it wouldn't
12:31 < mprem> total noob, hence asking ;-), got bitten by py/django on this issues
12:31 < nathan7> Lookups by object ID are fast
12:31 < nathan7> mprem: Django is a framework
12:31 < nathan7> mprem: Node.js is an environment
12:32 < nathan7> mprem: You can get frameworks as restrictive as Django in node
12:32 < nathan7> (I think - maybe nobody has been crazy enough to build one)
12:32 <@Nexxy> nodes js is teh recipe for the revolution
12:32 < EuroNerd> lol
12:32 < mprem> thanks SomeoneWeird: seems vhost middleware will create 1 node server for each website
12:33 < SomeoneWeird> yep
12:33 < jtomasrl> lastly, should i generate customs ID's (for nested objects) using BSON ObjectId or encode32?
12:33 < mprem> SomeoneWeird: looking for 1 node server to handle multiple websites
12:33 <@Nexxy> mprem, why do you need 1
12:33 < mprem> to save operating cost
12:33 <@Nexxy> lol
12:33 < nathan7> ..what
12:33 <@Nexxy> to save a process?
12:33 < nathan7> You can run as many processes as you want, dear
12:34 <@Nexxy> COMMA DEAR, OUCH
12:34 < SomeoneWeird> lool
12:34 < mprem> well i did say i am noob
12:34  * nathan7 lights Nexxy on fire
12:34 < deoxxa[cookies]> so i just posted a message on the mailing list about https://github.com/deoxxa/jsmc (minecraft server in node) - would love input on it
12:34 <@Nexxy> your emotes are useless against me
12:35 < nathan7> deoxxa[cookies]: now the cool thing would be to build a client against the official server
12:35 < mprem> 1 node process for each website would need a lot of RAM
12:35 < nathan7> deoxxa[cookies]: and build this against the official client
12:35 < nathan7> mprem: ..no
12:35 < AvianFlu> deoxxa[cookies]: DID YOU EVER KNOW THAT YOU'RE MY HEEEEERRROOOOOO
12:35 <@Nexxy> mprem, how much ram would it take?
12:35 < deoxxa[cookies]> nathan7: that's a muuuuuch bigger project :P
12:35 < nathan7> mprem: a process takes 2M of RAM
12:36 < SomeoneWeird> lets get the server finished first hehe
12:36 < mprem> each website in tiny, just serving few dozen pages per day
12:36 < deoxxa[cookies]> AvianFlu: I AM THE WINNNNND BENEATH YOUR BLOCKS
12:36 < mprem> need to host few hundred sites
12:36 < nathan7> If you don't have 2MB of RAM
12:36 < nathan7> then you have bigger trouble
12:36 < nathan7> mprem: err
12:36 < mprem> well 2MB *100 = 200MB :-)
12:36 < SomeoneWeird> you can math!
12:36 < nathan7> mprem: Yes.
12:36 <@Nexxy> children...
12:36 < nathan7> mprem: Your processes are gonna need that memory anyway
12:37 < mprem> planning using just 1 heroku dyno till clients start paying
12:37 < nathan7> mprem: or are you gonna write your app to ensure it never goes over 2MB
12:37 < mprem> so need to keep cost lost
12:37 < nathan7> mprem: err, I'd just fire up multiple apps
12:37 < mprem> :-) i am not that good
12:37 <@Nexxy> mprem, what is it that you're planning on doing with such a shoestring budget?
12:37 < nathan7> well then
12:38 <@Nexxy> RAM is pretty cheap
12:38 < mprem> run few hundred sites on 1 heroku dyno
12:38 < nathan7> if you want to handle a few dozen requests on 100 sites
12:38 < nathan7> that's thousands of requests
12:38 < mprem> sites are tiny, not even 100 pageviews per site per day
12:38 < nathan7> and you want to serve thousands of requests on less than 2MB of RAM?
12:39 < NodeX> LOL
12:39 < CestSebastian> hey guys, having issues installing npm packages, on a debian system, that mounts a shared folder from windows 7 (virtualbox shared folder). Anyone had this issue?
12:39 <@Nexxy> how do you have 100's of node apps to run
12:39 <@Nexxy> lol
12:39 < mprem> not on 2Mb, but in 1 heroku dyno which is 256MB
12:39 < nathan7> mprem: Just write the app to fucking work
12:39 < kramutils> :D
12:39 < nathan7> give back app instances to your vhost routing thing
12:41 < mprem> maybe I am not getting this, I am using py/django which needs 1 wsgi process per website @20MB per site, so I am planning to move to py/flask which allows multiple sites to run in 1 process, 
12:41 < SomeoneWeird> heh
12:42 < mprem> I am considering node, but as I have no idea about how this works, so asking for help here
12:42 < sinclair_> mprem: interesting
12:42 < EuroNerd> Is there a reason why Express over https wouldn't put cookies in headers?
12:42 < sinclair_> mprem: want some help?
12:42 < mprem> sinclair_: yes pls
12:42 < sinclair_> mprem: im bored, with little to do right now, so i will tell you what i know
12:43 < sinclair_> mprem: first tho, why not App Engine?
12:43 < EuroNerd> (I'm pretty sure it's not CORS.)
12:44 < sinclair_> mprem: .....?
12:44 < mprem> sinclair_: did consider GAE ( and tornado), but node seems better due to non blocking
12:44 < mprem> non blocking all the way
12:45 < EuroNerd> Does Express automatically create cookies?  If so, at what stage?  When page is loaded?  When the first async request is sent from page?
12:45 <@Nexxy> that's because node.js is badass rockstar tech
12:45 < mprem> if I cant find a solution I will go with flask with gevent on heroku
12:45 <@Nexxy> mprem, what are these apps you want to run?
12:45 <@Nexxy> just static sites?
12:45 < mprem> simple/ tiny custom cms
12:46 <@Nexxy> written in what?
12:46 < instinkt> hey everyone. what's to be used as replacement for connect's util.parseCookie?
12:46 < mprem> currently in django, want to port to node
12:46 < sinclair_> mprem: AppEngine would still be a good option you know
12:46 <@Nexxy> ohh
12:46 <@Nexxy> well if you're going to be porting it anyway
12:46 <@Nexxy> you can design it to work within your constraints
12:46 < mprem> sinclair_: did spend lot of time on GAE, not too happy
12:46 < nathan7> I actually learnt Python because of GAE
12:46 < mprem> sinclair_: GAE is great platform but there are still issues
12:46 < filipminev> hey guys, is there someone who has experience running node.js on Dotcloud?
12:47 <@Nexxy> it's entirely possible to "vhost" multiple apps within one node process if that is your intention
12:47 < sinclair_> mprem: well, its a little propriety, but still better than a complete rewrite on a new stack 
12:47 <@Nexxy> perhaps not optimal, but possible nonetheless
12:47 < mprem> Nexxy: too costly
12:47 <@Nexxy> what is?
12:47 < sinclair_> mprem: nothing in node comes close to django in its entirety 
12:47 < mprem> vhost, with 1 node process per website
12:47 < EuroNerd> OK, guys, I desperately need help here. Express & Socket.io are killing me. And it's probably hours before TJ appears here.
12:47 < shanse> sinclair_ likes advertising app engine
12:48 <@Nexxy> mprem, that's not what I'm saying though
12:48 < sinclair_> shanse: no, i like advertising .NET
12:48 < mprem> sinclair_: dont want django :-) multi tenant is a pain in django, moving to flask if I cant use node
12:48 <@Nexxy> mprem, I'd think ideally you'd want to develop the app to scale horizontally across several "dynos" as needed
12:48 < sinclair_> mprem: well, there is some cool tech in node
12:49 < mprem> Nexxy: with py/flask, I can do it with 1 dyno, but would prefer to use node
12:49 <@Nexxy> so do it
12:49 < mprem> seems node has better performance 
12:49 < sinclair_> mprem: debatable 
12:49 < mprem> py/flask lib are blocking
12:51 < mprem> say a blog post with node performance about twice as fast as tornado, and flask+gevent is slower then tornado
12:51  * mprem is a noob, so please go easy
12:51 < sinclair_> mprem: blog posts say a lot of things
12:51 < mprem> they do
12:52 < mprem> but they know more then I do
12:52 < sinclair_> anyway, i can help you get started with node if you want
12:52 < mprem> sinclair_: would apprecaite
12:52 <@Nexxy> #jifasnif
12:52 <@Nexxy> \o/
12:52 < sinclair_> Nexxy: whats with that channel ?
12:53 <@Nexxy> it's a hashtag
12:53 <@Nexxy> and a channel
12:53 < sinclair_> interesting
12:54 <@Nexxy> it's basically like #Node.js but with no one in it
12:56 < instinkt> what's to be used as replacement for connect's util.parseCookie?
12:58 < jwulf> can't get my handlebars template to show up in Express
12:58 < jwulf> i put it in /views
12:58 < jwulf> does it need a particular file extension?
12:59 < EuroNerd> instinkt, don't take my word for it, 'cuz i'm still struggling with cookies and can't get them to work, but there's express.cookieParser, plus a separate require('cookie') module, so make your pick. ;)
13:00 < EuroNerd> maybe even express.cookieParser() uses the "cookie" module internally, don't know.
13:01 < instinkt> EuroNerd: express cookieParser is basically the same as what the connect one does?
13:01 < EuroNerd> instinkt, I have no idea, I'm a total newbie, but I'd imagine yes.
13:02 < instinkt> EuroNerd: ok, thanks
13:02  * jwulf answers himself: .html
13:03 < sinclair_> jwulf: i decided to follow your advice 
13:03 < jwulf> sinclair_, one class per file / module?
13:04 < sinclair_> jwulf: well, yeah, although in theory, a single compiled output works fine, I am losing the privacy of the module classes, im usually fickle for things like that
13:05 < `3rdEden> EuroNerd: instinkt: yes it's exactly the same, it's just exposed by Express so you don't have to install 2 dependencies
13:06 < instinkt> `3rdEden: my sockets still get 500 on GET, even with express' parseCookie
13:06 < instinkt> also, I'm using express 2.5.1
13:07 < instinkt> when did they change this in connect?
13:07 < instinkt> since which version
13:07 < instinkt> I'll just rollback to that version since this app was written like 6 months ago
13:08 < `3rdEden> idk ._.
13:08 < jwulf> sinclair_, i installed VS 2012 today
13:08 < sinclair_> jwulf: the gray and shouty version
13:08 < EuroNerd> instinkt, yeah, I'm trying to make sessions work in Express 3.0 + Socket.io for like 3 days now and still no luck. ;)
13:08 < jwulf> looking forward to see what it's like with the IDE hinting for TS
13:09 < sinclair_> jwulf: its pretty good, but i don't use the vs builds, i kinda opt for custom builds using tsc
13:09 < instinkt> EuroNerd: I didn't build an app in express 3.0 yet, where are you stuck?
13:10 < EuroNerd> instinkt, I'm not seeing any cookies in my headers. No idea why.
13:10 < sinclair_> jwulf: it needs a bit of work, but the hinting is great, and develop time type checking works across your entire project, so its nice
13:10 < Lander_lvbreda> EuroNerd Could you show what you have already?
13:10 < EuroNerd> Lander_lvbreda, just a second, i'll post my code...
13:11 < EuroNerd> Lander_lvbreda, you can fast-forward to where it says App Server Start   http://pastie.org/5142686
13:12 < sinclair_> jwulf: are you running a windows vm?
13:12 < jwulf> yes, as of this afternoon i have one
13:13 < EuroNerd> Lander_lvbreda, basically, I'm loading static .htm & .js, then the app connects to server thru websockets.  My apps data (here: login details) are properly sent thru sockets, but there are no cookies, so I can't set up a session.
13:15 < `3rdEden> EuroNerd: instinkt: i'm parsing out the cookie information using a regexp
13:15 < `3rdEden> lemme gist it
13:16 < `3rdEden> EuroNerd: instinkt: https://gist.github.com/3986964
13:17 < EuroNerd> `3rdEden, that's very nice but handshake.headers.cookie is empty for me. As I said, I'm getting no cookies in my headers. No idea why.
13:18 < `3rdEden> EuroNerd: cross domain or same domain?
13:18 < EuroNerd> `3rdEden, same domain, I think. (Browser would probably shout otherwise.)
13:18 < `3rdEden> hmz, odd
13:18 < EuroNerd> i know
13:19 < EuroNerd> I actually even added a little code to allow for CORS and see what happens, but still no luck.
13:19 < `3rdEden> Socket.IO handles it's own cors
13:19 < Lander_lvbreda> Is weird looks like you tried the right things:s
13:20 < EuroNerd> `3rdEden, I know, did that too.
13:20 < EuroNerd> I'm thinking now maybe I should try to first run one simple AJAX call at the start of my app, so that I can see if there any cookies, and only later switch to WebSockets.
13:20 < `3rdEden> EuroNerd: before you do io.connect on the client could you set: io.util.ua.hasCORS = false;
13:22 < `3rdEden> EuroNerd: you might also need to add io.Socket.prototype.isXDomain = function () { return true };
13:22 < `3rdEden> So it does a JSONP handshake instead of a AJAX call
13:22 < `3rdEden> which makes it easier to rule out certain issues
13:22 < EuroNerd> `3rdEden, that on client too?
13:22 < `3rdEden> yep
13:23 < `3rdEden> There's some code in Socket.IO that handles cors handshakes, but there have been some issues with it
13:23 < `3rdEden> so you might be having something related to that
13:23 < EuroNerd> still no cookies
13:24 < `3rdEden> EuroNerd: when you open the network panel of your browser do you see a JSONP request to the server?
13:24 < EuroNerd> And BTW, it shouldn't really be CORS, since it's the same local IP & port (server in VM). All that changes is switch from https:// to wws://
13:25 < EuroNerd> you mean in the first connections (static files load) or socket handshake?
13:25 < `3rdEden> socket handshake
13:25 < `3rdEden> it's a request to something like /socket.io/1/
13:26 < EuroNerd> Request URL:https://192.168.56.101:8080/socket.io/1/?t=1351689861867&jsonp=0
13:26 < `3rdEden> yeh that one
13:26 < `3rdEden> EuroNerd: do you see any cookies send with that request?
13:26 < EuroNerd> negative, ghostrider
13:26 < `3rdEden> not even on the browser side?
13:27 < EuroNerd> In Chrome's Network tab?  No.
13:27 < `3rdEden> Well, then ther are no cookies
13:27 < `3rdEden> :p
13:28 < EuroNerd> Yeah. I think I'll try normal AJAX and see if there are any cookies at all. If not, then sth is seriously f'd up.
13:28 < `3rdEden> maybe you set cookies on a different domain or path
13:29 < EuroNerd> In browser or server?
13:29 < EuroNerd> I certainly didn't do that consciously.
13:29 < instinkt> `3rdEden: your regex extracts an object of length 4 where first item is express.sid=XF9rqULMxYEu3FlbmXXxhIrh.UKZwDW0erstQtsRK8xn1MzQiV%2FO1U4nV2q9q6TmO%2BCI
13:30 < instinkt> now, the whole string is probably not the sessionID?
13:30 < `3rdEden> instinkt: i'm targetting connect.sid in the regexp, you probably want to target express.sid instead
13:31 < instinkt> yeah, I'm doing that
13:31 < EuroNerd> instinkt, actually, as I was researching my stuff, there apparently are "long" and "short" session IDs.  What you have here is a "long" one and the "short" is everything up to the "." character.
13:31 < instinkt> but it's essentially the same thing; what I'm curious about is whether the whole string is sessionID or just a part
13:31 < instinkt> oh I see
13:31 < instinkt> because this "long" still fail to work for me
13:32 < EuroNerd> yeah, so extract a substring up to "."
13:33 < instinkt> still fails.
13:33 < instinkt> I'll try extracting this: https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/blob/master/lib/middleware/cookieParser.js
13:34 < EuroNerd> What fails?  I assume you're comparing two SIDs, so print out both and see how they differ. Maybe you forgot to cut the "." character too. ;)
13:35 < instinkt> EuroNerd: No, I'm getting the right part of the string. The socket is still 500
13:36 < EuroNerd> you using socket.io ?
13:37 < EuroNerd> instinkt, BTW, what exactly fails?  Just cookies, or making a socket connection at all?
13:37 < instinkt> EuroNerd: making a socket connection. I'm able to authenticate the user correctly which means my cookies work
13:38 < instinkt> I just can't get the socket connection to work
13:38 < EuroNerd> instinkt, are you using pure WebSockets, or some lib, like Socket.io?
13:38 < instinkt> EuroNerd: socket.io
13:39 < EuroNerd> Well, I've got the opposite problem: my sockets work, just not cookies.  ;)  You want to let me look at your code?
13:39 < instinkt> yeah, just a sec
13:39 < EuroNerd> instinkt, oh, wait, you're using old Express?  I'm not sure I'll be able to compare that against my code. I use Express 3.0.
13:40 < EuroNerd> but we can try ;)
13:41 < EuroNerd> instinkt, BTW, did u see this tutorial?   http://www.danielbaulig.de/socket-ioexpress/   It's pretty neat, except it's old, so it doesn't apply to my code, as I use Expresss 3.
13:41 < instinkt> EuroNerd: yeah
13:42 < EuroNerd> ok, lemme see ur code, maybe i'll notice something... although I'm a total newb ;)
13:43 < EuroNerd> http://pastie.org is nice for sharing code. Just be sure to select correct lang so that color-coding works right.
13:43 < SomeoneWeird> gist
13:45 < instinkt> EuroNerd: http://pastebin.com/NeAv2sd2
13:45 < instinkt> EuroNerd: the relevant part is there
13:46 < instinkt> the session store is initialized with express and is in redis
13:47 < instinkt> it basically just can't find the session in my session store
13:49 < EuroNerd> instinkt, oh, so the socket does work, it's just the authorization that fails? I mean, if you commented out the whole authorization part, sockets would connect, right?
13:49 < EuroNerd> omg, is that coffeescript?  
13:50 < instinkt> EuroNerd: yes
13:50 < instinkt> it does not find the session in the session store for some reason
13:50 < instinkt> I don't know what fails, me not authorizing correctly or the express initialization of the session
13:52 < EuroNerd> Well, did you try console.log both sessionIDs and seeing what they are?  Maybe one will turn out to be an empty string? ;)
13:53 < EuroNerd> except, maybe it's not that easy to extract current SID from the redis store... ;)  no idea, haven't reached that part yet
13:54 < instinkt> you don't compare anything, you just look in the session store to check if the one you got from express.sid is there
13:55 < EuroNerd> yeah, you're right, but that's a comparison in disguise ;)  anyway, I'd try to pull out that SID from redis store and console.log it to see if it makes sense
13:56 < instinkt> it is there in redis
13:56 < EuroNerd> i know ;)
13:56 < EuroNerd> all i'm saying is maybe you can query redis and get that SID from it? 
13:57 < instinkt> that's what it does, it just that the one that you're looking for does not match the one in redis
13:58 < instinkt> I just found out that this cookieParser function fails
13:58 < EuroNerd> lol
13:59 < instinkt> this is the data.headers.cookie
13:59 < instinkt> express.sid=XF9rqULMxYEu3FlbmXXxhIrh.UKZwDW0erstQtsRK8xn1MzQiV%2FO1U4nV2q9q6TmO%2BCI
14:00 < instinkt> and this is stored in redis sess:XF9rqULMxYEu3FlbmXXxhIrh.UKZwDW0erstQtsRK8xn1MzQiV/O1U4nV2q9q6TmO+CI
14:00 < instinkt> the proble is, the function I used before for parsing the cookie data is non existent in current connect
14:00 < EuroNerd> ha, so it's the same SID, except one has f'd up special characters, like +
14:00 < instinkt> yeah, you basically have to url escape
14:00 < instinkt> rather convert
14:01 < EuroNerd> how about   cookie = require('cookie');   cookie.parse(data.headers.cookie)
14:02 < EuroNerd> anyways, gotta work on my thing... still no cookies   ;)
14:08 < instinkt> EuroNerd: fixed it by rolling back to original version of connect
14:08 < EuroNerd> lol, ok
14:08 < instinkt> EuroNerd: upgrading all this is just a mess
14:09 < EuroNerd> yeah
14:35 < joeandaverde> Is there a simple way to set the env flag in node to production while using npm start?
14:36 < joeandaverde> oh, and on windows
14:37 < context> joeandaverde: same way you normally set env vars ?
14:38 < joeandaverde> it doesnt seem to carry forward when trying something like SET=NODE_ENV=production&npm start
14:38 < joeandaverde> forgive me for incorrect syntax above
14:43 < sinclair_> joeandaverde: log out and in again
14:44 < joeandaverde> sinclair_: i'm running npm start as a windows service
14:44 < sinclair_> if setting environment vars, you may need to log out and back in in order for them to be accessible via a terminal / command line
14:44 < sinclair_> joeandaverde: not entirely sure why you would do that, but ok
14:45 < joeandaverde> sinclair_: npm start just runs node server.js for example
14:45 < q_no> can anyone help me with mariasql? trying to connect to my db but I only get access denied code1045. same settings work perfectly with node-mysql. mysql vers is 5.5.28
14:46 < felixge> q_no: why not use node-mysql? :)
14:46 < dmactough> joeandaverde: Can you use a batch file instead of running npm start directly? 
14:46 < joeandaverde> dmactough: I could. I was hoping for an alternative
14:46 < sinclair_> joeandaverde: oh, i just wrote my own one of those
14:46 < q_no> some guy... his name started with f, ends with elix pointed out some interesting benchmarks which brought me to mariasql ;)
14:47 < felixge> q_no: do you have a select statement where you expect more than 1 million results?
14:47 < context> im guessing its a fork of mysql ?
14:48 < context> projects dont generally just jump to 5.5
14:48 < q_no> nope, just many many many inserts
14:48 < felixge> context: yes, but I think q_no is talking about a node.js module called 'mariqsql' which can also be used to talk to mysql databases
14:48 < context> ahh
14:48 < felixge> q_no: you will be disk bound, there is not much the db driver can do for you
14:49 < q_no> felixge is right. it liked the idea that the interface works completely async instead of libmysql ;) (hope I'm not mixing things here)
14:50 < felixge> q_no: node-mysql is async as well
14:50 < felixge> anyway … I'm actually not saying you shouldn't use the mariasql module, it's not like I get paid when people use my free software :)
14:51 < felixge> I'm just saying that you're probably making a bad decision if you make your choice based on the benchmark stuff I talked about
14:52 < q_no> felixge: I'm only reviewing the alternatives ;) btw.. sent u a message
14:52 < mscdex> q_no: sounds like a permissions issue
14:53 < felixge> mscdex: hi :)
14:53 < mscdex> ola
14:53 < felixge> mscdex: are you here to steal my customers? :P
14:53 < q_no> mscdex: it does indeed, but the login I'm using is valid ;)
14:53 < mscdex> i'm here because i was notified :-)
14:54 < felixge> mscdex: : p
14:54 < mscdex> q_no: you can connect with the command line client using the same credentials? what connection options are you using?
14:55 < felixge> mscdex: looking forward to when I have some time to put that new experimental parser into my module … probably will be a while so
14:55 < q_no> mscdex: I do, works as expected
14:55 < felixge> but this performance thing is too much fun
14:55 < q_no> mscdex: the libmysql client also works fine, same credentials
14:55 < felixge> I can totally see myself writing my own assembly generator at some point down the line … *g*
14:56 < q_no> mscdex: also tried secureAuth true/false, no difference
14:56 < mscdex> hrmm
14:56 < q_no> I know, it's hard to make a guess without a magic glass ball ;)
14:57 < Taar779_w> Would anyone be able to help me with setting winston up? This is my config for winston http://vpaste.net/NHTad and I'm trying to use it within other files but only logger.info works.
14:59 < mscdex> q_no: what mariasql version are you using?
15:00 < q_no> 0.1.9
15:00 < q_no> and: mysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.5.28, for Linux (x86_64) using readline 5.1
15:08 < sinclair_> oh, nodejs is quite slick isn't it
15:09 < q_no> mscdex: looks like your are as clueless as me ;)
15:10 < mscdex> q_no: i haven't had the problem before, i'm installing 5.5.28 to try and replicate your setup as much as possible
15:10 < q_no> :)
15:10 < mscdex> i use mariasql regularly in production
15:11 < q_no>  node -v -> v0.8.14
15:12 < mscdex> and not that it should matter any, but are you connecting over the network or within localhost?
15:15 < q_no> I'm on localhost
15:15 < q_no> and it's a out-of-the-box mysql-server on centos ;)
15:16 < mscdex> whoa, mysql-server is at 5.5.28 on centos?
15:18 < EyePulp> so I understand the general strategy for dev-> production deployment of node projects is to include the node_modules with your repo, so you don't depend on package availability for deployment.  However, is there a strategy for the compiled bits and pieces to make sure those get built/rebuilt on production? And should I be ignoring certain directories?
15:20 < mscdex> EyePulp: maybe `npm rebuild` ?
15:21 < EyePulp> used that - but it seems like WAF is getting some directory names from my dev environment when I run rebuild in production.
15:23 < mscdex> not sure then, i always deploy to the same type of servers
15:23 < q_no> mscdex: I'm on centos6 and if I remember correct I got it fromt the centosBase repo
15:23 < mscdex> isaacs: ^
15:23 < mscdex> q_no: ok
15:24 < mscdex> isaacs: er, what EyePulp asked :-)
15:28 < bradleymeck> EyePulp: be sure to include waf clean || waf configure build before your compile steps if on 0.6 /cryaboutwaf
15:29 < EyePulp> I'm on node 0.8.8
15:29  * mscdex shakes a fist at waf
15:29 < bradleymeck> EyePulp: by on 0.6 i meant using waf in general
15:29 < bradleymeck> its not exactly happy cleaning or reconfiguring
15:29 < EyePulp> I see
15:30 < antgel> hi all, i have a question about websockets running on a node.js server - perhaps this is the most appropriate place to ask
15:31 < antgel> my app will have a websocket server and three clients (two android and one running in chrome on win32).  my question is, if all three clients connect to the server, is it possible to send messages from the server to only one of the given clients?
15:31 < antgel> it's not really clear to me.  does the server receive a reference to a given client?
15:31 < antgel> s/receive/contain/
15:32 < antgel> here's the use case.  i click a link via chrome / js.  this sends a message to the websocket server using the standard javascript api.  i then want the websocket server to pass the message onto either or both of the android clients
15:32 < antgel> *both of which* have websocket connections already established to the server
15:33 < bradleymeck> antgel yes it keeps a tcp connection open so thats easily done in all frameworks i know of except faye
15:33 < bradleymeck> well it is not
15:33 < bradleymeck> but used to not be so fun
15:34 < antgel> bradleymeck: thanks for the answer.  i'll paste my code.  i'm completely new to node, and to be honest i'm still trying to get my head around it
15:44 < slifty> greetings!
15:44 < olliejudge> Can anyone give me a good resource for a primer on Node? Coming from a rails background and want to give it a try
15:45 < jwulf> the node beginners book
15:45 < jwulf> really good, and free
15:45 < olliejudge> ah great I'll have a look for it
15:47 < slifty> I to am looking for a resource, but the next level up I suppose...
15:47 < slifty> last week I put out a thing called Opened Captions ( http://slifty.com/2012/10/introducing-opened-captions/ ) which is built on Express / Socket.io
15:48 < slifty> now I need to refactor it to follow best practices and have it work reliably
15:48 < slifty> basically I'm looking for "using socket.io in a production environment" tips and tricks
15:48 < fearphage> bradleymeck: looking at bundleDependencies. i added the module that i don't want updated. should it remain unchanged after an npm install?
15:50 < bradleymeck> fearphage: bundled not bundle https://npmjs.org/doc/json.html#bundledDependencies and yes
15:50 < bradleymeck> fearphage: if the install is above the package.json that has that however it will be clobbered since the parent is clobbered
15:54 < fearphage> bradleymeck: ok, here's the full breakdown. maybe there's a better way. i'm editing a package (grunt-cloudfiles) that depends on node-cloudfiles (nodejitsu package). i repeatedly run `npm install ../git/grunt-cloudfiles` and i want it not to updated its dependency (and edited version of) node-cloudfiles
15:55 < antgel> bradleymeck: http://pastebin.com/XAK7dDQG
15:57 < bradleymeck> fearphage: ok… bundledDependencies: [node-cloudfiles] in grunt-cloudfiles, if you are installing grunt-cloudfiles via npm above that since you modified node-cloudfiles bundledDependencies: [grunt-cloudfiles] as well
15:57 < bradleymeck> in the one above grunt-cloudfiles
15:58 < bradleymeck> antgel you have socket, just use socket.send and keep your sockets matched to an id however you want there are a few npm modules on this, but i dont work with socket.io much
15:58 < FunnyLookinHat> I'm having trouble understanding the OO concepts of modules with export - can anyone point me to a tutorial where there is a clear demonstration of how to structure different parts of your app ?
15:59 < FunnyLookinHat> Most examples I see are just inline stuff in app.js
16:04 < bradleymeck> FunnyLookinHat: unsure what you are trying to say, though geddy may be more your style if you want to match a single convention rather than mixing functional and oo
16:06 < antgel> bradleymeck: not sure i quite understand.  you mean something like io.sockets.on('connection', function (socket) { some_global_var = socket } then later in code do some_global_var.send(...)
16:06 < antgel> where i have three values for some_global_var?
16:06 < antgel> (3 different clients)
16:07 < bradleymeck> antgel you could do it that way, or use a pooling system object etc, var clients = []; function (socket) {clients.push(socket);socket.on('end',function () {clients.splice(clients.indexOf(socket), 1)});} //or similar if you want to roll your own
16:09 < bradleymeck> antgel look into http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6913801/sending-message-to-specific-client-with-socket-io-and-empty-message-queue
16:10 < mscdex> q_no: short of installing centos 6 and trying there, i just installed 5.5.28 fresh from oracle's site with the default my-medium.cnf config and i was able to connect with mariasql 0.1.9 and execute stuff
16:10 < mscdex> this was on ubuntu
16:10 < mscdex> :\
16:11 < mscdex> node 0.8.14 and on localhost
16:11 < EuroNerd> My Express server doesn't  exchange any cookies with my browser. What could be the reason? (I get no CORS errors. Server runs in a local VM.)
16:12 < FunnyLookinHat> bradleymeck, geddy, eh ?  I've been using Express thus far with decent results...  though it seems to just provide useful tools but no structure.
16:13 < FunnyLookinHat> Thanks for the suggestion - I'll check it out.
16:13 < tjholowaychuk> dirs != structure
16:13 < bradleymeck> just convention
16:13 < tjholowaychuk> just terrible rails
16:13 < tjholowaychuk> convention
16:13 < mscdex> q_no: oh wait, are you connecting through tcp or a socket file?
16:14 < mscdex> q_no: when you were using the mysql command line or libmysql ?
16:14 < q_no> mscdex: I don't now, tbh ;)
16:14 < bradleymeck> tjholowaychuk: meh, let ppl get what they want, idc personally
16:14 < q_no> I think tcp, connecting to 127.0.0.1:3306
16:14 < tjholowaychuk> yeah for sure
16:15 < simong> Is there a way to 'abort' an HTTP request (I'm validating an upload as it comes again and want to cancel the upload as soon as I can) ?
16:15 < tjholowaychuk> simong there's an abort method
16:15 < tjholowaychuk> oh an incoming request
16:15 < simong> yea
16:15 < simong> If possible I also want to send back a 400
16:15 < tjholowaychuk> you cant respond until it's done
16:16 < noxoc1> Hi there! 
16:16 < simong> Hmm, I'll just close the connection then
16:17 < antgel> bradleymeck: will do, thanks a lot
16:17 < noxoc> I currently quite psyched about nodejs and javascript. I come frome a rails background and was wondering where I should draw the line when to use node and when to use rails. 
16:18 < noxoc> s/I cu/I'm cu/
16:18 < EyePulp> noxoc: That's a bit difficult to guess at.  There's no obvious line to draw.  Just use the best tool for the job.
16:20 < EyePulp> We use node for mainly network based utilities, and not necessarily for full web-apps, but plenty of others use it for their full web stack
16:20 < EuroNerd> It seems my node.js server (run in local VM) isn't exchanging any cookies. What could be the reason?  (I've tested on a couple simple apps I wrote as I was learning node. Didn't notice previously.)
16:21 < noxoc> EyePulp: I'm currently writing a webapp that is entirely working with an api. I'm currently thinking about having 2 servers. 1 in node that streams the api, stores stuff into the database and emits events through socket io to the client. The other (rails) would be for the "frontend". Not sure if this is approach is good. 
16:23 < EyePulp> noxoc: Are you splitting it for the sake of learning node or because it seems like the best possible solution?
16:24 < noxoc> EyePulp: both, I think. Maybee I was just thinking about it for too long now that I miss the forest for the trees now. :) 
16:25 < noxoc> EyePulp: thing is, that it's currently only for a prototype and I don't know yet what's going to happen on the frontend-ish side. 
16:27 < noxoc> But now that I said it, I could write entirely in node, if the rails-stack was just for "browsing the db". So if reach a point where nodejs does not suffice my needs I could easily create a rails app for that, while the db is still fed by the nodejs daemon. 
16:28 < EyePulp> noxoc: try enough
16:28 < EyePulp> er, "true" enough
16:30 < jtomasrl> how can a nodejs framework no support socket.io and how to make it work?
16:31 < context> jtomasrl: what ?
16:31 < context> what does a framework have to do with 'supporting' socket.io or not
16:32 < context> just include socket.io to project and add it to your http server
16:32 < jtomasrl> context: well socket.io doesnt work with restify when givin the server as the listen argument
16:33 < context> https://github.com/mcavage/node-restify/issues/230
16:33 < context> apparently restify's fault
16:34 < context> guess you already posted
16:34 < context> anyway to start server and give restify it instead of relying on the server restify gives you
16:34 < context> or to get the raw server instance from restify itself
16:35 -!- mode/#node.js [+o piscisaureus_] by ChanServ
16:36 < context> try io.listen(restServer.server)
16:36 < jtomasrl> i was trying that :P
16:37 < EuroNerd> I need some suggestions. Why isn't my node server (on local VM) exchanging any cookies with browsers?  (Tried on the simplest node and Express apps.)
16:37 < jtomasrl> context: worked :P thx
16:41 <@isaacs> AvianFlu: this st bug is really strange.
16:41 <@isaacs> AvianFlu: in trying to track it down, i did find a completely different problem :)
16:41 < AvianFlu> isaacs: yeah, it is
16:41 <@isaacs> AvianFlu: which i'm fixing now
16:41 <@isaacs> i wonder if fixing this problem will make that one go away
16:41 < AvianFlu> it only seems to happen on smartOS, as far as we've seen
16:41 <@isaacs> AvianFlu: i got a test case that will fail with EBADF
16:41 < AvianFlu> I'll join you in your optimism, if nothing else
16:43 < Xeon06_> Hey guys
16:43 < Xeon06_> Any body ever used Globalize with node? How am I supposed to load additional cultures?
16:50 < DaMorpheuS> hey guys Im looking for someone who has expirience with riak!
17:15 < EuroNerd> OK, so I am able to send cookies by hand, but Express isn't sending any, even thought I told it to app.use(express.session ... ). Why is that happening?
17:15 < dz0ny> did you set session secret 
17:16 < EuroNerd> dz0ny, yes 
17:16 < gildean> iirc you also need the cookieparser
17:16 < simong> Has anyone been able to have nginx in front of their app servers and let it stream uploads to them? (afaict, it buffers the entire requests before proxying)
17:17 < EuroNerd> gildean, I am using it:  app.use(express.cookieParser(session_secret))
17:18 < gildean> EuroNerd: and those two are above your routes so they're used?
17:19 < EuroNerd> gildean, I don't use routes - at least not consciously.  
17:19 < EuroNerd> Feel free to review my code, I'm about to go insane:  http://pastie.org/5143836
17:19 < EuroNerd> (fast forward to App Server Start )
17:21 < gildean> EuroNerd: it's a bit of a mess, how about first cleaning up some parts, like removing duplicate requires etc.
17:22 < gildean> EuroNerd: here's one express app where i use sessions and user auth, you can check out how i do it: https://github.com/gildean/Hachi
17:22 < gildean> in server.js
17:22 < EuroNerd> does it use Express 3.0 ?
17:22 < gildean> yes
17:23 < tnorris> where can I find the build options for v8 in node? curious since node runs my perf benchmarks faster than my own v8 build.
17:29 < sashman> is router an external module?
17:29 < gildean> sashman: what do you mean?
17:30 < sashman> app.use(app.router..
17:31 < sashman> is this external or in express cause a module for that exist on npm
17:32 < gildean> sashman: it's a part of express
17:32 < sashman> k
17:32 < gildean> what the app.router does, is that it goes through your routes when the server starts
17:33 < gildean> so for example if you've set the env as production, all the views are cached at startup etc.
17:33 < sashman> aha ok
17:34 < sashman> cause im currently getting 'Cannot GET /login' by trying to build authentication with passport
17:34 < wmage> Hi... What's the best documentation tool for Node.js?
17:35 < wmage> I'm looking for something that would generate adequate documentation even if the programmer didn't write any documentation comments...
17:35 < tnorris> wmage: nodejs.org/api/
17:36 < tnorris> whoops. nm. didn't get all the way through it.
17:36 < wmage> yeah sorry, my bad :) I want to generate documentation from code
17:36 < wmage> I found Dox, but that doesn't give you anything if you didn't write comments
17:37 < tnorris> wmage: you can use jsdoc, and use the following: http://jsdoc.info/
17:37 < gildean> sashman: so there isn't a route for '/login' is there?
17:40 < sashman> an app.post('/login' route
17:40 < sashman> with the passport.authentication
17:41 < EuroNerd> gildean, I've reordered a few lines, but my code seems to be OK, as compared to yours. What could be the reason for Express not setting cookies automatically?
17:42 < gildean> EuroNerd: maybe the request object never passes the middleware for sessions
17:42 < gildean> that's my only guess
17:42 < EuroNerd> gildean, how would I verify that?  (mind, you're talking to a newbie)
17:44 < gildean> EuroNerd: maybe start by commenting out the routing functions used now and just create a simple app.get('/', function (req, res) { res.send(200, 'ok');
17:44 < gildean> and see if the cookie is set then
17:44 < aandy> EuroNerd: i just joined the conv, so sorry if i'm omitting details. are you sure that the session (and huts cookie) is _changed_ ?
17:45 < aandy> thus*
17:45 < EuroNerd> aandy, changed by what?  I'm not touching anything, it's all default Express session handling. 
17:46 < aandy> what i mean is, cookies are only sent when the underlying session changes (i.e. change value, add property to session obj etc.)
17:46 < aandy> there's no cookie rolling
17:50 < aandy> EuroNerd: do you have updated code (i don't see any passport code in your pastie)? 
17:50 < EuroNerd> god forbid, no passport
17:51 < aandy> ah, i thought you used passport
17:51 < EuroNerd> I switched a few lines around, but it's basically the same: http://pastie.org/5143987
17:54 < EuroNerd> BTW, establishing a socket connection and sending and verifying login info works. It's just the session itself that is the problem. No cookies sent in headers.
18:01 < ryanrolds_w> Anyone seen "gcc: error: unrecognized command line option '-threads'" when install Node.js 0.4.9 (yes it's old, I know) on Joyents base64 img?
18:01 < gildean> ryanrolds_w: sunos?
18:01 < ryanrolds_w> Yes
18:01 < gildean> iirc i saw a commit about that just a few days ago
18:02 < gildean> about -threads not working on sunos
18:02 < EuroNerd> Is it possible to do something wrong on the client side to prevent cookies from being established?
18:02 < gildean> i can't remember anything more specific tho, maybe some of the devs can answer that
18:03 < gildean> EuroNerd: did you try and simplify the route to test that the cookie is set?
18:03 < gildean> like make a really simple route just to see that
18:03 < ryanrolds_w> Thanks. Hopefully one of the devs will spot it.
18:04 < EuroNerd> gildean, should I put that app.get in app.configure ?
18:04 < gildean> no
18:04 < ryanrolds_w> gildean, Found this: https://github.com/joyent/node/pull/4211
18:04 < gildean> ryanrolds_w: i think you need to poke them a bit, or see the logs if you can find the exact wording
18:06 < ryanrolds_w> It looks like I just need to change -thread to -pthread
18:06 < gildean> ryanrolds_w: yep, that seems to be the fix
18:06 < EuroNerd> gildean, no cookies with  app.get('/', function (req, res) { res.send(200, 'ok');});
18:08 < gildean> EuroNerd: try to make a really simple server that only uses cookieparser and sessions and just that one route and see if it works even then
18:08 < gildean> EuroNerd: you could also ask in #express, there's a bunch of people there also
18:10 < ryanrolds_w> EuroNerd, app.<verb> calls don't go in app.configure
18:11 < jtomasrl> is it possible to append a key to a json object? i receive the object from the client and i'd like to append an ID to it before saving it
18:11 < EuroNerd> yeah, now i know ;)
18:11 < ryanrolds_w> EuroNerd, do you have a gist with a stripped down example of the problem? 
18:11 < EuroNerd> working on it right now
18:13 < mlebrun> is this cluster module still stable? https://github.com/learnboost/cluster
18:13 < mlebrun> hasn't been touched in a while :/
18:13 < tjholowaychuk> mlebrun no it doesnt work anymore
18:13 < tjholowaychuk> node's core has "cluster" now
18:14 < mlebrun> right, but it seemed like your cluster module had some convenience to it? any good wrapper modules for node cluster?
18:14 < tjholowaychuk> i think there are a few out there now i cant remember any names
18:15 < mlebrun> only one i noticed was cluster2, but i'll keep looking, thanks
18:16 < gildean> ryanrolds_w: you can put app.use in app.configure and they should work
18:16 < EyePulp> mlebrun: what are you trying to do?
18:16 < gildean> but it's not needed anymore in 3.0
18:17 < EuroNerd> gildean, I think I've stripped it to the core:  http://pastie.org/5144106
18:17 < mlebrun> @EyePulp I want to pull messages out of RabbitMQ, but I want to use cluster to workerize it
18:17 < EuroNerd> is that a good test code?
18:18 < gildean> EuroNerd: remove the secre from express.session
18:18 < gildean> secret even
18:18 < gildean> and the key also
18:18 < gildean> leave only store
18:19 < gildean> EuroNerd: and remove the app.configure, it's not needed
18:19 < gildean> as in, leave the app.use's, but remove the function from around them
18:19 < gildean> and it should work
18:20 < EuroNerd> yeah, done all, no cookie in header
18:21 < mlebrun> EyePulp: I want to pull messages out of RabbitMQ, but I want to use cluster to workerize it
18:22 < EuroNerd> code: http://pastie.org/5144129    
18:22 < EyePulp> mlebrun: so you want a cluster of clients reading out of RabbitMQ?  And then have them exposed as a service for something else to make requests to?
18:23 < gildean> EuroNerd: idk, that should work
18:23 < EuroNerd> node is running in a VM, so in browser I'm putting http://192.168.56.101:8080/ and I get "ok", with no cookies.
18:24 < gildean> EuroNerd: you got me, maybe your browser doesn't approve cookies?
18:24 < EuroNerd> tested in Chromium and FF
18:24 < mlebrun> EyePulp: yea, have the cluster read from rabbitMQ and then process the messages, but also allow me to make requests for statistic and things like that
18:25 < jtomasrl> why red.body is received this way: { '{ "key": "Value" }': '' }
18:25 < jtomasrl> req*
18:25 < EuroNerd> for a second there I thought maybe Apache is interfering (standard install on that same VM), but since I'm able to set cookies by hand ("cookies" module), then they obviously are able to work.
18:25 < mlebrun> EyePulp: i know i can do this myself with the cluster module, i just wasn't sure if something more convenient that existed on top of cluster
18:26 < gildean> EuroNerd: throw that last paste and your question on #express, maybe there's someone there that had an idea where the problem lies
18:26 < EuroNerd> ok
18:26 < gildean> EuroNerd: because from all that i know, that should just work
18:26 < gildean> (tm)
18:26 < EuroNerd> yeah, I know
18:27 < EyePulp> mlebrun: there's probably less work than you realize to the cluster side of the equation.  It's a pretty simple module.  
18:27 < EyePulp> mlebrun: the bigger question is whether you can make your worker processes play nicely with each other (or avoid each other smartly)
18:28 < airtanah> hi, does anyone use db-migrate? 
18:28 < airtanah> i would like to be able to switch between MySQL and SQLite for testing
18:34 < mlebrun> EyePulp: that shouldn't be too tough, i don't think? just check if it's a worker and if so, subscribe to the rabbit queue.
18:34 < mlebrun> i mean, my node app is essentially just a proxy anyways
18:34 < sinclair_> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URJeuxI7kHo
18:35 < sinclair_> for all those mongo fanatics
18:36 < spion> webscale?
18:36 < mlebrun> "you're fucked"
18:36 < spion> speaking of SQL, has anyone been playing around with PostgreSQL's V8JS ? :)
18:37 < sinclair_> mlebrun: its kinda funny :)
18:37 < sinclair_> "right tools for the right job" that is the lesson here
18:38 < mlebrun> sinclair_: agreed
18:38 < mlebrun> hybrid setups for ftw!
18:38 < spion> so when is MongoDB the right tool according to the video? :/
18:38 < mlebrun> spion: none-business-critical features
18:39 < mlebrun> ie. an activity feed
18:39 < sinclair_> i think ill stick with SQL Server
18:39 < sinclair_> tho, i do like redis
18:39 < mlebrun> sinclair_: just depends on how saucy you feel like being
18:41 < tjholowaychuk> sql server?
18:41 < spion> what I like about mongodb is the "query langauge"
18:41 < tjholowaychuk> ew
18:41 < tjholowaychuk> good luck with M$ bullshit
18:41 < sinclair_> ....
18:43 < mlebrun> yea, i'm all set with sql server
18:43 < sinclair_> tjholowaychuk: your opinion, i care not
18:43 < slifty> is there any non-duct-taped way to run a series of express vhosts from multiple processes on the same port?
18:43 < tjholowaychuk> haha
18:44 < gildean> slifty: on the same port? not that i know of
18:44 < slifty> hmmmmm
18:44 < gildean> slifty: the easiest is usually just running them on different ports and having a reverse-proxy listen on the one port and proxy the connections to the right server
18:45 < slifty> I was about to ask if that was a viable option :D
18:45 < slifty> hooray!
18:45 < slifty> all right, I'll explore that option
18:45 < slifty> thanks!
18:46 < jhsto> I have a basic JS question - I have a event which triggers the browser's native alert popup, which displays everything fine, but when I call the event again, the alert box comes up twice. Any suggestion what might cause this?
18:46 < mlebrun> double binding?
18:46 < spion> does it come up 3 times when you call it the 3rd time?
18:47 < jhsto> Yes
18:47 < spion> if yes, you are adding a listener from the listener.
18:47 < spion> (don't do that, add the listener once)
18:48 < jhsto> spion, thanks, let me try it
18:55 < jhsto> spion, I did not completely understand what you tried to tell me. Here's the code: https://gist.github.com/3989086
18:58 < gildean> jhsto: you cut out too much, it's hard to tell by that alone
19:00 < jhsto> gildean, updated
19:02 < gildean> jhsto: move the listener on.('abort') from inside the function
19:03 < jhsto> Ah thanks gildean, it works right now, cheers
19:04 < gildean> np
19:12 < Guest6259> May I ask a brief question about using LESSC on Ubuntu?
19:18 < sashman> is anybody familiar with passport?
19:42 < sinclair_> happy november 
19:42 < blazes816> slow your roll it's still october here
19:43 < sinclair_> :)
19:45 < sinclair_> http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-20151789 <-- should run the rover on node
20:01 < drewwestrick> Anyone care to share their favorite IDE or text editor for developing in Node.js?
20:01 < psk> is Eloquent javascript is good book for learning javascript => i want to learn javascript for node.js
20:01 < aandy> sublime text 2
20:01 < psk> gedit
20:01 < aandy> and vim
20:02  * Orbitrix polishes your node
20:02 < drudge> drewwestrick: Chocolat
20:02 < Orbitrix> cant wait till i can legitimately afford sublime text 2
20:02 < drewwestrick> Best method of debugging?
20:02 < psk> gedit
20:02 < psk> is Eloquent javascript is good book for learning javascript => i want to learn javascript for node.js
20:02 < Orbitrix> i feel bad pirating it
20:03 < Orbitrix> cause its so good
20:03 < Orbitrix> i wana support him
20:03 < sinclair_> drewwestrick: currently, visual studio with TypeScript
20:03 < Orbitrix> (yes i'm really that poor)
20:03 < aandy> is sublime text that expensive now?
20:03 < drudge> drewwestrick: either the built-in debugger or node-inspector
20:03 < robinson_k> hi
20:03 < Orbitrix> aandy: no lol
20:03 < Orbitrix> i'm just uber poor
20:03 < aandy> i bought it when he released the beta. was about 10$ or so, but i know he raised the price later
20:03 < aandy> hehe, okay
20:03 < Orbitrix> damn, lucky, its definitely more pricey then that now
20:03 < Orbitrix> but not over $100 i dont think
20:04 < aandy> $59
20:04 < mlebrun> you can download sublime and try it indefinitely.
20:04 < Orbitrix> pretty much yea, it just nags you ever 3-5 saves or so
20:05 < Orbitrix> (and its easy to crack that :X)
20:05 < Pilate> gets bad if you try using the scp addon, it does the popups too
20:05 < mlebrun> more like 20-30 saves
20:05 < gf3> VIM IS FREE
20:05 < aandy> or you can wake up the internal RE child in you, and remove it yourself - or patch the pubkey cert (which i think is what the pirated versions do)
20:05 < Pilate> lol and yeah 20-30
20:05 < gf3> JUSSAYIN'
20:05 < aandy> :P
20:05 < Orbitrix> haha tru tru gf3
20:06 < aandy> still, i'm this close to buying you a license, but you're up against redcross donation right now :D
20:08 < aandy> btw, i have a "complicated" question. i have two versions of some videos, high res and low res. they're sort of long (10 mins), so as an exercise i'd like to try to make my web playback bw aware. anyone have ideas how to go about this?
20:08 < aandy> my first thought was to use the offset of one file (when changing formats), as a 1:x ratio and then find the closest full frame/cluster, but i have my doubts this would work in practice
20:09 < mscdex> give the user two links
20:09 < mscdex> ;-)
20:09 < aandy> hehe
20:09 < aandy> well, i mean, sort of like how netflix and cbs.com does it
20:09 < aandy> but i'm using html5, not silverlight/flash crap
20:09 < mscdex> youtube has a format popup menu
20:09 < aandy> right, but that just buffers if your bw is slow for your format, doesn't it?
20:10 < mscdex> eh? it allows you to select what resolution you want, it usually starts out at the lower one though
20:10 < mscdex> allowing you to upgrade if you want
20:10 < aandy> if i chose 1080p and i'm on 56k, i'll just have to wait. i was more thinking of switching between high/low res based on how quick the buffer is filled (similar to how netflix does it)
20:11 < aandy> but that's actually not imporant. if we take what you said, mscdex , and do a "upgrade" buttonw, how would you switch?
20:11 < mscdex> i dunno, i personally don't care for automatic switching like that, unless the user explicitly enables that feature
20:12 < aandy> find the same timecode in both streams, then use that as offset for the streaming (as in, 206)
20:12 < mscdex> yeah, that's roughly what youtube does i think
20:13 < aandy> mscdex: i agree, particular with the way cbs does (forces down), but having a on/off "enable HD if possible" might not be such a bad UX
20:13 < aandy> ok, bah. i was afraid of that :) thanks
20:16 < aandy> it'll end up being quite elaborate, as i'm replacing certain frames aswel, live, during streaming to insert marks. that'll scew the "original file offset" vs. browsers range x-y even further. but at least we're not enforcing flash on our customers
20:19 < Cheery> is it okay if I license my library GPLv3?
20:20 < mscdex> Cheery: MIT all the way! :-D
20:20 < aandy> +1
20:21 < aandy> reminds me how much i hate licenses
20:21 < Cheery> mscdex: reason please. :)
20:21 < aandy> generally more open, and liberal in usage
20:21 < mscdex> yeah
20:21 < mscdex> and short and simple and easy to understand
20:21 < mscdex> :-)
20:21 < Cheery> doesn't the recent java API copyright case mean that APIs are essentially uncopyrightable?
20:22 < Cheery> therefore it'd be okay for my library to be GPL.
20:22 < Cheery> but then.
20:22 < Cheery> it's simple library.
20:22 < Cheery> maybe it'll be loved more if I MIT license it
20:22 < bradleymeck> Cheery no, that was not on the table, it just means you need proof of investment if anything
20:23 < Cheery> proof of investment?
20:24 < bradleymeck> Cheery basically you need to prove that it is a work that is of value so it is something that could be copyrightable, the case came down to a few instances of code which were deemed unfit for application during the copyright evaluation, not that the copyright was invalidated
20:24 < aandy> Cheery: wasn't really that they weren't copyright'able as much as it was "they're general"
20:24 < aandy> they still had to reimplement the public api from scratch
20:25 < bradleymeck> well that and the fact that it was retroactive suit differing from previous implications by Sun after Oracle bought them
20:25 < Cheery> copyrights and patents are stupid, were they used for freedom or against.
20:26 < bradleymeck> for complex works they are important for business logic in particular, for generic use less so
20:26 < bradleymeck> patent length on tech patents is lol though
20:26 < Cheery> I don't think they are important even for business to function.
20:26 < aandy> let me patent scrolling on a website
20:27 < aandy> there, set for life
20:27 < aandy> *drinks martini at beach*
20:27 < bradleymeck> Cheery to function no, but to provide protection while allowing reseach and investment for a time while the invention can have an advantage without exhausting its use case for future business is why patents are around, not what they are used for
20:28 < bradleymeck> patents let you release your findings and improve derivative works, but instead of that we have to protect them with such vigor and aggression by law just to keep them that they are dumb in most 1st world countries
20:29 < aandy> still, im my opinion, there's a difference between openly sharing code and enforcing the patent, and open sourcing
20:30 < aandy> oh, this is exactly what we need, and we can mod it to fit our project perfectly. oh, it's under som gpl or whichever. we'll have to reinvent the wheel. great minds at work
20:30 < bradleymeck> aandy thats not patents, thats copyleft problems
20:31 < aandy> i'd hope so, otherwise they're poor at managine patents (or they're too general/easy to implement) :)
20:31 < aandy> but yeah, copyright/left in terms of Cheery's question
20:32 < bradleymeck> aandy in particular i would research the patents in GPU tech and why open sourcing them causes competitive disadvantage in particular with shader tech and CUDA/OpenCL
20:32 < Cheery> okay.
20:32 < bradleymeck> ppl will reverse engineer it which is good in my opinion though, basically gives time for the advantage to wear out and keeps in the spirit of things
20:33 < aandy> bradleymeck: what's the status on that btw? opencl is not really openly licensed last i checked
20:33 < Cheery> I guess you talked it through.
20:33 < aandy> been somewhat interested in opencl for the past 6 months :)
20:33 < bradleymeck> "open"cl yea… its never going to be 100% open
20:34 < Cheery> I'd like software freedom, but I don't believe it's achievable with copyrights or patents
20:34 < bradleymeck> at least not while hardware design is so closely tied to it and minor advantages can make or break the businesses
20:35 < creationix> cloud9 is so awesome these days, if only it worked offline
20:35 < bradleymeck> 100% software freedom is closely related to not being able to have any advantages in a business, which would blow
20:35 < bradleymeck> creationix: you can run it locally at least (kinda… partly...)
20:36 < aandy> i'm an odd fish. i don't support 100% freedom, and i don't like patents/gpl gibberish. if you can create something great, by all means keep it to yourself. you made it, your reward. if you share your findings to get feedback from a (large) community, like open source/publish on github, then your IP is pretty much lost, as it should be. quiquid pro quo. 
20:36 < Cheery> bradleymeck: it isn't advantage enough that you're freed to roll your own stuff?
20:36 < creationix> yeah, I might have to fix that
20:36 < creationix> (I do work there you know)
20:36 < bradleymeck> creationix, i know, i troll :)
20:36 < creationix> seriously though, I'm actually impressed by it
20:36 < creationix> even if I didn't work there I would recommend it
20:36 < creationix> it's the best editor for js out there
20:37 < creationix> but the browser experience sucks
20:37 < bradleymeck> Cheery as an individual it would be awesome, as someone who wants to be successful it would be insanely hard to keep competitive
20:37 < tmpvar> is Cheery the cheery on github?
20:37 < bradleymeck> not for me not wanting to share, but from individuals being able to completely do things for free
20:37 < Cheery> tmpvar: yea
20:37 < tmpvar> word
20:37 < bradleymeck> or ppl rolling copy cats
20:37 < creationix> bradleymeck: have you tried c9 seriously recently?
20:38 < bradleymeck> creationix im stuck in vim due to ssh
20:38 < jhsto> I have a similar problem, I have this application I would like to charge something, but I'm unsure to do because there could be competitors so fast
20:38 < creationix> I use cloud9 over ssh all the time
20:38 < aandy> Cheery: https://github.com/CHERRy/HUGS----AND---KISSES----XOXO this? :)
20:38 < creationix> though it is a premium feature
20:38 < Cheery> creationix: I saw another webgl project beside yours. I decided to make yet third and just look at what you had done. :)
20:38 < tmpvar> Cheery, i saw your gist. (rpi EGL node segfault) .. been trying to get this going as well
20:38 < creationix> Cheery: cool
20:38 < Cheery> creationix: I'm almost done
20:38 < bradleymeck> creationix can i use proxycommand and not do funky ssh tunnels with port binding
20:39 < creationix> what's proxycommand?
20:39 < aandy> Cheery: your node-video looks interesting
20:39 < creationix> the c9 ssh tunnel is my invention
20:39 < bradleymeck> its basically an ssh tunnel without a designated port
20:40 < bradleymeck> tunnels break on our proxy server since they were overloading local ports too much
20:40 < creationix> it basically spawns node on the far end, pipes some js code over stdin, and speaks smith protocol over the stdio
20:40 < Cheery> aandy: that's basicly the thing. I'm glad you like it. especially since just verbal support helps getting it done.
20:40 < bradleymeck> ah, cant spawn node in these small things
20:40 < mscdex> a smith agent!
20:41 < creationix> bradleymeck: there is no guy for custom ssh commands, but that would be a neat addition if you were running the node proxy on your laptop
20:41 < creationix> *gui
20:41 < bradleymeck> would love if i could tell cloud9 to use a ssh connection and just have it do a tty for me, then maybe, but i cant have remote do anything
20:41 < bradleymeck> except ssh and something small like vim
20:41 < creationix> we do tty over the tunnel
20:41 < creationix> I vim in cloud9 all the time
20:41 < creationix> for files outside the repo root
20:42 < creationix> since the html guy can only see files in the repo
20:43 < bradleymeck> creationix i would have to use `ssh -o "ProxyCommand=ssh internalserver | nc 22" wanserver  -- vim` is what im saying I cant have something running in my lil 256mb areas
20:43 < bradleymeck> either way ill take a closer look sometime
20:43 < bradleymeck> see if i can muck it to work out
20:43 < creationix> sure, let me know what you need
20:43 < creationix> the editor has gotten super awesome
20:43 < bradleymeck> i know that :)
20:43 < creationix> I can't use sublime anymore, I've been spoiled
20:44 < bradleymeck> creationix still using that fancy parser for ace or moved to esprima?
20:44 < creationix> last I heard, it's still the hacked up one based on uglify
20:44 < creationix> but they want to move to esprima
20:44 < bradleymeck> would love if i could muck with AST as a macro
20:44 < bradleymeck> thats beyond overkill though
20:44 < creationix> like a compile-to-js language or as a c9 addon?
20:45 < aandy> bradleymeck: btw, if you remember i asked you for assistance on some login/session setup not too long ago. i went with ip/ua + session id, and i don't invalidate sessions if they don't match, but send the "attacker" to /login. is that how you're suppose to do (if i'm trying to protect users from hijacking)?
20:45 < bradleymeck> generally i redirect them to login yea
20:45 < aandy> ok, thanks :)
20:45 < bradleymeck> creationix, c9addon, so I could do things like complain about leaking globals and prompt them to fix themselves
20:46 < creationix> I'm pretty sure you can do that today as a 3rd party addon
20:46 < creationix> talk to Matt or Garen about it
20:46 < bradleymeck> creationix: too busy with other projects
20:46 < bradleymeck> i might be able to
20:47 < creationix> but we've got some pretty neat js lint stuff already
20:47 < creationix> one new one I like is it warns you if you use "this" in a callback
20:47 < bradleymeck> creationix: i do other things, like pulling out functions that are not dependant on scope etc
20:47 < creationix> that would be cool, refactor tools
20:47 < bradleymeck> running hoisting beforehand
20:47 < creationix> ast fun...
20:48 < bradleymeck> running hoisting helped me a couple times but is more just fancy
20:48 < mlebrun> when you build an app with flatiron, how do you access your config vars that you set in config/config.json ?
20:49 < bradleymeck> app.config.get('x:y')
20:49 < mlebrun> ah, thanks!
20:49 < Cheery> https://github.com/cheery/node-video/commit/b1f4b6b2d51240c365b9930fa995cf5de2c69a4d
20:49 < Cheery> creationix: would you like to contribute?
20:49 < bradleymeck> mlebrun: app.config.file().env().argv().defaults() is how i normally go
20:49 < bradleymeck> for ordering
20:50 < creationix> Cheery: yes, but I don't have time for a while
20:50 < Cheery> oh okay
20:50 < creationix> also vanilla http streaming has been plenty for me
20:50 < mlebrun> gotcha
20:50 < Cheery> hey anyone? want to contribute at the moment? :)
20:50 < creationix> oh, never mind, this is for GUI 
20:50 < creationix> that is neat
20:51 < tmpvar> Cheery, how did you get around the segfaults?
20:51 < Cheery> tmpvar: https://github.com/cheery/node-video/blob/master/node-video
20:51 < Cheery> tmpvar: that's a lousy hack and I filed an issue into raspberry pi firmware
20:52 < Cheery> https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/issues/112
20:52 < creationix> Cheery: did you see the news about the rasp pi open sourcing more of their firmware?
20:52 < creationix> or rather broadcom opening more
20:52 < aandy> or the class on writing OS'es for rasp pi?
20:53 < Cheery> creationix: sure. but it didn't really affect this project
20:53 < creationix> lol, "This is just plain ugly though"
20:53 < creationix> yep, that's my experience with video core stuff
20:55 < tmpvar> Cheery, that's nasty
20:55 < Cheery> maybe it's time to MIT-license it. 
20:55 < tmpvar> Cheery, i wonder what the root cause is
20:57 < tmpvar> Cheery, the actual segfault I was seeing (https://gist.github.com/3985466) looks like its in V8.. so weird
20:58 < Cheery> it'd be good if we could fix it. I think I'll take on it later.
20:58 < tmpvar> Cheery, agreed.. and then split the context creation out into its own module
20:59 < Cheery> like I have done already+
20:59 < Cheery> ?
21:00 < tmpvar> no, an npm installable package
21:00 < tmpvar> i'd help with that
21:00 < tmpvar> npm install rpi-context-creator-module
21:00 < tmpvar> haha
21:00 < Cheery> hah. :)
21:00 < Cheery> tmpvar: I have pretty cool idea for this in fact.
21:00 < tmpvar> me too :)
21:01 < Cheery> tmpvar: lets make it easy-to-use C module.
21:01 < Cheery> and do maybe 'context' -nodejs module, and put these webgl. etc. register under it.
21:01 < tmpvar> Cheery, sure, have you seen https://github.com/benosteen/opengles-book-samples/blob/master/Raspi/Common/esUtil.c ?
21:02 < Cheery> tmpvar: that is pretty
21:02 < tmpvar> Cheery, once you have a context you can use whatever other node library you want that renders to opengl or similar
21:02 < tmpvar> so context creation can be completely separate :)
21:03 < Cheery> I'll think about it
21:03 < Cheery> I want desktop experiment platform. but I see what you've got in mind.
21:03 < tmpvar> yeah, well i want a 3d uv resin printer
21:03 < tmpvar> :P
21:05 < Cheery> I think I get to implementing those functions one by one.
21:06 < sashman> to use connect-redis to store sessions do i need to require standard redis and run a redis-server?
21:10 < raj> I just created a new virtualenv and did `node --version` and it spit out `v0.5.5` but I never downloaded node
21:12 < sashman> is socket.io a must have?
21:13 < chilts> sashman: if you use connect-redis, then yes, you need a redis server to connect to
21:14 < chilts> sashman: socket.io is never a must-have, neither is any other module, depends what you want to do
21:19 < raj> how come in a fresh virtualenv with --no-site-packages, I can still do `node --version` and get a version spit out?
21:19 -!- mode/#node.js [+o piscisaureus_] by ChanServ
21:27 < raj> how is such a popular framework so quiet?
21:28 < bnoordhuis> raj: we're all busy writing awesome software
21:28 < raj> :)
21:29 < raj> so more of a king of the hill type of deal, not let me help you to the top?
21:29 < raj> :)
21:29 < raj> wait, =P is more appropriate
21:29 < gildean> also it's almost midnight and i should get to bed
21:43 < q_no> /ev.c:2676: ev_io_start: Assertion `("libev: ev_io_start called with negative fd", fd >= 0) - does anyone have clue what's causing this? trying to connect to mysql. node 0.8.15 / mariasql 0.1.9
21:43 < q_no> 0.8.14  ^^ :)
21:46 < clever> q_no: it sounds like the socket it tried to open failed, so it got -1 back
21:47 < clever> q_no: then it blindly tried to start doing io on file handle -1
21:47 < clever> and rather then blow up, the assert caught it and told you so
21:48 < robinson_k> what are you using for integration tests of your apps?
21:49 < robinson_k> i am trying to test for a flash-message after a redirect on express
21:53 < robinson_k> used superagent with persisting agent for it.
22:01 < springmeyer> seeing a few leaks (as reported by valgrind), anyone have a sense if these are normal?
22:01 < springmeyer> https://github.com/developmentseed/node-blend/issues/15
22:10 < Cheery> yay!
22:10 < Cheery> I've got 95% of webgl covered now
22:10 < Cheery> it might bug and have errors in it.
22:11 < Cheery> but I think it's at certain valuable milestone now
22:11 < tnorris> Cheery: still going at it, huh?
22:11 < Cheery> of course!
22:11 < marshall_> hey node
22:11 < Cheery> you'd expect me to give up? ^^
22:12 < Cheery> I'm just getting started up
22:12 < sashman> y cant i start redis-server i installed the npm
22:12 < marshall_> has anybody tried to use everyauth to make api calls to linkedin?
22:16 < tnorris> Cheery: heh, nope. but it is quite the undertaking you've accomplished in relatively short time.
22:17 < Cheery> tnorris: and it's just a start. ;)
22:21 < Cheery> tnorris: I think I'll implement the process-specific pieces and then start working on tutorials.
22:21 < Cheery> it's about time. and I'll fill the remaining functions while at it.
22:21 < Cheery> I'll try to produce tutorial series that covers the use of every and each function
22:24 < regality> taterbase: pics. now.
22:24 < regality> oops, wrong channel
22:24 < regality> srry
22:37 < tnorris> Cheery: sounds good. i'm looking forward to trying it out (but have to beat assassin's creed 3 first)
22:47 < MI6> joyent/node: Frederico Silva master * cfbfaaa : build: let gyp choose msvs version - http://git.io/FM4lGg
22:59 < astropirate> Hello Node.js people
23:03 < aandy> hello astropirate 
23:03 < astropirate> Hello!
23:05 < aandy> how're you doing. no #sandy ?
23:06 < mscdex> hello!
23:10 < EhevuTov> mscdex, hi. I was reading your xfer code(studying about binary data in JS) you magnificent son of a? 
23:10 < aandy> astropirate is typing message.... MUST BE A BIG ONE
23:10 < aandy> i miss the msn days
23:15 < mscdex> EhevuTov: wha? :-D
23:17 < EhevuTov> mscdex, I'm just being silly. I was studying your xfer module for binary data. I've been studying BER packing because it's hard for type'ed C mind to grasp in JS
23:17 < mscdex> oh
23:18 < EhevuTov> mscdex, I was wanting to write a SNMP trap generator module in Node until my boss redirected me to something else
23:18 < aandy> well, not completely silly. mscdex is a magnifiant son of something
23:18 < mscdex> he's a good man
23:18 < mscdex> SNMP is terrible
23:18 < EhevuTov> nah, it's just BER packing
23:20 < mscdex> EhevuTov: well it's more than that. security issues being one of those other problems
23:20 < EhevuTov> mscdex, oh, right.
23:21 < EhevuTov> mscdex, although I haven't studied much on SNMP v3 and it's security.
23:22 < mscdex> well snmp v3 is certainly the one to choose because it allows actual encryption
23:22 < mscdex> but lots of stuff out there now still only use v1 or v2 in plaintext
23:23 < EhevuTov> mostly 2c
23:24 < EhevuTov> anyone using node-gyp for a non Node.js add-on project? I'd like to know if I should go down this route. I'm looking at just regular gyp as well, or even boost.build
23:25 < TooTallNate> EhevuTov: you probably want just regular gyp
23:26 < mscdex> gyperrific!
23:26 < EhevuTov> TooTallNate, ok. I'm assuming there's a way to make make 'gyp' make standard makefiles rather than Xcode projects on my Mac, right? I'm not finding anything glaring in the documentation that allows me to switch easily.
23:27 < EhevuTov> It seems to autodetect
23:27 < TooTallNate> EhevuTov: invoke gyp with "-f make"
23:27 < tmpvar> creationix, you around?
23:28 < EhevuTov> ah, thanks. I figured it was something like that. I couldn't find the table describing the formats
23:29 < sashman> do i need to run redis-server to use it as sessionstorage?
23:29 < EhevuTov> sashman, I don't use it, but I'd assume you need to start up redis in order to use it
23:30 < vicapow> hey all! just (offiailly) launched a little side project written in node + express. check out at http://clickb.in
23:30 < sashman> so var redis= require redis starts it ?
23:30 < tjholowaychuk> vicapow: saw the github issue :D looks sweet
23:30 < vicapow> tjholowaychuk: thanks man!
23:30 < tjholowaychuk> first bootstrap thing
23:30 < tjholowaychuk> that actually looks nice
23:30 < tjholowaychuk> haha
23:31 < EhevuTov> vicapow, congrats. Looks good.
23:31 < vicapow> also. http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4725161
23:31 < vicapow> :P
23:31 < vicapow> EhevuTov: thank you!
23:31 < vicapow> tjholowaychuk: also uses node-canvas for the icons
23:32 < EhevuTov> sashman, I'd assume you need to start redis outside of Node all together. Once you start redis up and you confirm it's working, you can then try to connect to redis within a Node program
23:33 < sashman> mh ok sry but im wondering cause i installed redis but the cmd redis-server is still not available 
23:35 < raj> in doing `npm install -g testacular`, I get a series of errors, beginning with `error: not found: testacular@''`
23:35 < EhevuTov> sashman, maybe it's not in your PATH. do a 'find / -name redis-server'
23:36 < EhevuTov> each time I see 'testacular', I see 'testicular'
23:37 <@Nexxy> you would.
23:37 <@Nexxy> EhevuTov, fun fact: the tagline for testacular used to be "the test runner with balls" but I complained and the author changed it.
23:37 < EhevuTov> LOL
23:38 < EhevuTov> Nexxy, keepin' us on the straight and narrow
23:38 <@Nexxy> hah, I can't do anything straight
23:38 < EhevuTov> LOL
23:38 < jrajav> Not if you're so concerned with balls, no
23:39 <@Nexxy> yes I'm very concerned.
23:39 <@Nexxy> I just thought it was juvenile
23:39 < nlf> Nexxy: don't know if you've been using my protobuf library at all yet, but i'm working on some more optimizing for it now
23:39 <@Nexxy> nlf, I actually haven't but you're making me want to try it
23:39 <@Nexxy> have you benchmarked it against http much?
23:40 < nlf> a little
23:40 <@Nexxy> real wins?
23:40 < nlf> i did a benchmark that did 10,000 gets of a small json object
23:40 < nlf> little over 27 seconds with my http library
23:40 < nlf> 8.5 with the protobuf one
23:40 <@Nexxy> ooh
23:40 <@Nexxy> interesting
23:40 < EhevuTov> that's significant
23:41 < nlf> yeah, it's definitely an improvement
23:41 < nlf> i'm working on the varint encoding/decoding methods now
23:41 < EhevuTov> that's almost the speed of a transactional database running on one machine doing constant inserts
23:41 < nlf> they're not as efficient as they could be, should be able to squeak some more speed out of that
23:42 < nlf> i just discovered that bit shifting and writing bytes directly to a buffer is faster than using .writeUInt32BE by quite a bit
23:42 < EhevuTov> for the record, when I was doing benchmarking on inserts to a database (I think it was the InnoDB engine) I was getting like 8k rows/sec
23:43 < EhevuTov> nlf, yeah, stuff like that frustrate me about runtimes. I can't easily tell what they're optimized for
23:47 < EhevuTov> Nexxy, what's is the topic about?
23:47 <@Nexxy> I have no clue
23:48 <@Nexxy> isaacs set it
23:48 <@Nexxy> he might have a better idea ;P
23:48 < EhevuTov> oh that explains it. I think he's been neckbearding lately
23:50 < taterbase> Nickebearding, I like it
23:50 < EhevuTov> taterbase, what's that
23:51 < taterbase> Sorry I meant Neckbearding, like you mentioned earlier
23:51 < EhevuTov> ah, thought he was listening to Nickelback and hacking out the new streams
23:51 < taterbase> No, but that should be a thing
23:52 < EhevuTov> It's his favorite band I hear
23:52 < willhig> Hey, does anyone here have experience using passport?
23:52 < EhevuTov> I use it in one of my projects, but not much different than what the examples teach
23:52 < willhig> Sure, I've been following the examples.
23:52 < willhig> At least I thought I have…
23:53 < EhevuTov> not working?
23:53 < EhevuTov> where's your code
23:53 < willhig> When it gets to passport.authenticate, Heroku times out.
23:53 < willhig> Lemme check it in so you can see it.
23:53 < taterbase> nickleback.on('genericAltRock', function(err, garbage){});
23:54 < EhevuTov> I actually like some Nickelback on occasion
23:55 < jocafa> careful, you can get klined for saying something like that
23:55 < taterbase> I used to, until they kept telling me to look at this photograph.
23:55 < EhevuTov> ROTFL
23:55 < willhig> 'kay: https://github.com/thure/baxter-app
23:57 < willhig> If I post to /login, "Trying to log in!", but then I get Error H12 (Request timeout) -> POST
23:57 < willhig> *"Trying to log in!" is logged,
23:57 < EhevuTov> willhig, does it happen right away? Have you tried it locally?
23:57 < willhig> I haven't tried it locally, no.
23:59 < willhig> hm… weird… it's timing out on my machine too.
23:59 < willhig> maybe this has something to do with the database?
