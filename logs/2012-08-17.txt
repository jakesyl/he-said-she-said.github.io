00:00 < ccowan> Zebra12: I thought odesk looked pretty spammy too... When I asked how he filters out the crap the above was his repsonse
00:03 < RLa> i think i have found about half of my projects through irc :)
00:04 < ccowan> Zebra12: Are you looking for work or looking to hire?
00:04 < ccowan> I guess I should have asked that before I wrote so much :D
00:05 < RLa> ah, he left
00:06 < ccowan> RLa: oh... I must have bored him away... :)
00:06 < littlebear> ccowan: lol
00:07 < Zebra12> looking to hire
00:07 < RLa> btw, i like that technique of selecting candidates
00:07 < ccowan> It think it would work for just about any system
00:07 < ccowan> https://github.com/Agilevent/rails-job-application
00:08 < ccowan> That's one of his repos
00:09 < RLa> odesk is one of those bidding sites, you post a project and select bid?
00:09 < RLa> i have heard some people having problems with those
00:10 < ccowan> I thought there was a way to just hire people too
00:10 < RLa> and lot of freelancers do not like such sites because lowest bidder gets often selected
00:10 < ccowan> I haven't used it yet but I'm going to have to start looking some help soon
00:11 < mscdex> node.js rules!
00:11 < The_Fly> agreed!
00:11 < ccowan> yeah... that's one issue with bidding sites like that
00:11 < ccowan> My buddy doesn't pick the lowest... just the most competent.
00:12 < RLa> and there are always people who live with parents, have no family to feed and do not care about taxes
00:12 < RLa> so someone can always bid lower
00:12 < ccowan> Oh... the joys of being young :D (as my kids are bugging me to go play Portal 2 so they can watch)... gotta run :D
00:13 < The_Fly> haha
00:49 < tprice> hey what does "EXDEV, rename \'/tmp/fe9f0b8cfe10bfc87fa0f4ba18db421a\'" mean?
00:51 <@konobi> tprice: try googling for EXDEV and errno
00:52 < tomshreds> Hey guys, let's say I have a a bin specified in my package.json. This will only be available if installed globally right? Is there anyway of using it if installed in the project only? thanks
00:53 <@konobi> add ./bin/ to your $PATH
00:54 < tomshreds> but I'll have to do it for each and every project ?
00:54 <@konobi> tomshreds: nope... just "./bin/"
00:55 < tomshreds> but let's say my bin lead to cli.js and not to something in bin/?
00:56 <@konobi> it's a shell expansion... it'll use ./bin/ relative to whereever you currently are
00:56 < tomshreds> ok right thx
00:56 < tomshreds> but hum. let's say I'm in test/ and the package is in test/node_modules/mypackage then the exec will be in test/node_modules/mypackage/bin so it wont work?
00:57 <@konobi> test/bin/
01:07 < TooTallNate> tomshreds: make that "./node_modules/.bin" to your $PATH
01:07 < TooTallNate> my favorite little tweak :)
01:08 < tomshreds> oh interesting! thanks for this
01:14 < bwen> is it possible to have npm git a dependency that is in a private git repo directly by the clone url? or am I missing something...
01:16 <@isaacs> tprice: it means you tried to mv a file across device boundaries.
01:16 <@isaacs> tprice: that doesn't work
01:17 < tprice> isaacs thank i found out im just read write stream then pipe it
01:17 <@isaacs> bwen: "dependencies":{"foo":"git+ssh://git@github.com:user/private.git"}
01:20 < bwen> isaacs: has to be a github repo? 
01:20 <@isaacs> bwen: can be anything
01:20 <@isaacs> doesn't have to be github
01:20 <@isaacs> git+ssh://<user>@<hostname><path>#<commit-ish>
01:20 <@isaacs> or git+https://etc
01:20 <@isaacs> or git://
01:21 < bwen> when I just had "test": "ssh://user@git.domain.com/srv/git/name" I got no errors but did not check it out
01:21 < bwen> when I added git+ssh
01:21 < bwen> I got a bunch of errors saying it was not in the npm repo and it prefixed with 0.1.0
01:22 <@isaacs> gist your actual package.json file
01:22 < tprice> isaacs while your around im working on a project that has modules  to it. i want to install all 4 at once with npm. how do i go about doing that? should i make a 5th project and install the toher 4 with that one?
01:23 < bwen> https://gist.github.com/3375116
01:23 < bwen> its the exact ssh:// i use to clone it locally
01:26 < timeturner> can we be sure that npm is safe to use for our own private repos?
01:27 < bwen> what do you mean?
01:27 < timeturner> I mean it won't publish to npmjs or anything like that will it?
01:28 < bwen> thats not how it works
01:28 <@konobi> timeturner: you can add stuff to npmrc to enforce that
01:29 < timeturner> ah I see the options now
01:29 < timeturner> should have read those before haha
01:29 < timeturner> sweet this will work
01:37 < bwen> it does check it out propery in my ~/tmp/npm- but still gives me a 404 and doesnt move it to my node_modules ...
01:45 < bwen> I can put dashs in the package name: "" right?
01:45 < chilts> bwen: yep, there are many such as connect-* ... I have one called connect-stream-s3 for example :)
01:46 < bwen> hmm aight..
01:48 < bwen> so my problem isnt that its not cloning the private git repo properly but its because it still checks with https://registry.npmjs.org/packagename/version for it and ultimately does not move it from the ~/tmp/npm-* to my node_modules
02:01 < Init--WithStyle-> Hey guys, for parsing .png pixel data into a data structure, would graphics magick be a good driver to use?
02:02 <@isaacs> bwen: you need the git+ssh://
02:02 <@isaacs> bwen: npm doesn't know that ssh:// means git
02:03 < Init--WithStyle-> Is "parsing" pixel data the correct term to be using?
02:03 <@isaacs> bwen: that url (without the git+) works with git, because git DOES know that you're using git ;)
02:03 < Init--WithStyle-> For some reason google/stackoverflow don't turn up any tutorials on how to do so...
02:04 <@isaacs> bwen: so, when npm sees "ssh://blahblahblha", it says, "This is not a valid version number, and it's not a git url, so it must be a tagged version"
02:04 <@isaacs> bwen: then it doesn't see that version tag, complains, and gives you the defautl version instead
02:04 < bwen> isaacs: yeah I put it back and it does clone it correctly in ~/tmp/npm-* but still verifies with registry.npmjs.org and ofcourse it gives a 404 and then it doesnt move it in node_modules
02:06 < bwen> I never published it and had no intention of doing that...
02:18 < bwen> any way to have npm NOT verify with the registry if its a private git repo and we dont want to publish to the registry.npmjs.org ?
02:19 <@isaacs> bwen: it works for me
02:19 <@isaacs> bwen: with git+ssh/
02:19 <@isaacs> it doesn't fetch the package from the registry then
02:19 <@isaacs> what npm version you using?
02:20 < bwen> 1.1.36
02:20 < dominictarr> bwen, put "private" : true in your package.json I thing
02:20 < dominictarr> k
02:20 < bwen> want to see the gist npm-debug ?
02:20 < bwen> dominictarr: I did but thats not its intended use...
02:26 < bwen> isaacs: https://gist.github.com/3375396 It did the clone properly... why does it have to check it against the npm registry?
02:27 < tprice> im using npm programmatically how do i stop it from loggin to the console?
02:29 < Determinist> isaacs: you wrote the node-service-* stuff for joyent, right?
02:34 < Determinist> https://gist.github.com/ee5f91f063f5db05a604 <-- this is driving me insane and I can't debug this because it's not going all the way back into any module or my code that I can debug.
02:34 < Determinist> my server keeps crashing for no apparent reason with this error every now and then
02:43 < bwen> any way to have npm NOT verify with the registry if its a private git repo and we dont want to publish to the registry.npmjs.org ? ( know putting private: true in the package will avoid accidently publish to the npm repo. But it does not prevent npm from checking my private package name against it when I do npm update)
02:44 <@konobi> bwen: npmmini?
02:44 < bwen> ok I think I figured it out
02:45 <@Nexxy> konobi, that's really great
02:45 <@Nexxy> konobi, I've been wanting something exactly like this for a while
02:45 <@konobi> Nexxy: ruh-roh
02:45 <@Nexxy> do you need a scooby snack?
02:45 <@konobi> that means i have to support shit... dammit
02:45 <@Nexxy> I will do my best to complain via PR
02:45 <@Nexxy> :)
02:45 <@konobi> Nexxy: patches welcome =0)
02:46 <@konobi> PR?
02:46 <@Nexxy> pull request
02:46 <@konobi> ah... yup
02:46 < bwen> when I do: npm install package-name it does check it out property and move it into node_modules. But when you do: npm update package-name it checks it againts the npmjs repo and doesnt move it to the node_modules folder although it cloned correctly in the ~/tmp/npm-*
02:47 < innociv__> I'm trying set up monit to stop a script when it uses too much cpu. "sudo /bin/bash -c '/bin/kill -15 `cat /var/run/messenger.pid`'" works to stop it but stop program  = "/bin/bash -c '/bin/kill -15 `cat /var/run/messenger.pid`'" in monit config isn't working. Even when I "sudo monit stop all" it doesn't stop it.
02:47 < bwen> npm update package-name works as intended once you "npm install package-name". :)
02:48 <@konobi> Nexxy: so, iirc, it should work for public/private repo too
03:02 <@konobi> Nexxy: now available for parties, clown school and other amazing consulting opportunies
03:02 <@konobi> =0P
03:08 <@Nexxy> konobi, I've always wanted to go to clown school
03:09 -!- mode/#Node.js [+o piscisaureus_] by ChanServ
03:10 < rvagg> konobi: npmmini! nice, surprisingly small too.
03:14 < rvagg> when you need a more serious storage backend for it konobi, rvagg/node-levelup will be perfect for it
03:17 <@konobi> rvagg: hard disks are easy
03:21 <@konobi> Nexxy: for what use-case, btw?
03:28 <@Nexxy> konobi, being good at making people laugh
03:28 <@Nexxy> I think that's pretty much the only use case for clown school
03:30 <@konobi> Nexxy: heh... i meant for npmmini
03:31 <@Nexxy> konobi, ohh
03:31 <@Nexxy> konobi, just deploying to commodity hardware without npm as a dependency
03:32 <@Nexxy> npm registry*
03:38 <@konobi> Nexxy: ah... kk
03:39 < innociv__> I'm trying set up monit to stop a node.js script when it uses too much cpu. "sudo /bin/bash -c '/bin/kill -15 `cat /var/run/messenger.pid`'" works to stop it but stop program  = "/bin/bash -c '/bin/kill -15 `cat /var/run/messenger.pid`'" in monit config isn't working. Even when I "sudo monit stop all" it doesn't stop it.
04:04 < pringlescan> Is anyone on 0.9.x? Felix's MySQL stopped working for me on 0.8.4x, I upgraded it to the alpha and now it doesn't escape unicode and numbers come up NaN.
04:07 < rvagg> ouch, I guess that's why it's alpha, I saw he was having issues with unicode but I don't think it was about that particularly
04:07 < rvagg> best bet would be to open an issue on node-mysql to discuss it
04:16 < jerrysv> indexzero: ping?
04:17 < natasha> looking for an experienced node developer for a CTO position with a tech startup. looking for a developer located in the US, but the position is remote. please PM me if interested
04:22 < jesusabdullah> natasha: Where are you based?
04:22 < Init--WithStyle-> natasha: good to see people looking for quality devs here.. tired of the whole "fire off a million ads" method :)
04:22 < darwinwang> Hi, all . I have a problem at configure & make
04:23 < jesusabdullah> Init--WithStyle-: finding a reasonably good dev can be hard!
04:23 < jesusabdullah> darwinwang: what *kind* of problem?
04:23 < natasha> I'm located in South Florida.
04:23 < jerrysv> jesusabdullah: are you any good with winston?
04:23 < darwinwang> make[1]: *** Ã»ÓÐ¹æÔò¿ÉÒÔ´´½¨¡°/data/home/darwinwang/node-v0.8.7/out/Release/obj.target/deps/v8/tools/gyp/libv8_base.a¡±ÐèÒªµÄÄ¿±ê¡°/data/home/darwinwang/node-v0.8.7/out/Release/obj.target/v8_base/gen/debug-support.o¡
04:23 < jesusabdullah> jerrysv: Reasonably so
04:23 < jesusabdullah> darwinwang: What is that text mess
04:23 < jesusabdullah> ಠ_ಠ
04:23 < jesusabdullah> darwinwang: use gist.github.com brah
04:24 < jesusabdullah> natasha: oh dang, I was gonna say if you were in sfbay or nyc you should just go to some js events and try to meet some peeps
04:24 < natasha> Init--WithStyle- : figure this would be one of the best places to find the best :)
04:24 < jerrysv> jesusabdullah: and laurie and i are hitting oakland in a just over a week, would love to meet up and hack if you are interested - need to track down substack, marak, maxogden, and mikeal as well
04:24 < Init--WithStyle-> natasha: this and also places like stack overflow imo
04:24 < Init--WithStyle-> people interested in learning through teaching others are usually the best
04:24 < natasha> Yeah, being in South Florida definitely limits me, only one node.js group and it isn't even active on meetup
04:24 < jerrysv> jesusabdullah: i'm doing a query() and seem to only be getting back 10 results - wondering if this is the default? and how to override it?
04:24 <@Nexxy> natasha, still? ._.
04:25 < jerrysv> Nexxy: not everywhere is as cool as here :)
04:25 < Lorentz> sydney's pretty cool
04:25 < jesusabdullah> jerrysv: I believe you should be able to set that as an argument for query but I've heard of that being promblematic. I'd look at the query implementation for your backend directly, I bet it's not huge
04:25 < Lorentz> how's it hanging sydneyers?
04:25 <@Nexxy> jerrysv, I suppose that's true
04:25 < natasha> @Nexxy: yeppp those bacon cheeseburgers still on the table ;) haha
04:25 < jesusabdullah> Hard to be **cooler** thyan fairbanks alaska! ohohoho
04:26 < jerrysv> Nexxy: olynode on tuesday? i'm presenting on node in really small places
04:26 <@Nexxy> natasha, you forgot the most important part
04:26 <@Nexxy> jerrysv, wat
04:26 < natasha> vegan
04:26 <@Nexxy> natasha, thank you <3
04:26 < natasha> how could I forget!!!
04:26 <@Nexxy> YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ME
04:26 < jesusabdullah> HOW DID YOU KNOW??!?!
04:26 <@Nexxy> el oh el
04:26 < jesusabdullah> nexxy it's your wife! RUN
04:26 < jerrysv> jesusabdullah: aha! rows or limit
04:26 <@Nexxy> jesusabdullah, no!
04:26 <@Nexxy> different natasha ;P
04:26 < jesusabdullah> ;)
04:26 <@Nexxy> mine is sitting next to me lol
04:27 < jesusabdullah> well yeah, your tash doesn't live in Phlorida neither
04:27 <@Nexxy> thankfully
04:27 < jesusabdullah> yeah, like, a week of Orlando was enough for me
04:27 < jesusabdullah> space center rocks though
04:28 < natasha> where are you from jesusabdullah?
04:28 < jerrysv> Nexxy: they invited me up, figure i'm still on vacation so might as well
04:28 < jesusabdullah> I'm in oakland right now natasha but originally from alaska (hence the "can't get much cooler" joke)
04:28 < jesusabdullah> lived in squarebanks for like 5 years or so :)
04:28 < natasha> gotcha.. how do you like oakland?
04:28 <@Nexxy> jerrysv, oh, cool!
04:29 < jesusabdullah> not my gig tbh, but I also live in a rough neighborhood
04:29 < jerrysv> Nexxy: taking up some hardware - i have room for one in the car, laurie isn't going, if you're interested in a road trip?
04:29 < jesusabdullah> natasha: Do you have node chops? Since you were asking about a technical executive posish I have to ask
04:30 < jesusabdullah> natasha: If you do, I recommend hacking up a prototype
04:30 < jesusabdullah> natasha: If you don't, I recommend trying to hack up a prototype anyway (you just might have to try a few more times)
04:31  * jesusabdullah tries to remember how substack met pkrumins
04:31 < jesusabdullah> perlcats I think
04:31 < natasha> jesusabdullah: unfortunately i'm not technical, i'm in the process of learning but not anywhere enough to hack together a prototype as of now atleast
04:32 < natasha> my forte is more on the business side, but i am very curious on learning the development side
04:32 < AAA_awright> I think crypto is changing it's behavior on me
04:32 < AAA_awright> Anyone know what's going on here?
04:32 < dominictarr> natasha, are you SURE you arn't technical. you ARE on irc. evidently.
04:32 < AAA_awright> What changed?
04:32 < AAA_awright> I don't recall any change in behavior
04:32 < natasha> dominictarr: technical to a certain extent, smart enough to research where i need to go to immerse myself in the community ;)
04:33 < dominictarr> indeed
04:33 < andy23> is there a good way to execute multiple mysql queries inside an event? I have 6 queries I want to execute after one event occurs, but it is getting pretty messy trying to use callbacks
04:33 < jesusabdullah> dominictarr: That's what I'm saying ;)
04:34 < dominictarr> technical people are always impressed my business people who can be technical.
04:34 < rvagg> andy23: try caolan/async on github if you're getting tied up in callbacks and call order
04:34 < rvagg> npm install async
04:35 < andy23> rvagg: i'll check it out
04:35 < jesusabdullah> natasha: dominic's right. If you can get so far as to fake it you'll get crazy mad props
04:35 < dominictarr> programming is mostly just copy and paste anyway. 
04:35 < dominictarr> it's easy
04:35 < natasha> fake it till you make it haha
04:35 < jesusabdullah> yup :)
04:35 < natasha> should that be the new mantra
04:35 < natasha> hahah
04:36 < jesusabdullah> Don't worry, most of us are noobs you'll catch up in like 5 minutes ;)
04:36 <@Nexxy> how did I get here i am not good with computer
04:36 <@konobi> what does github "star" mean anyways?
04:36 <@Nexxy> bookmark
04:37 < dominictarr> konobi, means you are famous and get to eat no brown m&ms
04:37 < natasha> where are you from dominictarr?
04:37 < dominictarr> new zealand
04:37 < natasha> nice
04:37 < timeturner> star vs watch
04:37 < timeturner> I like watch better
04:37 <@konobi> ah
04:38 <@konobi> the new "watch:
04:38 < dominictarr> natasha, you?
04:38 < jerrysv> dominictarr: copy/paste === cargo cult programming
04:38 < timeturner> yeah
04:38 < jesusabdullah> I hate starring shit
04:38 < dominictarr> cargo cult X = copy/paste
04:38 < jesusabdullah> I refuse to do it
04:38 <@Nexxy> you'd rather get spammed with all of the commits?
04:38 < jesusabdullah> ah, but there's copy and pasting **while knowing what it means**
04:38 < jesusabdullah> I'd rather only follow projects I actually give a shit about
04:38 < jesusabdullah> :)
04:39 < jerrysv> jesusabdullah: that is more rare
04:39 < natasha> i'm currently in south florida
04:39 < jesusabdullah> Come to the bay, it's not as warm but oaklandish sells hoodies
04:39 < substack> dominictarr: http://partialobjects.com/2012/01/generating-dubstep-from-one-line-of-code/
04:39 < jerrysv> substack: beer in 2 weeks?
04:39 < dominictarr> substack, good timing.
04:39 < substack> jerrysv: sure
04:40 < jerrysv> substack: awesome :)
04:40 < dominictarr> just cloning baudio to play with while travelling today.
04:40 < substack> dominictarr: I'm finding that piping to play is better than using aplay
04:40 < substack> play is part of sox
04:41 < natasha> I would gladly leave the heat of Florida during the summer, soo brutal
04:41 < dominictarr> give me short list of thing to get installed fast. there isn't much time.
04:41 < substack> install sox
04:41 < substack> that is all you need
04:42 < dominictarr> npm install sox -g ?
04:42 < substack> sudo apt-get install sox
04:42 < dominictarr> right
04:42 < substack> in fact
04:43 < substack> ode -e 'for(t=0;;t++){process.stdout.write(new Buffer([t*(t^t+(t>>15|1)^(t-1280^t)>>10)]))}' | play -t s8 -
04:43 < dominictarr> installed
04:43 < substack> node -e 'for(t=0;;t++){process.stdout.write(new Buffer([t*(t^t+(t>>15|1)^(t-1280^t)>>10)]))}' | play -t s8 -
04:44 < myndzi> i'm putting together a fairly simple web app (game), but i absolutely hate fiddling with css
04:44 < jesusabdullah> me too myndzi
04:44 < myndzi> i tried out twitter bootstrap and it seemed to have some handy stuff
04:44 < dominictarr> substack, awesome.
04:44 < myndzi> but 1) it has like 12 jquery plugins and jquery too, which i'd like to avoid
04:45 < jesusabdullah> I'm a terrible web programmer, don't have a designing bone in my body
04:45 < myndzi> 2) for some godawful reason the password input  box is not the same style as the username input box
04:45 < jesusabdullah> I'd just use the css without the js stuff myndzi, that's how *I* roll
04:45 < jesusabdullah> Oh, yeah, well
04:45 < jesusabdullah> bootstrap has a few promblems here and there
04:45 < jesusabdullah> even aside from those
04:45 < jesusabdullah> it's like 85% sane default though
04:45 < myndzi> so the question is, is there a bundle that's LIGHT that i can snag with some stuff
04:45 < jesusabdullah> Yeah, there are other "css frameworks" out there with varying levels of weight
04:46 < myndzi> i don't seem to find any with the real handy parts i want :(
04:46 < myndzi> like the nav bar
04:46 < myndzi> and modal boxes
04:46 < myndzi> maybe these contradict 'light' ;)
04:46 < myndzi> i really don't wanna do em myself though
04:47 < AAA_awright> pbkdf is outputting keys of a different length than what I ask for
04:47 < AAA_awright> Uh, some help please?
04:47 < AAA_awright> WHo broke crypto
04:48 < myndzi> are you specifying it in bits or bytes? :P
04:49 < AAA_awright> It's returning a string like 12% longer than what I ask for
04:49 < AAA_awright> And it's operating differently since last revision
04:49 < AAA_awright> I can't login because of this
04:50 < AAA_awright> This absolutely needs to work 100% reliably
04:50 < AAA_awright> Cryptography in general needs to be predictable (even if the input isn't)
04:51 < Lorentz> crypto is hard
04:51 < AAA_awright> Where's bnordhis when you need him
04:54 < AAA_awright> There needs to be a pbkdf2Sync function...
04:54 < myndzi> 1/8 = 12,5
04:54 < myndzi> you're specifying bits but it's intrpreting bytes
04:54 < myndzi> specify the length in bytes
04:58 < dominictarr> substack, so I guess that bitshifting expression is some type of cellular automaton.
04:58 < AAA_awright> myndzi: No, +12% longer
04:59 < AAA_awright> or shorter?
04:59 < AAA_awright> Like, 130 bytes instead of 100
04:59 < AAA_awright> It's bizarre
04:59 < AAA_awright> And pbkdf2 is failing against the test vectors
04:59 < AAA_awright> That's REALLY BAD
05:00 < AAA_awright> require('crypto').pbkdf2('password', 'salt', 1, 20, function(err,v){ console.log('\n%s', Buffer(v).toString('hex')); }) // this should be returning 0c60c80f961f0e71f3a9b524af6012062fe037a6
05:00 < AAA_awright> Per http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6070
05:01 < ChrisPartridge> AAA_awright: What version of node are you on?
05:01 < AAA_awright> master branch
05:02  * AAA_awright pulls again just to be sure
05:04 < ChrisPartridge> AAA_awright: Ah ok, working fine with v0.8.1
05:05 < AAA_awright> Are there any tests in Node.js for crypto?
05:06 < AAA_awright> Ok yeah
05:06 < ChrisPartridge> AAA_awright: https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/test/simple/test-crypto.js
05:08 < AAA_awright> Alright, the code I should be using is:
05:08 < AAA_awright> require('crypto').pbkdf2('password', 'salt', 1, 20, function(err,v){ console.log('\n%s', Buffer(v,'binary').toString('hex')); }) // this should be returning 0c60c80f961f0e71f3a9b524af6012062fe037a6
05:09 < AAA_awright> Man when is crypto going to get Buffer support
05:09 < AAA_awright> This is insane
05:10 < jesusabdullah> AAA_awright: ADD IT. ADD IT NOW.
05:17 < AAA_awright> Now I'm getting keys of the right length, but not what I'm expecting, hm
05:18 < AAA_awright> I can only imagine the behavior of parsing salts changed :-\
05:27 < adlwalrus> anyone in here know about compiled jade templates?
05:29 < mape> adlwalrus: look at adding client:true when you compile the templates
05:33 < mape> jade.compile(template, {client: true, compileDebug: false}).toString();
05:42 < AAA_awright> adlwalrus: A little bit
05:42 < adlwalrus> mape: i'm quite new to node-jade.
05:42 < adlwalrus> oh hi, AAA_awright, thanks.
05:43 < adlwalrus> so i'm creating an embedded script that's supposed to inject content onto its host page programmatically upon certain conditions being true.
05:43 < AAA_awright> It needs a cat
05:44 < adlwalrus> and i want the transport to be optimally efficient.
05:44 < AAA_awright> I think Jade, unlike some other of his stuff, was designed to be sent down to the browser
05:45 < AAA_awright> adlwalrus: So you're looking for client-compiled code?
05:45 < AAA_awright> I think mape posted the solution
05:45 < AAA_awright> Or rather, server-compiled for-the-browser
05:56 < adlwalrus> well i'm not serving by jade.
05:56 < adlwalrus> i'm just serving static js files.
05:56 < adlwalrus> sorry s/jade/node
05:57 < adlwalrus> but i need efficient transport to the client since my content is being delivered as a 3rd party script.
05:57 < adlwalrus> so i want to be considerate of the performance of the other peoples' sites that i'll be getting embedded on.
05:58 < adlwalrus> AAA_awright: i guess i don't really know what i'm looking for, other than just some open ended feedback and suggestions for how to go about this.
05:59 < AAA_awright> adlwalrus: You're probably going to have to dig through the Jade source (it's the ultimate documentation!), and start serving dynamicly generated, statically cached Javascript
06:00 < adlwalrus> I mean, since the Jade syntax has less overhead, I figure it would be a more performant delivery mechanism.
06:00 < adlwalrus> It's unwieldly and unmaintainable to keep my content as document.write'd HTML.
06:01 < AAA_awright> You want to use Jade client-side?
06:02 < AAA_awright> You can either use Jade as a browser-side library, use Jade to render a javascript Function server-side and pass that to the client, or render the template server side and pass HTML to the client
06:03 < mape> adlwalrus: guess it depends on how much jade you are gonna send, it has to be quite a lot to make up for the jade lib in size
06:04 < adlwalrus> what would the function do though if i go the second route? that's what i've been having trouble figuring out in my googlings.
06:04 < adlwalrus> mape: i see.
06:04 < adlwalrus> what's "quite alot"
06:04 < adlwalrus> ?
06:04 < adlwalrus> what'dyou think the threshold would be, give or take?
06:15  * Nexxy hides the booze
06:17 < shoshy> i'm getting "[ERROR] TypeError TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'on' " on var io = require('socket.io').listen(http); (if i remove the listen it won't scream for error), when using the regular express boilerplate... don't have a clue why... :/ any ideas?
06:17 < shoshy> even if i add "io.sockets.on('connection', function (socket) {" .. afterwords it won't matter... 
06:19 < shoshy> found out the problem..
06:19 < shoshy> should change listen(http) to listen(app) .. wierd. Saw examples with just the opposite
06:25 < shoshy> nope... its not that.. 
06:25 < shoshy> baa
06:29 < shoshy> found out , how to solve it.. need to put the http server creation in a varible and pass that. Instead of the var http = require('http') ; 
06:31 < mape> adlwalrus: check the kb size of the jade lib and then check the template size (both gziped) and you should have you answer
06:33 < chakrit> shoshy: i assume you've just updated express to 3.0
06:33 < chakrit> ?
06:34 < chakrit> shoshy: express app no longer inherits from http.Server in 3.0
06:34 < SomeoneWeird> express3 is a PITA to get working with socketio
06:34 < deoxxa> bah, no it's not
06:35 < deoxxa> var app = express(), server = http.createServer(app), io_server = io.listen(server);
06:39 < JZA> hi I wonder how to install mongojs with the /usr/lib/node/node_modules/ prefix instead of /home/user/node_modules/
06:40 < JZA> does npm install at the current location
06:40 < shoshy> deoxxa: right.. that was my error.. thing is examples on the web aren't that updated
06:40 < shoshy> i want to use handlebars as the templating engine (client + server-side) , its hard to find a good updated gist, any links?
06:41 < shoshy> i saw https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/ , but not sure how to use it really (his code examples looks like more client side rather than server side)
06:42 < JZA> ok I read the local vs global and suggested the following:
06:43 < JZA> Whether to install a package globally or locally depends on the global config, which is aliased to the -g command line switch.
06:43 < JZA> anyone let me know where can I find the config file?
06:43 < JZA> is it /etc/node?
06:43 < deoxxa> JZA: slow down
06:44 < adlwalrus> mape: cool, thx.
06:44 < deoxxa> JZA: why are you installing that module globally?
06:44 < JZA> cuz I dont need it on my ~
06:44 < deoxxa> JZA: that's not an answer. why are you installing it globally?
06:45 < JZA> that's where all my node packages are, I am just trying to run a a tutorial on mongojs
06:45 < JZA> and I would probably use it again
06:45 < deoxxa> they shouldn't be there
06:45 < deoxxa> you should be installing packages like that with your project
06:46 < deoxxa> do you know about the package.json file?
06:46 < JZA> deoxxa: I know it was pulled by npm. 
06:46 < deoxxa> i'm going to take that as a "no"
06:47 < deoxxa> http://docs.nodejitsu.com/articles/getting-started/npm/what-is-the-file-package-json
06:47 < deoxxa> read that
06:47 < JZA> deoxxa: I got a warning from it, btw npm WARN package.json bson@0.1.1 No README.md file found!
06:48 < deoxxa> that's an npm bug, don't worry about it for now
06:48  * deoxxa taps isaacs
06:48 < hongymagic> or even: http://package.json.jit.su/
06:48 <@Nexxy> deoxxa, that's a bson bug!
06:48 <@Nexxy> no README.md!
06:48 < yawnt> yo deoxxa 
06:48 < deoxxa> ner ner
06:49 < deoxxa> sup yawnt
06:49 < yawnt> just woke up
06:50 < deoxxa> Nexxy: is it documented behaviour for npm to require a readme.md upon -installation- of a package?
06:50 < deoxxa> i could almost understand if it was required (or warned about) on publishing the package
06:50 < deoxxa> but installation?
06:50 < JZA> deoxxa: so package json looks like META-INF 
06:50 <@Nexxy> lol yeah
06:50 < JZA> a declaratory file for the package manager.
06:51 < deoxxa> JZA: somewhat, yep
06:51 < yawnt> uh yay
06:51 < yawnt> new follower on github
06:52 < jesusabdullah> deoxxa: it's just a warning right? :)
06:52  * Nexxy unfollows yawnt to make up for it
06:52 < deoxxa> jesusabdullah: but it makes newcomers scared :<
06:52 < yawnt> Nexxy: >:(
06:52 <@Nexxy> yawnt, hey you unfollowed me first!
06:52 < yawnt> Nexxy: on twitter
06:53  * Nexxy crosses arms
06:53 < JZA> deoxxa: so what does that has to do with mongojs locally vs globally? Is it because of file permissions over the datasources?
06:53 < yawnt> just because you were spamming my timeline with HURR DURR YOU BAD GU
06:53 < yawnt> *GU
06:53 < yawnt> *GU
06:53 < JZA> deoxxa: it needs to go locally
06:53 < yawnt> *GUY
06:53 <@Nexxy> not true at all
06:53 < yawnt> hey my Y doesnt work
06:53 < jesusabdullah> well you ARE
06:53 < yawnt> :|
06:53 < yawnt> Nexxy: to creationix 
06:53 < yawnt> yes it's true
06:53 < deoxxa> JZA: it's about installing things properly, so you don't end up in "dependency hell"
06:53 <@Nexxy> creationix and I were coming to an understanding with each other ;P
06:53 < yawnt> there, followed again
06:53 < yawnt> you happy Nexxy 
06:53 <@Nexxy> maybe
06:53 < yawnt> >:(
06:53 < JZA> ok
06:54 < deoxxa> JZA: also npm makes things really easy for you if you use package.json properly - it means you can just do `npm install' in your project directory and get all the right packages
06:54 < yawnt> don't you dare unfollowing me on twitter.. now that i reached the impressive number of 23 followers
06:54 < yawnt> *github
06:54 <@Nexxy> I refollowed
06:54 < jesusabdullah> hah
06:54 < yawnt> twitter is 1 hundred something

06:54 <@Nexxy> lewl
06:54 < yawnt> 23 please
06:54 < jesusabdullah> I actually have no idea how many followers on grithub I have
06:55 < jesusabdullah> I have ~450 on twatter
06:55 < yawnt> don't ruin my happyness, i've never had 23 followers on GH
06:55 < yawnt> IM FAMOUS
06:55 < jesusabdullah> "but what of it? It is a vacuous truth." --the null set
06:55 < jQuy_> How to use Connect with restify?
06:55 < yawnt> jesusabdullah: yeah but you work @ nodejitsu
06:55 <@Nexxy> can i aks a question?
06:55 < yawnt> depends
06:55 < jesusabdullah> God damn it what is this "starring" bullshit I *followed* thise repos
06:55 < yawnt> is it about penguins?
06:55 < jesusabdullah> those*
06:55 < jesusabdullah> I should unfollow some
06:55 < jQuy_> I can't get my front end page index.html as visible
06:55 < yawnt> jesusabdullah: don't follow
06:56 < yawnt> trust me
06:56 < yawnt> dont
06:56 < jesusabdullah> er, unstar
06:56 < yawnt> i'm getting travis bot emailing me
06:56 < jesusabdullah> unstar the shit out of everything
06:56 <@Nexxy> what is the problem with starring?
06:56 <@Nexxy> stars = no commit spam, amirite?
06:56 < yawnt> when pull requests on resourceful fail
06:56 < yawnt> WHO CARES
06:56 < jesusabdullah> it's a popularity contest
06:56 < yawnt> i only want commits
06:56 <@Nexxy> but I like to bookmark things
06:56 <@Nexxy> so I don't forget about them
06:56 < yawnt> i star too
06:56 <@Nexxy> when I dont' care about the commits
06:56 < yawnt> but i want to see new commits
06:56 < yawnt> without getting spamm'd
06:56 < yawnt> the old watch was working so well
06:57 < yawnt> i'm hating gh now
06:57 < yawnt> :(
06:57 <@Nexxy> I don't like the email spam
06:57 < yawnt> neither do i
06:57 <@Nexxy> but I like the separation of watch + star
06:57 < yawnt> if there was no email spam
06:57 < yawnt> i'd too
06:57 < yawnt> but, there is
06:57 <@Nexxy> let's all complain @github
06:57 < yawnt> yep
06:57 <@Nexxy> I think isaacs already did
06:57 < yawnt> #OpGithub
06:57 < yawnt> #anonymous-nodejs
06:58 < jesusabdullah> well
06:58 < jesusabdullah> at least I'm following fewer people now
06:58 < yawnt> follow me on github
06:58 < yawnt> nao
06:58 < yawnt> :(
06:59 < jesusabdullah> show me
06:59 < jesusabdullah> and I will decide if you qualify ;)
07:00 < yawnt> lol
07:00 < yawnt> github.com/yawnt
07:00 < deoxxa> https://github.com/deoxxa
07:00 < deoxxa> yawnt: i notice you're not following me
07:00 < jesusabdullah> I'm not following a ton of people, mostly nodejitsuka and a few other oddballs
07:00 < deoxxa> i'm now following you :3
07:00 < jesusabdullah> like that fent dude
07:00 < yawnt> deoxxa: am i
07:00 < yawnt> i thought i was
07:00 < yawnt> fi'x
07:00 < yawnt> *fix'd
07:00 < jesusabdullah> and heather arf
07:01 < yawnt> wat
07:01 < yawnt> heather arf?
07:02 < jesusabdullah> heather arthur
07:02 < jesusabdullah> y'know, brain.js ?
07:02 < yawnt> yeah yeah
07:02 < jesusabdullah> So, does https://github.com/yawnt/imago work?
07:02 < yawnt> i just didn't know arf was arthur
07:02 < yawnt> think so, last time i checked it did
07:02 < jesusabdullah> arf arf :)
07:03 < yawnt> ideally i should bind part of qt to nodejs
07:03 < yawnt> so i can take screenshots as native modules
07:03 < yawnt> i'm using something really weird in that module
07:03 < yawnt> but qt (even shrinked) would probably take too much to compile on nodejitsu
07:03 <@Nexxy> wow https://github.com/gjohnson/coffeefilter
07:04 <@Nexxy> ilol'd
07:04 < jesusabdullah> yawnt: I'd go with something lower level, like surely there's a way to take a screenshot using X alone?
07:05 < yawnt> jesusabdullah: ofc but i can't do that on nodejitsu can I?
07:05 < jesusabdullah> yeah, that's a different promblem altogether
07:05 < yawnt> yep imago works jesusabdullah 
07:06 < deoxxa> Nexxy: lel
07:06 < jesusabdullah> yawnt: how u imago?
07:06 < yawnt> jesusabdullah: you mean how i take a shot?
07:07 < yawnt> browserjet.. it's a think wrapper around webkit, but the guy who did it made it messed up npm pretty badly
07:07 < jQuy_> Hi! I'd like to use Restify with Connect static file server. Can somebody help me?
07:07 < yawnt> so it wont install anywhere except for vps or localhost
07:08 < yawnt> that's also my worst project you picked jesusabdullah 
07:08 < jQuy_> I get an error: XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://localhost:8080/test/. Request header field X-Requested-With is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Headers.
07:08 < yawnt> well that and Rgit prolly, but that's kinda useful at least
07:09 < jesusabdullah> yawnt: yar
07:10 < yawnt> jesusabdullah: yar? 
07:10 < yawnt> why you speaking so weird today
07:10 < yawnt> :(
07:13 < jQuy_> Have someone used Connect - static file server?
07:13 < duko> why is ie8's JScript faster when ie8 is in compatibility view?
07:13 < duko> does anyone know?
07:17 < sorin7486> anybody know a simple way to make file uploads from node.js (to another server) ?
07:19 < DTrejo> pirates yawnt
07:20 < jesusabdullah> haha, this is funny
07:21 < jesusabdullah> all these fucking python projects I don't give a shit about anymore
07:21 < jesusabdullah> *unstar*
07:21 < ChrisPartridge> isn't talk like a pirate day in sep. ?
07:21 < jesusabdullah> I'll talk like a pirate whenever the fuck
07:21 < ChrisPartridge> :o
07:22 < yawnt> DTrejo: =
07:24 < jesusabdullah> unstar *all* the python projects!
07:24 < yawnt> lol
07:24 < yawnt> i'm going crazy
07:24 < yawnt> i rea
07:24 < yawnt> *read
07:24 < yawnt> "deoxxa started following deoxxa"
07:25 < yawnt> Nexxy: you two have too x-s .. cut out some
07:25 < deoxxa> heh
07:25 < jesusabdullah> Wow, I have a lot of shit projects here
07:25 < yawnt> so $.ready(function()) doesn't work anymoar
07:25 < yawnt> cool
07:25 < jesusabdullah> a *lot*
07:25 < jesusabdullah> I guess that's okay
07:28 <@xyxne> ._.
07:32 < sorin7486> where's the like button on this thing?
07:41 < yawnt> it'd be so cool to have a bootstrap for metro ui
07:41 < yawnt> the ones i've seen are far from complete
07:41 < yawnt> metro all the web
07:44 <@xyxne> yawnt, you're tripping
07:44 < yawnt> why
07:44 <@xyxne> metro is absolute garbage
07:45 < deoxxa> also it's not metro anymore
07:45 < deoxxa> just fyi you two
07:45 < yawnt> yeah i know
07:45 < yawnt> but i like metro
07:57 < jQuy_> How can I server static files? I have MongoDB running and Restify in use.
07:57 < jQuy_> If someone could help me...
07:57 <@xyxne> jQuy_, http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/static.html
07:58 < jQuy_> @xyxne: thanks... I'll check that out.
07:59 <@xyxne> jQuy_, :)
08:00 -!- mode/#Node.js [+o Nexxy] by ChanServ
08:01 < jQuy_> @xyxne: I'm a rookie and I'm not sure how many server do I need. One restify server (f ex. localhost:8080) and one Connect server for static files (f ex. localhost:8888) ???
08:03 <@Nexxy> jQuy_, that would probably be the cleanest solution
08:04 <@Nexxy> jQuy_, in production you could also just use subdomains to route the requests to the appropriate app
08:04 < jQuy_> @Nexxy: but then there is a BIG problem.
08:05 < jQuy_> @Nexxy: I can't fetch data from another server and port
08:05 < jQuy_> @Nexxy: I get an error: XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://localhost:8080/test/. Request header field X-Requested-With is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Headers.
08:06 < jQuy_> @Nexxy: and I don't know how to handle that error
08:06 < jQuy_> @Nexxy: it's a show stopper
08:07 < shanse> pasting that error into your favourite search engine might provide some insight
08:07 < deoxxa> https://www.google.com/search?q=restify+static+files
08:07 < deoxxa> not even kidding
08:07 < deoxxa> first damn result
08:08 < shanse> that too
08:09 < deoxxa> jQuy_: you sound stressed. slow down and think through the problem a bit next time, ask questions instead of telling us everything is broken.
08:10 < jQuy_> deoxxa: thanks for the advice
08:11 < deoxxa> jQuy_: everyone here is happy to help, but it's easier when you're asking questions :)
08:11 < jQuy_> deoxxa: ok
08:14 < evelyette> hi
08:14 < evelyette> when writing node.js code on the server side, can that code be seen by the clients when viewing the source code of the page ?
08:14 < evelyette> I guess it shouldn't be, but I rather ask
08:15 < chakrit> no
08:15 < chakrit> unless you have a misconfigured static files middleware, no
08:15 <@Nexxy> or if you've placed your server-side files inside the static directory
08:15 < evelyette> by no, you mean that it isn't vissible ?
08:15 < chakrit> it isn't visible
08:15 < evelyette> cool
08:15 < evelyette> thank you
08:16 < chakrit> you send clients the html content (assuming you use express)
08:16 < chakrit> not your scripts
08:16 < deoxxa> chakrit: or WAP if you have an early 2000s nokia phone!
08:16 < deoxxa> wap was a serious failure...

08:27 < jorgster> if a node 0.8.7 make goes into a loop trying to access the same file /tmp/makerjs_5d2a55b871bb93b2313e which does not exist again and again, is it node.js's fault or the software I'm trying to build?
08:27 < deoxxa> jorgster: sounds like something to do with "makerjs"
08:28 < lz> jorgster it depends how you're trying to access that file
08:28 < lz> how are you?
08:29 < jorgster> I'm just executing "node make generic". It was using 100% cpu so I did a strace to figure out what was going on.
08:29 < jacobat> Hi all. I've installed docco with "nom install docco" but the binary is not added to my path, and it doesn't seem to work. I'm totally new to npm so I'm probably missing something obvious.
08:29 < jacobat> Any ideas how to get docco to work?
08:29 < chakrit> npm install -g docco
08:30 < chakrit> jacobat: if you need something installed to your $PATH you add the `-g` option to install it globally.
08:30 < jacobat> chakrit: That solves the binary problem, but it's still failing though
08:30 < jacobat> chakrit: Alright, I just thought you could have it link it to a local binary folder
08:31 < deoxxa> jacobat: you can
08:31 < deoxxa> jacobat: if you use `npm config set prefix /some/prefix'
08:32 < jacobat> deoxxa: That would set the global prefix?
08:32 < deoxxa> jacobat: for example i use `npm config set prefix /home/deoxxa/local', then i have ${HOME}/local/bin in my path
08:32 < deoxxa> that changes where things are installed to when you use -g, yes
08:32 < jacobat> cool, thanks
08:32 < deoxxa> actually let me confirm that's the right setting
08:32 < deoxxa> haha
08:32 < deoxxa> one second
08:32 < jacobat> :)
08:32 < deoxxa> yeah, prefix
08:33 < deoxxa> you can use `npm config ls -l' to see all the config options available to you
08:33 < lz> jorgster, do you have the same issue w/ earlier versions of node?
08:33 < jacobat> deoxxa: Thanks
08:33 < deoxxa> no problem \o/
08:33 < rvagg> or you can just sudo npm install -g <package> like a REAL MAN
08:33 < jorgster> lz: no, worked before. But I don't remember what version that was. Strace give error 7 which seems to mean E2BIG. [pid  8762] open("/tmp/makerjs_2ddaf7743387f9a592ba", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) = 7
08:34 < rvagg> jorgster: a gist might be helpful on deciding 'fault'
08:34 < jorgster> err nevermind.. it returns file descriptor 7  (;
08:34 < lz> jorgster, I would try the node dev discussion group then, and roll back versions until it works
08:35 < jorgster> ok thanks
08:35 < deoxxa> rvagg: sissy - REAL real men just `chown -R 777 /' and don't have to sudo for anything
08:36 < rvagg> ya, ok, I'll stop short of that
08:37 < deoxxa> also they set their UID to 4294967295 so nobody else can have a larger one
08:37 < rvagg> heh
08:37 < rvagg> I prefer just to work as 0 fulltime
08:37 < deoxxa> i wonder how much software that would break
08:38 < lz> real men have a uid of 0
08:38 < deoxxa> soooo
08:38 < deoxxa> just signed up for an app.net account
08:38 < deoxxa> i wonder if that was a mistake
08:39 < rvagg> $50?
08:39 < jesusabdullah> wtf is app.net?
08:39 < deoxxa> mmm
08:39 < deoxxa> $50 twitter
08:39 < deoxxa> pretty much
08:39 < rvagg> jesusabdullah: where have you been???
08:39 < deoxxa> i wonder if i'll feel compelled to interact more with it now that it's costing me moneys
08:39 < rvagg> likely
08:40 < jesusabdullah> rvagg: around?
08:40 < rvagg> i.e. to not know about app.net
08:40 < jesusabdullah> rvagg: I guess I thought "app.net" sounded like two buzzwords in one
08:40 < jesusabdullah> so I wasn't about to visit their website
08:40 < rvagg> it's that too
08:41 < lz> yea.. app.net is a horrible name
08:41 < rvagg> open, social, kickstart, user-centric, buzzwordtastic
08:41 < deoxxa> but it's a network application
08:41 < deoxxa> so it's perfectly named!!!!
08:42 < jesusabdullah> ಠ_ಠ
08:42 < rvagg> but.... is it written in .net, I hope not
08:42 < deoxxa> oh dear
08:42 < deoxxa> now i feel like i donated to the KKK
08:42 < rvagg> branch is pretty interesting, been some neat threads on there
08:43 < rvagg> I have access but I have nothing of significance to post
08:43 < deoxxa> rvagg: cat pictures
08:43 < deoxxa> always a good choice
08:43 < SomeoneWeird> lol
08:44 < rvagg> ya, didn't take long for this one to be hijacked by a gif: http://branch.com/b/thinking-differently-about-web-publishing
08:44 < rvagg> that's a quality gif tho, if I was into collecting them
08:45 < milani> lol
08:47 < maritz> that entire thread seems like a giant circle-jerk with buzzwords oO
08:47 < rvagg> ya, read-write-web know-it-alls talking buzzwords
08:48 < rvagg> this one is perhaps more interesting: http://branch.com/b/is-content-elitism-the-answer-to-online-publishing-s-woes
08:49 < deoxxa> what's the deal with the crappy url
08:49 < deoxxa> what is "b" meant to mean?
08:49 < deoxxa> don't people realise that the first thing people see of your content is usually the url?
08:49 < rvagg> 'branch' I guess..
08:49 < rvagg>  /u/ might be for user settings
08:50 < deoxxa> what, "discussion" was too long?
08:50 < rvagg> I guess it gives them the ability to reserve the root namespace for other stuff
08:50 < rvagg> like http://branch.com/featured
08:50 <@maxogden> i like substance.io AND it is open source AND it runs on node
08:50 < rvagg> ya, talk to Google about URLs, they've got it all figured out...... or not
08:50 < deoxxa> ha
08:50 < deoxxa> google code - /p/
08:50 < deoxxa> thanks guys!
08:51  * deoxxa hates ugly urls
08:51 < maritz> is_not_branch_discussion_thread_url____ = url.indexOf('-') !== -1
08:51 < maritz> :P
08:51 < nonuby> how can I connect to a self-signed tls endpoint using tls.connect(opts) these doesnt seem to be a disableVerify option (or something that) resulting in an auth error of depth_zero_self_signed_cert
09:01 < rvagg> hah, substance.io is pretty neat, very ambitious for an open project
09:02 < rvagg> as is prose.io which I've never seen before but is apparently related
09:03 < rvagg> oh yes! prose.io, now that's the way to edit your README.md
09:04 < deoxxa> all these .io websites are very pretty
09:04 < deoxxa> ooh that is nice
09:11 < deoxxa> rvagg: i think i might actually use prose.io - it's pretty darn nice
09:11 < deoxxa> i wonder if it lets you make directories...
09:19 < rvagg> I wish it did syntax highlighting too, but I can get by without
09:29 < shoshy> im trying to use handlebars as the templat engine and i keep getting: Error: ENOENT, open 'c:\...\ default.handlebars' , despite using: app.set('view options', { layout: false });
09:30 < deoxxa> shoshy: what version of express?
09:30 < shoshy> 3.0.0rc2
09:31 < yawnt> shoshy: layout isn't available anymore in express > 3.0
09:31 < deoxxa> ok, there's no more layout stuff in 3.x
09:31 < yawnt> deoxxa: ^ see how good i am
09:31 < yawnt> \ò/
09:31 < deoxxa> oooh
09:31 < deoxxa> \o/
09:31 < deoxxa> https://github.com/visionmedia/express/wiki/Migrating-from-2.x-to-3.x
09:31 < yawnt> ahahaah
09:31 < yawnt> damn
09:31 < yawnt> you win this time
09:31 < deoxxa> check that out, shoshy
09:32 < yawnt> i'll code an irssi script that matches "template express layout"
09:32 < yawnt> and beat you every single time
09:32 < deoxxa> thanks, chrome history search, for allowing me to stick it to yawnt this one time
09:32 < yawnt> :(
09:32 < yawnt> i was still partying for my victory
09:32 < deoxxa> ha
09:32 < yawnt> that i haven't thought of migration
09:32 < shoshy> ok, thanks... guys
09:32 < shoshy> :)
09:32 < shoshy> i guess it's the lib i'm using for handlebars
09:32 < shoshy> which isn't hbs..
09:33 < yawnt> use consolidate.js
09:33 < shoshy> is outdated..
09:33 < yawnt> it has handlebars support
09:33 < yawnt> (via hbs actually, but still)
09:33 < shoshy> yawnt: thanks, that's cool
09:33 < shoshy> looks good
09:33 < yawnt> shoshy: thank deoxxa 
09:33 < yawnt> oh you mean consolidate
09:33 < yawnt> lol
09:33 < shoshy> thanks deoxxa
09:33 < yawnt> np
09:33 < yawnt> :P
09:33 < shoshy> :)
09:33 < shoshy> both..
09:34 < shoshy> :)
09:34 < deoxxa> you can thank me anyway!
09:34  * deoxxa loves attention
09:34 < yawnt> NO!
09:34 < deoxxa> :<
09:34 < shoshy> do you guys can recommend any SQL driver that isn't ORM , but won't lock me to specific DB?
09:34 < yawnt> :(
09:34 < yawnt> i'm developing an ORM right now
09:34 < yawnt> for SQL
09:34 < yawnt> :(
09:34 < deoxxa> hmm, i use mostly mongodb
09:34 < shoshy> so if i'm using mysql and postreSQL, and i might switch from one to the other... but i don't want to be locked, there isn't any...
09:35 < yawnt> shoshy: driver none that i can think of
09:35 < deoxxa> there's jugglingdb
09:35 < yawnt> odm there's https://github.com/flatiron/resourceful
09:35 < shoshy> i see... i know theres' http://www.sequelizejs.com/ is ORM
09:35 < deoxxa> it does that a little bit
09:35 < yawnt> deoxxa: that's an orm
09:35 < deoxxa> oh
09:35 < yawnt> shoshy: there's also mine
09:35 < yawnt> github.com/yawnt/hater
09:35 < deoxxa> a driver that isn't orm
09:35  * deoxxa derp
09:35 < yawnt> *SPAM* *SPAM*
09:35 < deoxxa> yay for self promotion!
09:36 < shoshy> hahah
09:36 < shoshy> :)
09:36 < shoshy> yea, but i'm not after an ORM solution ... :/
09:36 < shoshy> those kind of stuff should be in the core of node.js for better support ..
09:36 < deoxxa> mmmm i don't know about that
09:36 < traph> is there a good article for structuring an app?
09:37 < sorin7486> yawnt, that's the best project evah :))
09:37 < yawnt> sorin7486: oh well it's like in active dev
09:37 < yawnt> when i say active i mean REALLY active
09:37 < yawnt> so there's a lot of stuff to iron out
09:37 < yawnt> but it works :D
09:37 < shoshy> yawnt: i liked the diva horse you got there
09:37 < shoshy> :)
09:37 < yawnt> :P
09:37 < yawnt> rainbow dash ftw
09:37 < shoshy> he got attitude

09:44 < yawnt> mac ideally
09:44 < shoshy> you guys got a good recommendation for facebook connect example using node? one that works and is updated (There are a lot of libs out there but they aren't updated that often)
09:44 < yawnt> but $$$

10:09 < metal55> Hello all, are there any jade people here?
10:10 < metal55> I was wondering if anyone could tell me how (or even if it was possible) to use a mixin variable as part of a class name within a jade template
10:10 < bnoordhuis> metal55: you probably want #express
10:10 < metal55> bnoordhuis: ahh cool, yep they use jade for express don't they
10:11 < metal55> thanks
10:11 < SomeoneWeird> jade != express
10:11 < bnoordhuis> my pleasure :)
10:11 < metal55> agreed jade != express but they do use it
10:15 < jQuy> How can I use Restify server and Connect server from separate files? Right now I only have one file and two server implementations.
10:16 < jQuy> Is it possible to include another server file via Restify server?`
10:17 < metal55> if there was anyone here the knows jade, I created a paste bin to help describe my question http://pastebin.com/qWz3N02x
10:34 < deoxxa> hm
10:34 < deoxxa> i wonder if music on github would work
10:34 < deoxxa> working on a piece of music at the moment, and it seems to me that as long as the person wanting to collaborate on it had the same applications as i do, it would work fine...
10:35 < deoxxa> maybe the time it takes to merge etc would make it awkward
10:35 < SomeoneWeird> you mean pushing it to github?
10:35 < deoxxa> yeah
10:35 < deoxxa> the project files
10:35 < SomeoneWeird> it'd work, dunno how easy it'd be though
10:35 < SomeoneWeird> you can push anything to git :p
10:45 < deltab> maybe sparkleshare would help
10:45 < deoxxa> perhaps
10:46 < deoxxa> oh great
10:46 < deoxxa> now my housemate's daughter decides she wants to practice keyboard
10:46 < deoxxa> greaaaaat timing
10:46 < bentkus> man, how does that npm install work on local packages :/
10:47 < bentkus> it simply does nothing
10:49 < yawnt> keyboard?
10:49 < yawnt> how can someone practice keyboard :|
10:50 < chakrit> metal55: not sure but isn't that mixin syntax suppose to be used like a js function?
10:50 < yawnt> http://ihave50dollars.com/
10:50 < yawnt> i'm dying
10:50 < yawnt> hahahah epic.
10:51 < tasslehoff> yawnt: a musical one, perhaps :)
10:51 < chakrit> metal55: `mixin("hello")` not `mixin(hello)` iirc (the latter just uses the value of the hello variable)
10:51 < yawnt> tasslehoff: oh didn't know they had the same name
10:52 < yawnt> seems legit though, it's the same also in italian
10:58 < tasslehoff> yawnt: yeah. we use 'keyboard' for both in norway too
10:59 < yawnt> uh norway
10:59 < yawnt> cool place
11:00 < tasslehoff> yep, can be pretty cold up here :p
11:02 < yawnt> i feel so cool
11:02 < yawnt> models.Link.find({where: { user: { id: id } }, fetch: ["tags", "user"]}, function(e, docs) {
11:02 < yawnt> TAKE THAT SEQUELIZE
11:04 < jQuy> How can I attach multiple server side js-files into my application?
11:05 < jQuy> I have one file with two server implementation and I would like to separate them.
11:06 < cole_> exit
11:09 < rovar> has anyone implemented erlang style atoms or ruby's symbols for javascript?
11:10 < rovar> or node, rather
11:23 < jQuy> Do I have to write all server side code into one javascript file or can I separate it?
11:24 < bnoordhuis> jQuy: you can separate it. look at the docs for require()
11:24 < jQuy> bnoordhuis: thanks
11:26 < jQuy> bnoordhuis: I thought that require is for node packages
11:35 < bnoordhuis> jQuy: require() is for including other files, possibly packages
11:36 < jQuy> bnoordhuis: you helped me a lot :)
11:36 < bnoordhuis> my pleasure :)
11:36 < jQuy> bnoordhuis: I'm setting up my file structure now

12:20 < maritz> yawnt: even if i use my cell phone for a ping in a rather remote area, it'll still beat usain bolt easily...
12:21 < mscdex> The challenge has begun!
12:22 < deoxxa> mscdex: which challenge?
12:22 < mscdex> maritz' challenge
12:22 < bentkus> hypocracy
12:23 < mscdex> bolt.js
12:23 < mscdex> someone make it!
12:23 < deoxxa> you sane?!
12:23 < deoxxa> sorry i'll see myself out
12:25 < yawnt> uhm
12:26 < yawnt> hey maritz !
12:26 < yawnt> maritz: i had to tell you something yesterday but i forgot .(
12:28 < bentkus> tommorow you will forget that you wanted to tell him something
12:29 < yawnt> deoxxa: https://github.com/visionmedia/express/pull/1290 I AM SO FUNNY
12:30 < yawnt> bentkus: probably
12:33 < maritz> yawnt: great, now i'm going to die, not knowing what you wanted to tell me yesterday. you ass.
12:34 < yawnt> maritz: probably was something like
12:34 < yawnt> HAHAH COFFESCRIPT
12:34 < yawnt> *COFFEE
12:35 < yawnt> im out
12:35 < yawnt> laer
12:35 < yawnt> *later
12:51 < tasslehoff> anyone got an updated example of parsing a multipart stream?
12:53 < AndreasMadsen> Why dose .. ['1', '2'].map(parseInt) not work
12:53 < AndreasMadsen> .. ['1', '2'].map(parseInt)
12:53 < mscdex> tasslehoff: node-formidable?
12:53 < AndreasMadsen> it returns  1, NaN ]
12:53 < AndreasMadsen> it returns  [1, NaN ]
12:54 < mscdex> AndreasMadsen: because map() passes multiple arguments
12:54 < mscdex> and parseInt takes multiple arguments
12:54 < mscdex> the first being the value, the second being the base
12:55 < mscdex> so it's probably setting an invalid base
12:55 < tasslehoff> mscdex: no idea what to use, really. threw out bodyParser from my express-app, and am trying to figure out how to do the work myself
12:56 < AndreasMadsen> mscdex: ahh, yes cool
12:56 < mscdex> tasslehoff: why?
12:56 -!- mode/#Node.js [+o piscisaureus_] by ChanServ
12:58 < tasslehoff> mscdex: because I want to control that the uploaded file is not too big.
13:07 < mscdex> tasslehoff: well, bodyParser uses node-formidable under the hood, but maybe bodyParser doesn't provide access to that level
13:08 < mscdex> tasslehoff: you could always use node-formidable manually, with bodyParser disabled
13:09 < tasslehoff> mscdex: just started googling it :) I believe that is a good idea.
13:09 < rvagg> LevelUP v0.0.0 is now in npm, w00t! If anyone wants to try a new Node LevelDB binding you should give it a whirl: https://github.com/rvagg/node-levelup
13:11 < deoxxa> rvagg: leveldb is just plain old key/value, right?
13:11 < rvagg> not just plain old!
13:11 < rvagg> but yea, it's key/valye
13:11 < deoxxa> heh
13:11 < deoxxa> awesome
13:11 < rvagg> where both key and value can be arbitrary byte strings
13:11 < deoxxa> i might give that a spin right now
13:11 < rvagg> it's super-fast and it has compression baked in
13:11 < deoxxa> yeah
13:11 < SomeoneWeird> faster than redis?
13:11 < deoxxa> is there an in-memory option?
13:12 < rvagg> no, it's for on-disk
13:12 < deoxxa> ok
13:12 < deoxxa> that's fine too, just wondering
13:12 < rvagg> riak have been messing with using LevelDB as a storage back-end, not sure where they are with that
13:14 < MerlinDMC> rvagg, leveldb is the default storage backend
13:16 < deoxxa> rvagg: is there a way to check if a key exists without fetching the data?
13:18 < rvagg> deoxxa: no, just do a get
13:18 < deoxxa> i'm being difficult! yay!
13:18 < rvagg> MerlinDMC: oh, it is the default now, cool
13:18 < rvagg> deoxxa: I've considered a `has()` or something but it'd just be a get anyway
13:19 < deoxxa> true
13:23 < rvagg> although, I may yet implement something like that cause it'd be more efficient to discard the value at the native layer rather than passing it up through V8
13:23 < SomeoneWeird> true
13:24 < rvagg> anyway, `night ppl
13:24 < SomeoneWeird> gn
13:36 < RobZ1> I upgraded my app to 0.8.7 and now getting a Unhandled 'error' event in the createServer call.  Did the api change?
13:41 < _smf_> RobZ1: what error is reported?
13:41 < _smf_> And what version of node were you using?
13:41 < RobZ1> _smf_: throw arguments[1]; // Unhandled 'error' event
13:41 < RobZ1> _smf_: 0.8.7
13:42 < _smf_> I meant before 0.8.7
13:42 < RobZ1> _smf_: 0.8.6
13:43 < _smf_> Ok - what does the rest of the stack trace show
13:43 < RobZ1> _smf_: I'll gist it, one sec
13:43 < solidoodlesuppor> Hey, can anyone help me out with a node.js irc bot?
13:44 < RobZ1> _smf_: https://gist.github.com/8e53c7e8c3a1f719572a
13:45 < solidoodlesuppor> https://gist.github.com/996827
13:45 < RobZ1> _smf_: doh
13:45 < RobZ1> _smf_: I'm an idiot
13:45 < _smf_> LOL
13:45 < _smf_> You still have another server running?
13:45 < solidoodlesuppor> Having a little trouble figuring out how to make it listen for user messages
13:46 < RobZ1> _smf_: yeah, a friggin rails app I was working on today.  sorry to waste your time.
13:47 < _smf_> RobZ1:  no problemo; sometimes it helps just to go through stuff with someone else like this.   
13:47 < RobZ1> _smf_: yeah :)  ty
13:48 < jrajav> solidoodlesuppor: Just use Jerk and be happy
13:49 < solidoodlesuppor> Jerk?
13:49 < jrajav> solidoodlesuppor: https://github.com/gf3/Jerk/
13:49 < jrajav> If you still want to roll your own, that will at least help you get started
13:49 < jrajav> Or one of gf3's other frameworks
13:49 < solidoodlesuppor> well that's a lot more clear 
13:50 < jrajav> Yup. Pretty sweet eh?
13:50 < solidoodlesuppor> I wouldn't feel as bad ass using it though. Is it wrong to take the easy route?
13:51 < jrajav> require('jerk')( function(j) { j.watch_for('ping', function(m) { m.say( m.user + ": pong" ); }); } );

14:27 < prempillai> I'm trying to add an event emitter inside an express route on 'app'. For some reason, it keeps calling itself over and over, any ideas?
14:34 < maritz> damnit, require.js is driving me insane... :X
14:34 < maritz> yawnt: and it's your fault, i bet.
14:35 < maritz> prempillai: can you show us the code?
14:37 < prempillai> maritz: https://gist.github.com/9886e7cafb7d4e81739f
14:38 < yawnt> maritz: of course
14:38 < yawnt> i'm messin up with yo mind to drive you insane
14:38 < yawnt> IMMA BE MAGICIAN
14:38 < yawnt> meanwhile, in the hall of the super best friends
14:38 < yawnt> (cit. South Park)
14:39 < maritz> seriously though: i define something with a dependency and it's not a circular one, but the dep is still undefined -.-
14:39 < maritz> prempillai: that's coffeescript
14:39 < maritz> i can't read that, sorry.
14:39 < maritz> yawnt: DON'T SAY A WORD
14:39 < prempillai> @maritz, sorry, 
14:40 < prempillai> I'm sending it to you in JS
14:40 < maritz> prempillai: actually, i can. it's just not a good idea in general to ask for help with coffeescript because a lot of people might not be able to help you ;)
14:40 < prempillai> sure, https://gist.github.com/9886e7cafb7d4e81739f
14:41 < prempillai> @maritz thanks for the tip
14:41 < maritz> prempillai: so which events is firing itself again and again?
14:42 < yawnt> lol
14:42 < yawnt> compiled coffeescript
14:42 < maritz> :D
14:42 < yawnt> oh it's not compiled coffeescript
14:42 < yawnt> it'd have been hilarious
14:42 < yawnt> HERE HAVE SOME JS
14:43 < maritz> prempillai: just in general you might want to look at the async module to control such async flow, instead of throwing events around ;)
14:43 < maritz> yawnt: how do you figure it's not compiled cs?
14:43 < maritz> looks a lot like it is
14:44 < prempillai> @maritz, sure do you have a link to 'async'? a link to a quick example would be great. BTW, addPresentationToUser was getting called over and over for some reason
14:44 < maritz> github.com/caolan/async
14:45 < maritz> prempillai: in general the entire route seems to be very error prone. if for example User.findById returns null, the request will just hang there until it times out
14:46 < prempillai> @maritz, yes, I'll write some errorTraps for that later
14:47 < maritz> using async.waterfall or async.auto would be better though ;)
14:47 < prempillai> @maritz, sure, will take a look at it
14:48 < maritz> but from that code i can't quite figure out why addedPresentationToUser would be called more than twice per route call. (except of course if user.save calls the callback multiple times for some reason. no idea what user.save is from here ;) )
14:49 < maritz> prempillai: if you really want to find out (because for some reason you don't want to use async or are reaaaally curious) use a debugger to break every time the event is emitted and look at the stack.
14:50 < prempillai> @maritz, you mean link console.log?
14:51 < maritz> well, you could log a stacktrace every time. but i meant using a debugger :D
14:51 < prempillai> @maritz, what are my options for a debugger?
14:52 < maritz> if you're masochistic: command line (http://nodejs.org/api/debugger.html)
14:52 < maritz> others: node-inspector or cloud9
14:53 < maritz> or something like eclipse
14:53 < maritz> https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Using-Eclipse-as-Node-Applications-Debugger
14:54 < prempillai> @maritz, huh, you beat me to it :)
14:54 < prempillai> @maritz, anyways, thanks a ton for the help, power to you

14:57 < yawnt> HA!
15:26 < oren1> i am building a site similar to http://engineering.linkedin.com/ (blog + other content). should i build it with express or can i do that with node + some modules instead (similar to https://github.com/isaacs/npm-www)
15:27 < chrisjaure> oren1: i'd go with express
15:27 < oren1> chrisjaure: any specific reason?
15:28 < oren1> is there anything there i can't (easily) do with simple node modules?
15:28 < chrisjaure> oren1: i've contributed to npm-www (front-end) and it wasn't very fun, no standards
15:29 < pandemic> chrisjaure: you can do it without any module, but express just makes it way easier. any reason to NOT use express?
15:30 < oren1> pandemic: isn't express uses continuation passing style? i pass multiple functions and it will call each one when i call next?
15:30 < oren1> pandemic: also, express is using middlewares that seems to be controvertial and not needed in node world.
15:31 < pandemic> oren1: hmm, I guess I wasn't aware of any controversial issues with it.
15:32 < Taneem> im building a full site without express
15:32 < Taneem> i first learned express but then got rid of it so that i could understand what exactly was happening
15:32 < Taneem> its been great so far
15:32 < oren1> pandemic: i'll try to look for linkes. i know both Mikeal and isaacs don't encourage the usage of middlwares.
15:33 < oren1> Taneem: great. do u have some code samples somewhere?
15:33 < pandemic> oren1: thanks! :) I'd definitely like some more detail on that.
15:33 < Taneem> not yet, but you can see the front end work in progress here just to give you a sense of the scope
15:33 < Taneem> joylister.com
15:33 < oren1> any nodeup people here? you should dedicate an episode on middlewares!
15:34 < Taneem> this is abt 1 month of work and im not really a dev
15:34 < oren1> Taneem: nice landing page
15:35 < Taneem> ty. the only thing that I really shouldn't have built from scratch was probably the session manager which i plan on replacing with an existing module .. but apart from that i didn't miss express too much
15:35 < therealkoopa> Is there anythling like cluster-live that works for the native node cluster module?
15:35 < oren1> Taneem: what module are u planning to use?
15:36 < Taneem> no idea haha .. i just assume someone else has solved the problem better than me. probably whatever connect has? I don't know
15:36 < oren1> pandemic: https://github.com/mikeal/tako/pull/14   i'll try to find more stuff
15:36 < pandemic> oren1: thanks! :)
15:37 < oren1> "Remove middleware concept"
15:37 < pandemic> right
15:37 < pandemic> interesting, I actually liked using middleware
15:40 < oren1> pandemic: https://github.com/mikeal/tako/issues/13  "i'd rather rip all the middleware out. - we should just implement JSON support inline, it already requires specifial hooks outside of the "middleware" stuff."
15:41 < pandemic> interesting, thanks. :)
15:42 < oren1> pandemic: btw, tako using mapleTree, that the routing module i am using as well - https://github.com/mikeal/tako
15:42 < pandemic> yeah, i was checking it out now. :)
15:43 < oren1> pandemic: checkout my website template - https://github.com/oren/node-website-template
15:44 < pandemic> that's pretty cool
15:45 < pandemic> i'll have to dig into it a bit more when i have a moment. :)
15:45 < oren1> pandemic: feel free to clone/use and give me feedback. i plan to use it to build a cms-like site
15:45 < oren1> pandemic: it's based on isaacs approach
15:46 < pandemic> ore1: awesome. the only node.js CMS that I've seen so far is calipso. I'd like to see more options. :)
15:46 < oren1> pandemic: i don't think i'll build something generic. i think it will be just for my needs. but we'll see
15:46 < pandemic> gotcha :)
15:47 < oren1> do u think i can use reddis as my only db?
15:47 < pandemic> not sure, i've only used it for sessions
15:48 < pandemic> I've been using mongoDB a lot personally
15:48 < oren1> me too
15:48 < pandemic> http://mongohq.com/ has 512mb DBs for free
15:48 < oren1> but was curious if i can't use redis. can't redis store the data to the hard drive?
15:48 < pandemic> not sure, i've never tried that
15:49 < pandemic> oren1: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/redis-db/KRbTsJRaegk
15:50 < pandemic> maybe that answers your question?
16:04 < me_janis> hi, i want to write a module to access a microcontroller using a large commandset, there are 20 "set-functions" and nearly 20 "get-functions". (to get an understanding)… so i wrote a json file specifying the name and corresponding datatype of each function. now i want the module to export all these functions, without implementing them in the module. is there any possibility to do that?
16:05 < me_janis> i got an universal function, to handle them… but currently it gets the function name as a parameter.. i search for a way exporting them directly, without this function in between.
16:22 < zhodge> Getting an odd syntax error on a short script if anyone wants to take a look (https://gist.github.com/3380327)
16:23 < chrisjaure> zhodge: is the json you're trying to parse valid?
16:23 < jocafa> hipsterslapfight:  i giggle every time i scroll by your nick…  every. time.
16:24 < SomeoneWeird> zhodge, it might be reading \n and stuff too
16:25 < zhodge> chrisjaure: oh, anomaly found: lurking .ds_store in a sea of .json's 
16:26 < hipsters_> thank you jocafa 
16:26 < EricBlade> hey guys. i'm working with a service right now where I need to extract integer values from a binary buffer .. but the automatic conversions are beating me up a little bit.  is there a correct way to simply get the int val of a character in a buffer ?  
16:26 < hipsters_> oh btw hipsterslapfight is also me :v
16:27 < chrisjaure> zhodge: it's a good idea to wrap JSON.parse in a try/catch because it's pretty easy to cause errors
16:27 < SomeoneWeird> EricBlade, as in, ascii value?
16:28 < EricBlade> SomeoneWeird: yes, but without having it automatically deal with double-byte characters
16:30 < EricBlade> i'm expecting values between 0-255, and i'm getting 0-255 and 65533
16:30 < EricBlade> actually, i'm getting 0-127 and 65533
16:32 < zhodge> chrisjaure: I can see, yeah 
16:32 < zhodge> had to go digging to find it was JSON.parse causing the error
16:33 < zhodge> thanks by the way
16:34 < cronopio> zhodge: some ppl add a try/catch around JSON.parse for avoid the crash. or better just .filter the files array for *.json names
16:37 < oren1> pandemic: thanks!
16:41 < pandemic> oren1: I forgot what I did, but you are welcome regardless, haha!
16:47 < tommybergeron> Hi, I had a custom domain pointing to my jekyll blog. I switched the ownership of it and now it doesn't work anymore. Is there any steps to take for this? Thanks
16:48 < tommybergeron> I thought I'd post this here as well since we all use GitHub...
16:51 < klawd_prime> can i set an exception handler for nodeunit?
17:16 < EricBlade> ok, well, i figured out where my problem was, my buffer was getting automatically converted to a string somewhere.  
17:17 < EricBlade> so of course, the 128+ bytes ended up disappeared.
17:21 < EricBlade> now i'm getting negative numbers in my binary stream o.O
17:21 < Inquizarus> Anyone that would be able to help me with a problem? Or atleast maybe give a fresh thought about it. :) It's fs.writeFile related.
17:23 < Inquizarus> My server get a socket.io request to overwrite a file and then respond if it was saved succesfully. It responds but the file is still not saved and i get no error.
17:30 < zhodge> Inquizarus: should paste some code

17:58 < TehShrike|Work> jhsto: what's the context here?
17:59 < jhsto> I'm trying to add this string generated on server-side to my post data
18:00 < TehShrike|Work> Are you using some library to send the POST request to the server?
18:00 < TehShrike|Work> Or are you using XMLHttpRequest directly?
18:01 < jhsto> im using express framework
18:01 < jhsto> i really dont know whats behind it
18:01 < TehShrike|Work> aaah, there's the context
18:01 < jhsto> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4295782/node-js-extracting-post-data
18:01 < jhsto> like that
18:02 < Inquizarus> Got myself an error now when debugging some writeFile code.. but i cant find any help on it.

18:02 < TehShrike|Work> jhsto: So I assume you're talking about adding about the client-side, since adding new post values on the server makes no sense?
18:02 < jhsto> yes
18:03 < jhsto> if i could sneak it to dom it would be cool
18:03 < jhsto> but seems like i can't call functions like that
18:03 < TehShrike|Work> jhsto: Sure, you could just add hidden input elements.  I'm not familiar with Express, so I can't say if there's a better way - you might want to check in #express
18:04 < jhsto> Cool, any idea is it possible to add function calls to hidden input elements?
18:04 < TehShrike|Work> On what event would the function be called?
18:04 < jhsto> on document load
18:05 < TehShrike|Work> I don't understand the question.  What would the functions have to do with the hidden input elements?
18:05 < TehShrike|Work> Maybe you're just looking for something like this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2408043/jquery-create-hidden-form-element-on-the-fly
18:06 < jhsto> I think this is what I'm looking for
18:07 < jhsto> I'll make sure to ask from #express if i get some more questions
18:07 < TehShrike|Work> Good luck! :-)
18:07 < Inquizarus> Is there any error documentation for node? Error 3 isnt really that informing. ^^
18:08 < TehShrike|Work> I'm not sure - the error messages I get are generally pretty reasonable (provided I don't have an infinite loop somewhere)
18:08 < Inquizarus> [Error: EACCES, open 'html/dokument/hem.html'] errno: 3, code: 'EACCES', path: 'html/dokument/hem.html'
18:08 < Inquizarus> I guess that its about being allowed to edit the files.. but it worked before... XD
18:09 < jhsto> TehShrike|Work, I forgot to say thank you :)
18:10 < ericelliott> Hi guys. I want to get applitude using npm to manage dependencies, so you can npm install applitude, and it will grab its dependencies and put them somewhere usable on the client side.
18:10 < ericelliott> Are there any client-side libs making good use of npm that I can look at for examples?
18:11 < jQuy> Hi
18:12 < taky> hihi
18:12 < jQuy> I would like to install node js on mac. Do I need xcode for it?
18:13 < taky> lol
18:13 < Inquizarus> http://howtonode.org/how-to-install-nodejs
18:14 < ericelliott> jQuy: Just run the mac osx installer on the node homepage.
18:14 < ericelliott> http://nodejs.org/download/
18:15 < jQuy> ericelliott: so I don't need xcode?
18:16 < ericelliott> jQuy: Not unless you're building from source. I'm pretty sure the mac packaged installer works just fine without it.
18:16 < jQuy> ok
18:19 < jQuy> ericelliott: that was easy :)
18:19 < ericelliott> yeah, I know. I just did it to upgrade my stale version. =)
18:20 < ericelliott> my own package refused to install because I had a later version of node specified (a version I had on another computer).
18:21 < jQuy> so I can update node js via that osx installer when new version is relesed 
18:21 < ericelliott> That sucked, so I changed my package.json to 0.x.x. Something might break if the node API changes in 0.9+, but whatever. I'll fix it when the time comes. ;)
18:21 < ericelliott> yeah. It works fine.
18:22 < jQuy> Next I'm going to install mongodb
18:22 < ericelliott> http://www.mongodb.org/downloads
18:23 < context> brew install mongodb
18:24 < ericelliott> I think homebrew's version requires xcode
18:25 < jQuy> I have to find out if 10.6.8 os x is 64 bit or 32 bit
18:25 < ericelliott> but.. you can just install the XCode command line tools.
18:25 < ericelliott> 64 bit.
18:25 < context> mongo in homebrew is pre-built
18:26 < ericelliott> everything after mac os x 5 is 64 bit
18:26 < context> if you are running homebrew without xcode installed you've got issues to begin with
18:26 < jQuy> ericelliott: ok, nice to know
18:26 < context> ericelliott: depends in your hardware
18:27 < context> jquy: uname -m
18:27 < ericelliott> context: ever mac that came with os x 5+ is 64 bit. All intel 64 bit processors support 64 bit versions of os x
18:27 < context> but yeah its extremely good chance its 64bit
18:27 < jQuy> context: i386
18:27 < context> haha !
18:27 < context> ericelliott: looks like i win
18:27 < context> jquy: 32bit
18:27 < jQuy> context: what?
18:27 < jQuy> context: no way!!!
18:28 < context> jquy: 64bit should still run i think
18:28 < jQuy> I can't believe this
18:28 < context> ericelliott: the first core mbp's ran 32bit kernel by default. even though the cpu supports 64bit
18:28 < context> you can make it run the 64bit kernel though

18:29 < context> ... core2
18:29 < context> a long as time ago....
18:29 < ericelliott> core 2 is 64 bit
18:30 < context> ericelliott: yes, did you read what i wrote
18:30 < ericelliott> context: yes, but core 2 duos shipped with a 64 bit os x
18:30 < context> ericelliott: os x would boot 32 bit by DEFAULT anyway EVEN THOUGH the cpu supported 64bit
18:30 < jQuy> I have to read those instructions and try to change this machine to 64 bit state
18:30 < Inquizarus> I dont get it.. i'm allowed to delete and read files with fs.unlink and fs.fileRead but i may not edit them with fs.writeFile... >_< it's the only operation that return an error..
18:30 < context> ericelliott: i went through all of this on my old mbp
18:31 < ericelliott> context: that's not true of core 2 duo +
18:31 < context> ericelliott: either way, jquy just showed you that his 10.6 is running 32bit.
18:31 < context> jquy: what processor ?
18:31 < jQuy> I know now that my mac can handle 64 bit

18:32 < jQuy> context: Intel Core 2 Duo
18:32 < context> ericelliott: then you can explain to jquy why he is running a 32bit kernel. i imagine he purposely made it that way
18:32 < context> my point again.
18:33 < ericelliott> context: I'm pretty sure it's a selectable option for self-installed OS
18:33 < ericelliott> );
18:33 < ericelliott> somebody told it to install 32 bit.
18:33 < context> ericelliott: no, you can bookt both.
18:33 < jQuy> "These Macs support the 64-bit kernel, but do not use it by default."
18:33 < context> and os x doesnt give you that option
18:33 < ericelliott> I stand corrected.
18:33 < context> ericelliott: you realize just about every executable on your machine has 32bit AND 64bit on it
18:33 < jQuy> "iMac (Early 2008) and later"
18:33 < therealkoopa> Approximately how much slower is it to have a response be generated by a templating engine (e.g. jade) compared to just sending text in the response directly?  Pretty significant?
18:34 < ericelliott> therealkoopa: pretty significant. Cache if you can.
18:34 < therealkoopa> ericelliott: That's what I'm seeing with a silly ab test.  I'm talking HUGE differences.  
18:35 < jQuy> When I bought this mac it was pre-installed
18:35 < context> jquy: thnx, thats the page i was looking for
18:35 < jQuy> context: :)
18:35 < context> jquy: os x doesnt let you 'decide' architecture. it just works. its not linux where you have to figure out what your hardware supports
18:35 < context> err... select on install.
18:35 < ericelliott> therealkoopa: The problem with templates is that all of those vars that get injected are dynamic, and could be computed by running any number of functions, loops, db lookups, etc... so you could end up hitting io wires to fill in template values, and that introduces a lot of overhead.
18:35 < jQuy> Now I'm going to read those instructions...
18:36 < therealkoopa> ericelliott: Yea, I'm going to see if I can get around these templates.
18:36 < ericelliott> context: you win. I thought I remembered selecting 64 bit when I installed the OS for my macbook in 2007. Memory is faulty, though. =)
18:37 < ericelliott> therealkoopa: There's nothing wrong with using templates... just cache the output. =)
18:37 < ericelliott> when it's possible.
18:37 < jQuy> Hi guys, I have to restart this machine
18:37 < jQuy> :D
18:37 < therealkoopa> ericelliott: Are you talking just basic http browser caching, or doing something fancier on the server?
18:37 < ericelliott> it's a lot harder to cache values that depend on things like session cookies. =)

18:38 < ericelliott> therealkoopa: I'm talking about employing a caching layer that is a separate concern from your application.
18:40 < ericelliott> therealkoopa: Check out https://github.com/unprolix/bastard
18:41 < jQuy> Back
18:42 < jQuy> uname -m tells me that I have x86_64 :)
18:43 < therealkoopa> ericelliott: Sweet, I'll check that out.  I only have four jade files (layout, index, login, register).  Once they are in, it's a single page app, just sending json objects.  I was just playing around w/ testing and noticed that jade was slow as balls compared to sending in the response directly.
18:44 < qballer> I got to say that I've been writing some code in node for a few days now and it's fun. I haven't gone in to serious debugging yet. 
18:44 < qballer> But i'm really liking it. 
18:44 < qballer> As I'm starting to write tests - what do you use to debug.
18:44 < jQuy> context: MongoDB is the next thing. Do you think that if I use brew I must have xcode installed?
18:44 < astropirate_> qballer, console.log()
18:45 < qballer> lol
18:45 < qballer> yea, it's usefull what about ndb and inspector 
18:47 < therealkoopa> 100 concurrent connections with a total of 8000 requests takes 1.289 seconds if sending the response directly, and it takes 367.339 seconds
18:48 < therealkoopa> if rendering it through jade
18:49 < myndzi> how do i install only production dependencies with npm?
18:49 < myndzi> --production doesn't appear to be doing it
18:55 < etcetera> ot: anyone know of some good tab management extensions for chrome?
18:58 < jQuy> Oh no! XCode is free for os x 10.7.4 or later...
19:00 < jhsto> do you guys use macs as workstations?
19:00 <@maxogden> i do
19:01 < springmeyer> maxogden: hey there
19:01 <@maxogden> springmeyer: yoyo!
19:01 < springmeyer> yoyo man
19:01 < springmeyer> hey just wrapping up json csv impl first pass
19:01 <@maxogden> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZn_VBgkPNY
19:01 < springmeyer> wondering about quoting
19:01 < springmeyer> are you likely to write strings like:
19:01 < springmeyer> '{"type":"Point","coordinates":[30.0,10.0]}'
19:01 < springmeyer> ?
19:02 < ericelliott> jQuy: Did you try the xcode command line tools?
19:02  * springmeyer loves yoyoma
19:02 <@maxogden> springmeyer: https://github.com/maxogden/dataroller/blob/master/node_modules/shpjson2csv/index.js#L46
19:02 < ericelliott> jhsto: I use a mac.
19:02 < jQuy> ericelliott: I don't have it
19:02 < jhsto> I guess i have to buy one too :P
19:02 < jQuy> I got warning while installing MongoDB
19:02 < ericelliott> jhsto: I really like mine, but you don't need one to use Node.
19:02 < jQuy> "Warning: You really should consult the `brew doctor`!"
19:02 < jhsto> if ill ever make some profit from my student coding, ill sure buy one
19:03 < jQuy> "Warning: We couldn't detect any version of Xcode."
19:03 < springmeyer> maxogden: oh, interesting. mind pasting the output of that for me?
19:03 < jhsto> well you are right, im myself using a year 2004 IDE drive to run linux
19:03 <@maxogden> springmeyer: if you drop a shapefile on filebakery.com its whats in the csv
19:03 < springmeyer> maxogden: ah! cool, back in a moment then :)
19:04 < ericelliott> jhsto: if you get good at node, you should have no trouble profiting from your coding abilities.
19:04 < ericelliott> good JavaScript programmers are hard to find, and get paid well. =)
19:05 < bthesorceror_> hello
19:05 < jhsto> well, im just 16 so i guess there is a lot to learn
19:06 <@maxogden> do you live in russia?
19:06 < jhsto> close enough, finland
19:06 <@maxogden> nice i just bought a plane ticket to helsinki yesterday
19:06 <@maxogden> half of estonia thinks its in the soviet union still anyway
19:06 < jhsto> lol, there is not a lot to see in here
19:06 < littlebear> jhsto: I'm sure there's alot to see
19:06 < littlebear> jhsto: it's just that you've been there for too long
19:06 < jhsto> besides of snow?
19:07 < jhsto> well, you could think it that way
19:07 <@maxogden> if you lived in russia you would get +100 obscure teenage programmer skill pointsj
19:07 <@maxogden> finland only gets you like 25
19:07 < jhsto> what you mean by these points?
19:09 < AvianFlu> jhsto: it's just a joke :)
19:10 < jhsto> so maxogden is russian?
19:10 < chrisjaure> do i get any points by living in wisconsin?
19:12 <@maxogden> i am not russian but russia outputs many prolific teenage programmers
19:13 < jhsto> ah, finnish actually dont have anything besides electronics and software these days
19:13 < springmeyer> maxogden: I think you shared a link for me last time we discussed on the ""
19:13 < jhsto> i mean finland
19:13 < springmeyer> I'm more familiar with using \" 
19:13 < springmeyer> but I should be able to support both, just curious on the "" method
19:14 <@maxogden> springmeyer: oh yeah double quote is in the 'csv rfc'
19:14 < springmeyer> ah, thanks!
19:18 < myndzi> how would i go about implementing client-side templates for a web app? the goal being to 'live' on a single page but be able to change the views
19:18 < myndzi> just set a container's innerHTML to the output of the template's render function?
19:19 < myndzi> is there a better way? maybe render everything and just hide it? i don't even know ;\
19:21 < adlwalrus> Why can't i uninstall modules?
19:21 < qballer> npm remove?
19:22 < Taar779_w> is there a way to make a fucntion synchronous rather than asynchronous?
19:22 < qballer> adlwalrus,  npm uninstall,
19:24 < adlwalrus> npm WARN uninstall not installed in C;\Docs+sets\u\node_modules: "ender"
19:25 < qballer>  -g
19:25 < purr> qballer: No search results found.
19:25 < qballer> add the "-g"
19:26 < adlwalrus> qballer: ah, thanks!
19:26 < adlwalrus> seems to be working.
19:26 < adlwalrus> anyone have exp. with ender?
19:27 < qballer> you installed thos modules locally when you used  -g on npm install 
19:44 < adlwalrus> qballer: ah, i see.
19:44 < adlwalrus> thanks.
19:44 < adlwalrus> qballer: you know anything about ender?
19:49 <@maxogden> isaacs: http://hinrg.cs.jhu.edu/uploads/Main/dvd.pdf
20:08 < tomshreds> hey guys from the package itself is there a quick way of getting the package's version?
20:15 < therealkoopa> Do you recommend bumping up agent.maxSockets?
20:36 < llappy> how can I set Content-Length when piping a readStream to request.put?
20:47 < stisti> llappy: so you know the length in advance?
20:47 < llappy> stisti, yeah, via fs.stat
20:48 < llappy> I think I may have figured it out via some code-reading
20:48 < stisti> I'm really not an expert on this, but I think you need to set the headers before piping
20:49 < _smf_> tomshreds: yeah - see package.json in the top directory of the package.
21:03 < qballer> if someone can help me with this it would be great : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12013106/node-js-how-to-access-an-already-required-object
21:06 < mAritz> qballer: what exactly are you trying to do?
21:10 < qballer> I'm writing an expendable application, I might have issues with module names already loaded.   
21:10 < qballer> I wanted to see if I can remove the module before or check if I loaded it before.
21:11 < qballer> Thing is the user might require as well. I have no idea how to make sure his modules were removed. 
21:11 < qballer> What do you think mAritz 
21:11 < mAritz> i'm not an authorative figure on this by any means, but that sounds like a bad idea.
21:11 < mAritz> in what way are your modules changing on runtime?
21:12 < ccowan> For my "site-specific" or "private" modules I was thining about creating a main module like CompanyName and then hav submodules similart to express or connect. IE CompanyName.Utils
21:12 < qballer> the are incorporated to a flatiron/broadway plug-in.  the plugin is attached and detached. 
21:12 < ccowan> Thoughts?
21:13 < qballer> sometimes switched with another plug-in. New code gets introduced in runtime that I'
21:13 < qballer> I'm not aware of .
21:14 < qballer> Should I bring in name-spacing var specialAppName = specialAppName || {}; and have my app under that name? what should I do.
21:15 < qballer> ccowan, we are on similar topics. I think the commonJS module system is suppose to come in handy here, I'm just not sure how.
21:15 < qballer> maybe it's the path where your packages sit in the file system. this is a bit confusing. 
21:16 < ccowan> yeah
21:16 < ccowan> Right now I have everything in lib/....
21:16 < ccowan> but I really hate it
21:16 < qballer> why?
21:16 < ccowan> ON the frontend we use CompanyName.Views or CompanyName.utils
21:17 < qballer> I mean, why do you hate it. 
21:17 < ccowan> oh... Because to do the include you have to do var utils = require(__dirname+'/../../lib/utils');
21:18 < ccowan> where if I just put it in node_modules/company_name then I just do var CompanyName = require('company_name');
21:18 < qballer> Well the html holds script references. You can still create an object called myCompanyName and give at a utile object. 
21:18 < ccowan> and not have to eff around with the path
21:19 < qballer> Are you going to reserve a special place for it ?
21:19 < ccowan> besides node_modules/company_name?
21:20 < qballer> for instance you project tree will be proj/lib, proj/companyName  - always ? if yes you can do a simple index.js and require it when you want cross company server side utill. 
21:20 < qballer>  proj/companyName/index.js 
21:20 < ccowan> under company_name I would just put all the sub modules in either node_modules
21:20 < ccowan> right
21:21 < ccowan> index.js would be responsible for including the sub modules
21:21 < qballer> yep. and the node_modules folder in pro/companyName will hold only dependencies for those modules. 
21:21 < ccowan> yup
21:22 < qballer> the index.js  in company will expose everything in the structure you agree upon.
21:22 < ccowan> We have a few modules that are shared with the FE
21:23 < ccowan> qballer: yup
21:25 < qballer> now ccowan can you solve this ? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12013106/node-js-how-to-access-an-already-required-object
21:25 < qballer> :)
21:30 < DTrejo> qballer: I recommend playing with require.cache
21:31 < DTrejo> qballer: for example, do node -pe "h = require('http'); console.log(util.inspect(require.cache);"
21:31 < ccowan> reuqire.cache is an object and not a function
21:32 < qballer> Ok nice.
21:32 < rektide_> what's the module that allows you to access a file's contents via require()? i think it might be a substack module
21:32 < qballer> I corrected the code there. 
21:32 < ccowan> does it run now
21:32 < DTrejo> qballer: here this actually works: node -pe 'h = require("http"); setTimeout( function () { console.log(require("util").inspect(require.cache)) }, 1);'
21:33 < DTrejo> if you use a module other than http might give you more info
21:33 < stisti> isn't it more usual to do: module.exports.somename = function... ?
21:33 < DTrejo> stisti: depends on how you want your api to be
21:34 < mikeal> how do i install socket.io without any of the complied deps?
21:34 < stisti> DTrejo: ah! I'm still coming to grips with the flexibility of javascript
21:36 < qballer> DTrejo, it didn't give me any special information.
21:36 < qballer> could you share some more details on stack?
21:36 < qballer> or up vote or explain right here :)
21:38 < qballer> thanks guys.
21:39 < justicefries> so I'm using knox, and everything is going swell. doing a put.
21:39 < justicefries> however, when I wrap it in a crypto.randomBytes so that I can get a buffer out of it, it's suddenly slow and my puts just...don't work.
21:39 < justicefries> anyone have any idea hwere I can start to poke around?
21:42 < justicefries> weird if I do it sync it works
21:42 < justicefries> it only fails when doing it async
21:45 < ccowan> mikeal: I haven't used Socket.io what the issue with the compiled dependicies?
21:46 < mikeal> i don't take compiled deps in to my tree, ever
21:47 < ccowan> yeah... I agree it's a pain in the ass when there are compiled depends
21:47 < ccowan> is this for one of you node modules or a project that depends on it?
21:48 < ccowan> For my stuff I just commit it and then run npm rebuild.
21:48 < ccowan> on push
21:49 < ccowan> but it totally irritates me
21:57 < jocafa> how did i not know about gcc -MM?
22:07 < mikeal> ccowan: it's for gather.at
22:07 < mikeal> we don't take compiled deps so that we don't have to do rebuilds
22:07 < mikeal> and so that newly provisioned machines don't have system deps and libraries other than node
22:07 < ccowan> nice
22:08 < ccowan> so what do you do when you need functionality that only has a node_module with a build depend? Write your own?
22:09 < qballer> maybe I'm not getting something, but whats wrong with reusing ? 
22:09 < ccowan> nothing if it doesn't have a build depend
22:10 < ccowan> mikeal just wants to keep his env pure JS instead of having modules that require binaries compiled
22:11 < mikeal> i still haven't found a case where i require a compiled dep
22:11 < mikeal> a few things as slightly slower
22:11 < mikeal> like ws and redis
22:11 < mikeal> but not noticably
22:11 < mikeal> there actually isn't that much stuff that requires compilation in the node module space
22:12 < ccowan> mikeal: Do you guys have to deal with XML at all?
22:13 < mikeal> nope, but i do in other apps, and i use saxjs
22:13 <@isaacs> w00t w00t, saxjs!
22:13 <@isaacs> saxy
22:15 < ccowan> mikeal: are you using bcrypt?
22:15 < mikeal> nope
22:15 < ccowan> what are you doing for password hashes?
22:16 < mikeal> i'm not
22:16 < mikeal> :)
22:16 < ccowan> ha ha
22:16 < mikeal> i don't store passwords
22:16 < mikeal> :)
22:16 < ccowan> Do you have logins?
22:16 < mikeal> people login with facebook/twitter
22:16 < ccowan> ah
22:16 < ccowan> must be nice
22:17 < ccowan> except when FB or Twitter is down :P
22:17 < ccowan> I want to get out of the login business
22:17 < RLa> when has one of them been down or both of them at the same time?
22:17 < mikeal> yeah, once you login with both you can get at your account with either
22:17 < ccowan> RLa: it's probably a rare edge case
22:18 < RLa> and doesn't it use oauth?
22:18 < RLa> so you could add more providers as well
22:18 < ccowan> but if you only use Facebook and not Twitter then you're locked out
22:18 < ccowan> RLa: I wish it was that simple :D
22:18 < mikeal> twitter and facebook auth couldn't be more different
22:19 < ccowan> mikeal: don't you just love that?
22:20 < mikeal> yeah, it's awesome to have a code path for every auth provider
22:20 < mikeal> oauth "support" doesn't make any of it easier
22:20 < mikeal> i end up adding code for every new host i ever auth with
22:20 < ccowan> I think it makes it worse
22:21 < mikeal> header signing makes everything aweful
22:21 < mikeal> anyone that doesn't I love
22:21 < mikeal> facebook is good like that
22:21 < ccowan> becaues you go into it with the belief that it will be eaiser then you're totally let down
22:21 < mikeal> header signing is just too brittle, and you never know who or when someone will mess with the headers and invalidate the signature
22:22 < ccowan> We have to support Garmin uploads and every couple of years they come put with a completely different format for the GPS devices... So I have to write transformers for each type to normalized them down to the same format. Total nightmare
22:23 < springmeyer> isaacs: >= node v0.6 is reported for the min node version for npm at https://npmjs.org/doc/README.html
22:23 < springmeyer> but running `curl https://npmjs.org/install.sh |  sh` with node v0.6.18 installed locally
22:23 < springmeyer> gives:
22:23 < springmeyer> You need node >=0.8 to run this program.
22:23 < springmeyer> node --version reports: v0.6.18
22:24 < springmeyer> is that intended?
22:24 < ccowan> All the business guys think... "Well it's just a garmin GPS how different could it be"... They think te same thing about oauth
22:24 < springmeyer> in other words, are the docs out of date at https://npmjs.org/doc/README.html ?
22:25 < ccowan> I digress... 
22:26 <@maxogden> springmeyer: im sitting next to isaac in case you want me to smack him
22:26 <@maxogden> actually kicking would be easier
22:27 < springmeyer> maxogden: lol, no hurry, just trying to get a TileMill build for jessica and its broken because we have to stick to node v0.6 right now and npm appears to require node v0.8
22:27 <@maxogden> ahahah
22:27 < mikeal> hehe
22:27 < mikeal> maxogden: where are you guys?
22:27 < springmeyer> we are stuck at node v0.6 due to the process.title bug
22:27 <@maxogden> mikeal: arbor
22:27 < ccowan> maxogden: smack him around a bit!!! Take pictures of him curled up in the fetal position after you've severly beaten him :D
22:27 < qballer> I got an answer to my question. 
22:27 < mikeal> will you be there for a whiel?
22:27 <@maxogden> springmeyer: ahh bummer
22:27 < springmeyer> (https://github.com/mapbox/tilemill/issues/1586)
22:27 <@maxogden> mikeal: weve been here for like an hour
22:28 < mikeal> i wanna head over there but i have to fix the crank on my bike first
22:28 < mikeal> it started to come out and the part just got here today
22:28 < mikeal> ok, i'll head over in like 20 minutes
22:29 < qballer> ccowan, require("./path/to/name") gets mapped to path.resolve("./path/to/name") which could be "/home/user/project/path/to/name" or something.
22:29 < ccowan> qballer: right... that make sense

22:30 < WinVery> ah node http://winvery.com
22:30 <@maxogden> springmeyer: isaac said he is working on a build right now that works on 0.6 again
22:31 < springmeyer> ooooooo
22:31 < springmeyer> nice :)
22:31 < nuba_> ca thode
22:32 <@isaacs> springmeyer: will be fixed in minutes :)
22:32 <@isaacs> springmeyer: just finishing up a few other bugfixes for npm
22:33 <@isaacs> 1.1.50 will have you covered.
22:33 < springmeyer> brilliant isaacs - thank you

22:34 < springmeyer> high five #jlordtechsupport
22:37 < tprice> is websocket supported on nodejitsu?
22:38 < qballer> you can combine socket.io with union.
22:38 < qballer> It should be a nice thing and a fall back in case.

22:47 < TooTallNate> nfriedly: it's possible, see https://gist.github.com/3119325
22:47 < TooTallNate> those instructions worked for me
22:48 < nfriedly> Thanks, I'll give it a shot
22:48 < codingstream> if im not doing anything fancy with a few relational tables that all run on one box, is there any big benefit from going with postgres over mysql?

23:06 < Domenic> If I listen to a stream's "data" event solely for the purposes of emitting progress, does that interfere with piping in any way? E.g. does it start putting things in memory where before it directly connected the pipes?
23:06 < Domenic> Relevant code: https://github.com/LearnBoost/knox/blob/87e3ce48fe68a16c2471f6de448b77f1dcbeb2b2/lib/client.js#L200-207
