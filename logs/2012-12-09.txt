00:02 < gildean> garbagecollectio: there's an installer for mac, and it's also installabe on from the brew
00:02 < gildean> garbagecollectio: did you even bother to check before asking+
00:03 < gildean> ?
00:03 < Zelest> SomeoneWeird, can you "inject" middlewear by middlewear?
00:03 < Zelest> e.g, inject the destructor from/by the constructor?
00:04 < garbagecollectio> gildean: YES
00:07 < gildean> garbagecollectio: then why did you ask if you already knew the answer?
00:08 < garbagecollectio> who says i knew the answer?
00:08 < gildean> so you didn't check?
00:29 < garbagecollectio> how cna i make node.js throw an error on a condition
00:29 < garbagecollectio> with an error message
00:32 < TehShrike1> With throw?
00:33 < joaojeronimo> I'm getting this super weird error: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1420062/ what does it mean ?
00:34 < garbagecollectio> throw "Not a valid entry"
00:34 < garbagecollectio> ??
00:46 < TehShrike1> garbagecollectio: I don't understand what you're asking

01:42 < garbagecollectio> console.log(' list: %j', program.list);
01:42 < garbagecollectio> what si the %j?
01:43 < Sly> garbagecollectio: JSON
01:44 < Sly> I believe
01:44 < garbagecollectio> weird
01:44 < garbagecollectio> return val.split('..').map(Number);
01:44 < garbagecollectio> would return json?
01:45 < SomeoneWeird> wat
01:45 < SomeoneWeird> json/array
01:46 < garbagecollectio> array is  not json
01:48 < Manny> soo.. whos hirigin? :)
01:48 < Guest36117> hiring*
01:48 < garbagecollectio> i am
01:48 < garbagecollectio> what is ur background
01:49 < Guest36117> may I PM you?
02:37 < Bilge> Is there a library for distributed node solutions?
02:38 < Bilge> i.e. an easy way to write an application that scale across multiple servers
02:38 < gabrieluk> yup, riak ^^
02:39 < gabrieluk> vectorclocks'n'all
02:39 < jrajav> Wouldn't it be better to leave that scaling to a proper load balancer?
02:39 < jrajav> Or is that what you're asking
02:39 < Mansoor> I was going to suggest the same
02:40 < Mansoor> Use something like Redis to hold your appliction state
02:40 < Mansoor> and put a load balancer infront of your nodes
02:45 < d4rklit3> hey
02:45 < d4rklit3> anyone ever use Nib for stylus?
02:46 < d4rklit3> I can find a reference for the mixins.. like i don't know what they are called.
02:49 < trypwire> what's a good way to test socket-based apps locally?
02:49 < misterhat> localhost
02:49 < misterhat> :P
02:49 < trypwire> right
02:49 < trypwire> i'm using 2 browsers
02:49 < trypwire> i guess the problem is that they're trying to use my mic..
02:51 < jrajav> d4rklit3: http://visionmedia.github.com/nib/
02:51 < jrajav> d4rklit3: https://github.com/visionmedia/nib
02:52 < jrajav> d4rklit3: http://nib.visionmedia.com/github
02:52 < jrajav> (That last one was a joke)
02:56 < gabrieluk> Ha ha Ha That was funny
03:19 < garbagecollectio> this vision media shit
03:19 < garbagecollectio> is too complicated
03:20 < drudge> lol
03:21 < garbagecollectio> anything that isnt like really simple for developers is almost not worth using
03:21 < SomeoneWeird> what lib?
03:21 < garbagecollectio> expect to learn new paradigms to do something easy
03:21 < SomeoneWeird> if it's easy then don't use them
03:21 < SomeoneWeird> simple
03:21 < devaholic> xpect to learn new paradigms all the time using node
03:25 < garbagecollectio> how do i get a name from an object
03:25 < garbagecollectio> or rather
03:27 < garbagecollectio> shit
03:27 < garbagecollectio> this.mode = this.dev;
03:27 < garbagecollectio> and this.dev is an object
03:28 < garbagecollectio> but i need to just get the this.dev
03:28 < garbagecollectio> or whatever this.mode equals
03:28 < garbagecollectio> not that actual objects
03:35 < SomeoneWeird> huh
03:35 < SomeoneWeird> this.mode = this[dev]
03:50 < garbagecollectio> i dont get
03:50 < garbagecollectio> how
03:50 < garbagecollectio> why
03:50 < garbagecollectio> all these node.js modules use prototypes
03:50 < garbagecollectio> there is almost no encapsulation
03:51 < Industrial> What happens when you create more workers then you have CPU's e.g. one worker for each service?
03:52 < Industrial> I'm trying to figure out if it's possible and how to create a network of 'nodes' e.g. maybe one for each website and then pipe streams to the correct nodes for each request
03:53 < Industrial> but I'm not sure about things like what happens to functions and/org cyclical data structures (e.g. a http request/response object) if a node lives on another host?
03:57 < carlos5> In UDP what us the checksum field used for?
03:57 < carlos5> Is it to check if all the chunks came through?
04:02 < carlos5> I was right! Verify end-to-end
04:10 < garbagecollectio> can u guys review my node module
04:10 < garbagecollectio> thus far
04:10 < garbagecollectio> and tell me what sucks and what could be done better
04:10 < garbagecollectio> https://gist.github.com/4ad0b2f664573def4da4
04:24 < stagas> garbagecollectio: fix the white space it's unreadable
04:24 < garbagecollectio> ok
04:51 < sayd> hi is anyone familar with https://npmjs.org/package/yeoman-coffeebone im stuck at the node server.js step ( don't see any port serving and not sure how to find it)
05:46 < guest10202939222> i made some local modifications to https://github.com/nathansobo/event-tap/ but i don't know how to rebuild it
05:47 < guest10202939222> i did npm install -g node-gyp but i don't have the node-gyp binary to configure or build
05:47 < guest10202939222> i have python, make and cc installed
05:48 < guest10202939222> any suggestions?
05:48 < bnoordhuis> guest10202939222: node-gyp rebuild
05:49 < guest10202939222> bnoordhuis: there is no node-gyp binary
05:49 < bnoordhuis> guest10202939222: you have but it's not on your PATH
05:49 < guest10202939222> when i do node-gyp commands i get:
05:49 < guest10202939222> node-gyp rebuild bash: node-gyp: command not found
05:49 < guest10202939222> ah
05:49 < guest10202939222> echo $PATH bin:/opt/github/rbenv/shims:/opt/github/homebrew/share/python:node_modules/.bin:/opt/github/bin:/opt/github/homebrew/bin:/opt/github/homebrew/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/X11/bin
05:50 < guest10202939222> where is the path to node-gyp?
05:50 < bnoordhuis> guest10202939222: `updatedb && locate node-gyp`
05:51 < bnoordhuis> guest10202939222: or `mdfind node-gyp` if you're on a mac
05:51 < bnoordhuis> which it seems you are
05:52 < guest10202939222> bnoordhuis: haha how can you tell i'm on a mac? my IP or something?
05:52 < bnoordhuis> guest10202939222: no, because you've got homebrew things on your path
05:52 < guest10202939222> hehehe
05:53 < guest10202939222> :]
05:53 < guest10202939222> also thanks for the mdfind tip
05:53 < bnoordhuis> np :)
05:53 < guest10202939222> whats the difference between that and find?
05:53 < bnoordhuis> mdfind is like an auto-updating locate
05:53 < bnoordhuis> that's the one thing i envy os x for
05:54 < guest10202939222> haha
05:54 < guest10202939222> kickass
05:54 < guest10202939222> also 
05:54 < guest10202939222> one last question
05:54 < bnoordhuis> sure
05:54 < sayd> is it chill to add ./node_modules/.bin to $PATH
05:55 < sayd> or should i be using npm link or what
05:55 < guest10202939222> i'm modifying that event-tap module for use in: https://github.com/nathansobo/hoverboard.... if i want to use my local version of event-tap, can i point the package.json file to a local directory instead of a git repo? also can it be a relative path or must it be absoltue?
05:56 < bnoordhuis> sayd: i guess isaacs is more qualified to comment on that but i occasionally add it to the PATH
05:57 < bnoordhuis> guest10202939222: that should work. with either relative or absolute path, i think
05:58 < yields> Is it possible to list private dependencies in package.json ?
06:00 < guest10209039128> sorry lost connection
06:01 < guest10209039128> did you leave a reply bnoordhuis?
06:01 < bnoordhuis> guest10202939222: yes. > that should work. with either relative or absolute path, i think
06:01 < guest10209039128> ^^
06:01 < guest10209039128> also my real irc name is razic
06:01 < guest10209039128> about to change it now
06:02 < guest10209039128> downloading colloquy
06:02 < guest10209039128> haven't used irc in a while but it's unbelievably helpful in situations like this
06:02 < JohnnyL> do you guys think json will become the standard in file formats?
06:03 < guest10209039128> JohnnyL: isn't it already?
06:03 < misterhat> it is
06:03 < danmactough> yields: You bet. npm help json
06:03 < misterhat> .json
06:03 < misterhat> :P
06:04 < misterhat> wouldn't it be funny if it didn't use JSON
06:04 < misterhat> and used XML
06:04 < misterhat> :P
06:04 < JohnnyL> agreed, i think it'll catch on the other languages. it is superior and concise enough.
06:05 < JohnnyL> on=onto
06:05 < JohnnyL> {on: 'onto'}
06:05 < misterhat> it has already?
06:06 < misterhat> it has libraries in almost every modern language
06:06 < JohnnyL> oh ok
06:06 < JohnnyL> regexp rocks too.
06:06 < JohnnyL> a shame linux only has 1.64% of all pc users.
06:10 < timeturner> is it ok to do something like this: socket.on('message', function(message) { socket.broadcast.emit('message', message); });
06:10 < timeturner> emit from the client on 'event' and have the client listen on 'event' ?
06:10 < FunnyLookinHat> timeturner, Yeah totally
06:11 < FunnyLookinHat> I would tend to argue that it's better to define two separate event names for server side and client side - just to keep things straight - but it's fine.
06:11 < timeturner> yeah it might get confusing
06:15 < timeturner> if there was an error from validation what would be the best way to respond to the client socket?
06:16 < FunnyLookinHat> depends on the type of validation I suppose... I usually have an "error" event that sends a packet with the event type and message
06:16 < FunnyLookinHat> so you know what error'd
06:16 < timeturner> and then just display that to the client
06:16 < timeturner> yeah that works
06:18 < JohnnyL> are there xlib routines written in node.js?
06:22 < razic> bnoordhuis: it's guest101209801 :] thanks again… are you a maintainer of node?
06:25 < bnoordhuis> razic: yes, i am
06:31 < razic> bnoordhuis: Awesome. I work at GitHub and love node. Planning on using it to rebuild my favorite electronic device the TouchStream by Fingerworks: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FingerWorks
06:32 < bnoordhuis> razic: neat project :)
06:33 < razic> Will work on any touch device, but planning on using two iPad mini's in a split-keyboard fashion.
06:33 < systemfault> Does node has a clone(deep copy) method?
06:33 < razic> Also I'm pissed at this guy: www.kickstarter.com/projects/1116966310/multi-touch-keyboard-and-mouse
06:34 < systemfault> razic: Looks like a nice keyboard, what's up with it?
06:34 < razic> systemfault: It's over 12 years old and Apple bought the company for the patents and shut it down immediately.
06:34 < SomeoneWeird> systemfault, maybe var newobj = new Object(old);
06:34 < SomeoneWeird> or
06:34 < systemfault> Ah :/
06:35 < razic> systemfault: The guy who built it wrote his PHD thesis on it here: http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~westerma/main.pdf
06:35 < SomeoneWeird> hm i thought there was a module for it
06:35 < razic> systemfault: oh, you mean the kickstarter one? it's going to be a piece of shit
06:36 < systemfault> razic: Well, that's the one you pasted (I might have missed the beginning of the conversation)
06:36 < razic> systemfault: this is the real deal one http://www.dustyneuron.com/fingerworks/lp_product.html
06:37 < razic> Can't buy them anymore, over 100 gestures and programmable. Zero-force touch keyboard.
06:37 < systemfault> Looks like a 1990 design :/
06:37 < razic> Hey! I was born in 1990 :]
06:37 < razic> Hahaha.
06:38 < systemfault> :D
06:38 < SomeoneWeird> wow it looks nicee
06:38 < razic> SomeoneWeird: the keyboard?
06:38 < systemfault> I'd probably buy a model M before that :P
06:38 < razic> hahaha
06:38 < razic> That's what everyone says, but it's the most amazing thing in the world.
06:38 < SomeoneWeird> yeah that keyboard
06:38 < razic> I feel powerless on a normal keyboard.
06:39 < razic> SomeoneWeird: keep an eye out on https://github.com/nathansobo/hoverboard
06:39 < razic> Two GitHubbers are working on a free clone.
06:39 < SomeoneWeird> neat
06:40 < SomeoneWeird> ew
06:40 < SomeoneWeird> osx
06:40 < razic> SomeoneWeird: For now… 
06:41 < razic> If it becomes popular, I'm sure other support will be added in.
06:41 < SomeoneWeird> presuming its node?
06:41 < razic> Yes.
06:41 < razic> With C++ bindings
06:42 < SomeoneWeird> then i'm sure someone will help
06:44 < razic> :]
06:47 < Sly> http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/06/the-onion-apple-to-fix-map-software-by-rearranging-earths-geography/
06:48 < prishabh> so where is ryah ?
06:48 < prishabh> http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4892174
06:52 < SomeoneWeird> ‽‽‽
06:55 < yields> Is it possible to list private local dependencies in package.json ?
06:59 < deoxxa> yields: maybe - elaborate
07:00 < yields> deoxxa i reached github private repos limit, i have private repos in my filesystem, is it possible to list them in `.dependencies` of package.json and just install them ?
07:02 < deoxxa> that sounds like a reaaaaally bad way to work around that "problem"
07:02 < yields> deoxxa, other solutions might be awesome...
07:02 < yields> possibly related to http://git.io/d6KoiQ
07:02 < deoxxa> you could host your own git repositories - it's not exactly hard
07:03 < deoxxa> but no, i don't think you can specify an arbitrary path on your system...
07:03 < yields> yeah i might have to do that, just didn't want to because there really small deps.
07:03 < yields> actually you can do `npm install ../foo/bar`
07:03 < yields> it will work but it's not meh
07:04 < deoxxa> that's a bit different
07:04 < deoxxa> (i think)
07:04 < yields> might be, thanks i'll just host them.
07:05 < deoxxa> wow, he quit fast
07:05 < deoxxa> i was about to mention how easy it is to set up a private registry
07:15 < razic> bnoordhuis: i was able to use the node-gyp binary to build my local event-tap. however, when i run npm install from the hoverboard directory, it barfs… it appears to be looking in the node registry instead of my local drive.
07:17 < razic> cat package.json | ack event-tap
07:17 < razic> "event-tap": "/Users/razic/razic/event-tap"
07:18 < razic> ls ls /Users/razic/razic/event-tap
07:18 < razic> binding.gyp  build        event-tap.js node_modules package.json src
07:35 < razic> do i need to use npm link?
07:37 < SomeoneWeird> no
07:38 < razic> why does it look in the npm registry when i specify a local path?
07:40 < SomeoneWeird> hm?
07:41 < razic> npm install is seemingly looking for a dependecy package in npm registry as opposed to my local drive.
07:41 < razic> cat package.json | ack event-tap
07:42 < razic> "event-tap": "../event-tap",
07:42 < SomeoneWeird> ah yeah
07:42 < SomeoneWeird> it's supposed to
07:42 < SomeoneWeird> because the package may need specific versions 
07:42 < razic> but i want to install my local version so when i make changes i don't have to push to git everytime
07:42 < _numbers> how does mocha.js tell if beforeEach() or it() functions have specified a (done) argument? it seems like it is doing it before calling the function, because specifying it creates a blocking test, and not specifying it creates a non-blocking test.
07:42 <@Nexxy> razic, https://npmjs.org/doc/link.html
07:44 < razic> Nexxy: thanks that worked
07:44 <@Nexxy> :)
07:44 < razic> :]
07:46 < razic> Nexxy: if i make changes to the package i just linked, do i have to recompile the c++ with node-gyp everytime?
07:47 < razic> it appears so
07:49 < razic> ah nevermind. i just had to restart the server
07:52 < _numbers> ah Function.length :) https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/length
08:08 < razic> is socket.io the recommended websocket package for node?
08:09 < tuhoojabotti> razic: depends 
08:09 < razic> tuhoojabotti: could you elaborate :)
08:09 < SomeoneWeird> for plain websockets just use 'ws'
08:09 < tuhoojabotti> if you want fast implementation you might want ws 
08:10 < tuhoojabotti> yeah 
08:10 < gildean> socket.io is built on top of the ws-module
08:10 < razic> Ah, that sounds more down my alley then.
08:10 < razic> Smaller and faster :]
08:10 < gildean> what socket.io has is the fallbacks and things like rooms etc. inbuilt
08:11 < razic> got it :] thanks guys
08:11 < gildean> but the plain websocket implementation in socket.io is the 'ws' module
08:12 < tuhoojabotti> it also has the extra stuff 
08:14 < razic> when i added ws as a dependency to my project, it put a node_modules/.bin/wscat file into my repo. is that something i should commit?
08:15 < razic> looks like a debug tool
08:16 < gildean> razic: nah, wscat is like netcat
08:16 < gildean> but for websockets
08:16 < razic> :]
08:17 < gildean> you can try it out for example wscat -c ws://echo.websocket.org
08:18 < razic> neat
08:26 < SomeoneWeird> razic, you probably shouldn't commit node_modules
08:27 < ashnur> do any of you maybe know of a simple method how to extract the list of image src attributes from a html string?
08:27 < razic> SomeoneWeird: why? it looks like nathansobo did in his initial commit: https://github.com/nathansobo/hoverboard/commit/ed46c16c6c95fc324091d0125b00216b1fe23576
08:27 < SomeoneWeird> look for a regex that does it asherkin 
08:27 < SomeoneWeird> ashnur, *
08:28 < ashnur> i don't trust other people's regular expressions. they aren't too good most of the times :)
08:28 < SomeoneWeird> then write one yourself
08:28 < SomeoneWeird> and don't complain :P
08:29 < ashnur> who was?
08:29 < SomeoneWeird> you, lol
08:29 < SomeoneWeird> asking for an answer but not wanting to use anyone elses
08:31 < razic> SomeoneWeird: http://www.mikealrogers.com/posts/nodemodules-in-git.html
08:32 < razic> confused :(
08:41 < deoxxa> razic: it's largely down to personal preference
08:42 < deoxxa> razic: npm has a function called "shrinkwrap" which achieves most of the same things as committing node_modules
08:42 < nmosis> i will gut all your police officers they will hang from trees and thier blood will be upon your head, 
08:42 < nmosis> wheres dhal face
08:42 < razic> deoxxa: thanks. i'm going to follow what the repository owner is doing.
08:42 < deoxxa> nmosis: he's been missing for a lonnnng time
08:42 < nmosis> good
08:43 < nmosis> he's with me then
08:44 < nmosis> prepare for the Mass of Christ mayors everywhere

09:20 < innociv> I'm trying to get monit to kill node.js when it's using too much cpu.  Can someone help?  I have it set up like this: http://pastebin.com/7TbrJBvU when I run "monit status" it will monit it once, then stop it once when triggered to properly. The program will automatically restart(because of forever), but it no longer monitors it unless I change the process name in the config and restart monit.
09:48 < razic> how can i require 'ws' on the client side?
09:48 < gildean> razic: you don't, if the client is a browser
09:49 < razic> Okay… then how can I follow these docs? http://einaros.github.com/ws/
09:49 < razic> just put it in my express application file
09:49 < razic> L
09:49 < razic> ?
09:49 < gildean> razic: you just open a websocket with the browser like var websockeConnection = new WebSocket('ws://serverurl.tld');
09:49 < razic> ah
09:50 < razic> where can i find docs on that?
09:50 < gildean> razic: the docs presume the client is not a browser but a node.js app itself
09:50 < razic> got it
09:51 < gildean> http://www.websocket.org/
09:51 < razic> what about this one? http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-websockets-20110419/
09:51 < gildean> should have the info on using websockets on a browser
09:53 < gildean> basically if your browser supports websockets, you can just open up a websocket connection like i showed above
09:53 < gildean> then the connection object will have only four different possible events, and just a couple of different properties
09:54 < razic> alright *tinkers*
09:55 < nmosis> why doesnt #c let me in
09:56 < gildean> nmosis: i'm guessing they've moved to ##c
09:58 < nmosis> why
09:59 < nmosis> is #c not open source?
09:59 < nmosis> i thought is is open source
10:00 < nmosis> why gildean
10:01 < iksik> gildean: use socket.io or some similar lib
10:04 < gildean> iksik: what?
10:05 < nmosis> why is it no leting me in
10:05 < nmosis> because this one has virus?
10:05 < nmosis> its public
10:05 < nmosis> but C is member only?
10:05 < iksik> gildean: sorry, it was for razic ;-P
10:05 < iksik> eh
10:05 < SomeoneWeird> you need to have a registered freenode account nmosis 
10:05 < SomeoneWeird> and then join ##c
10:05 < gildean> nmosis: the general language-channels were moved from #channel to ##channel
10:06 < RLa> double # is for non-project channels
10:06 < gildean> nmosis: so i presume the active channel is ##c
10:06 < nmosis> SAYS I HAVE TO BE A REGRISTRARED MEMBER
10:07 < gildean> iksik: his question was also how to open a websocket connection on a browser, so i'm guessing he has a server running already
10:07 < nmosis> i just want som C source code to play with after i cancel my internet
10:07 < gildean> nmosis: then register your nick with chanserv
10:07 < RLa> nmosis, /msg nickserv register password email
10:07 < nmosis> using cmatrix to show a datafall for various spectral sensors
10:07 < iksik> gildean: yeah, but socket.io is also a client (with nice fallback support)
10:07 < nmosis> i don have an email handy
10:07 < nmosis> ask someone for C sourcode
10:07 < SomeoneWeird> lmao
10:08 < SomeoneWeird> why dont you google for some?
10:08 < iksik> mailinator :D
10:08 < nmosis> google never shows anything useful at all
10:08 < nmosis> just troll wikis
10:08 < gildean> iksik: yes, but the question was about the ws module, which he picked because he wanted a more barebones websocket implementation
10:08 < RLa> freenode does not spam so you can use your real email address
10:08 < nmosis> and sites that ask for credit cards
10:08 < razic> iksik: i don't care about fallback
10:09 < SomeoneWeird> go download cjdns and play with it nmosis 
10:09 < nmosis> noone wants to help
10:09 < iksik> ok, ok ;-)
10:09 < iksik> didn't noticed that ;>
10:09 < nmosis> everytime i google for somehing it leads me o a hijack
10:09 < razic> iksik: https://github.com/nathansobo/hoverboard
10:09 < SomeoneWeird> then you have a virus.
10:09 < razic> performance is the main concern
10:09 < iksik> or very low google-fu level ;-P
10:10 < nmosis> once i googled for dhcp
10:10 < nmosis> the real one not internet consortium
10:10 < nmosis> and i get led o a hijack
10:10 < SomeoneWeird> wtf are you on about
10:10 < SomeoneWeird> <SomeoneWeird> then you have a virus.
10:10 < nmosis> everytime
10:10 < SomeoneWeird> <SomeoneWeird> then you have a virus.
10:10 < nmosis> then the guy comes in here and trolls me
10:10 < nmosis> they portscan
10:10 < SomeoneWeird> like you're trolling at the moment
10:11 < nmosis> then he gives me a link to some tld bashscripting site
10:11 < iksik> razic: i don't get it, but okay, if raw WS object solves your problem, fine by me ;-P
10:11 < nmosis> and i always needs "updates"
10:11 < SomeoneWeird> <SomeoneWeird> then you have a virus.
10:11 < nmosis> "updates"
10:11 < SomeoneWeird> are you listening to me?
10:11 < nmosis> yes
10:11 < nmosis> i cant code the whole OS from scratch
10:11 < nmosis> they all have virus
10:11 < SomeoneWeird> you have a virus
10:12 < SomeoneWeird> just get rid of it
10:12 < SomeoneWeird> -.-
10:12 < nmosis> its in the OS
10:12 < nmosis> everyhing on freenode
10:12 < SomeoneWeird> wot
10:12 < nmosis> every linux especially ubuntu
10:12 < nmosis> download a broken iso then needs "updates"
10:13 < nmosis> and the updates are the key to he virus
10:13 < SomeoneWeird> i'm not gunna bother
10:13 < gildean> nmosis: you're not making much sense
10:13 < nmosis> i downloaded openbsd
10:13 < iksik> hahaha ;-DDD
10:13 < iksik> nmosis: every single linux distribution needs updates after installation - unless you're downloading it exactly in the moment of release ;P
10:13 < nmosis> as long as i dont plug the network cable in i should be ok
10:14 < nmosis> bu i need some C code to play with
10:14 < nmosis> give me 8gigs of C code
10:14 < RLa> download some distro that comes with source code then
10:14 < nmosis> ill put i on my USB
10:15 < nmosis> *gigs should be a lifetimes worth
10:15 < SomeoneWeird> 8 gigs of sourcecode?
10:15 < SomeoneWeird> thats like
10:15 < SomeoneWeird> yeah.
10:15 < nmosis> then i will qui freenode
10:15 < nmosis> im leaving you!
10:15 < SomeoneWeird> good
10:15 < SomeoneWeird> goodbye
10:15 < RLa> kernel.org will get you 50MB of high-quality C code
10:15 < nmosis> i need 8 gigs of C source first
10:15  * iksik is afraid to ask... 'why?' ;-S
10:16 < SomeoneWeird> go google "filetype:c"
10:16 < SomeoneWeird> iksik, hes trolling
10:16 < nmosis> why what?
10:16 < RLa> he wants to read it line by line
10:16 < nmosis> I want to code
10:16 < gildean> nmosis: just scrape every c-project on github, it might be enough to get you 8GB
10:16 < iksik> SomeoneWeird: got it -_-
10:16 < nmosis> mostly without the internet
10:16 < RLa> or download whole debian source packages archive
10:16 < RLa> that should get you couple of GB
10:17 < nmosis> well as much as i can get to fill up a USB drive
10:17 < nmosis> that way it reduces the likelyhood of ever needing the internet again
10:18 < SomeoneWeird> okay then.
10:19 < nmosis> if i ever need a reference
10:19 < nmosis> i can look through the 8 gigs

10:20 < nmosis> I want RFC's
10:20 < RLa> what if you need to contact some source authors, will you use snail mail?
10:20 < nmosis> I want HAM radio code
10:20 < nmosis> snail mail certainly is better
10:20 < nmosis> if they answer
10:20 < nmosis> CISCO doesnt even answer

10:21 < nmosis> I would enjoy killing the internet
10:21 < nmosis> need an army to backup some UN mandate

10:35 < Zol> On windows 7 64 bit with 32bit node installed, how do you use installed libs from npm in the command prompt, like Bower for example? 
10:36 < SomeoneWeird> npm install bower
10:38 < Zol> I have already installed bower, but I have to manually go to %appdata%/Roaming/npm/ and then call bower.cmd manually from the command prompt since it isn't added to my environment variables (I think). It doesn't work with just "bower install jquery" like the examples say on its website.
10:39 < SomeoneWeird> add the dir to your env vars then
10:40 < Zol> Even if I call bower.cmd from the command prompt the script isn't eval:d by node.exe.

11:33 < hoodoos> hello, guys!
11:33 < nmosis> i dont answer from the collective
11:33 < hoodoos> is is expected results that for(var key in arr) slower then arr.forEach and for(;;)?
11:33 < hoodoos> http://pastebin.com/NEcC62kL
11:34 < hoodoos> i just did something stupid in my test? :)
11:34 < nmosis> https://www.fbi.gov
11:34 < leichtgewicht> Is the test at http://jsperf.com/?
11:34 < hoodoos> nope… let me try to run it there..
11:35 < nmosis> https://www.fbi.gov
11:35 < RLa> hoodoos, do not use in loop with arrays, you might get properties that are not array elements
11:36 < hoodoos> RLa: yeah, but it's just a test case.. just wonder if it's expected
11:36 < RLa> and yes, i think slowerness is the expected result
11:37 < hoodoos> http://jsperf.com/iterations-compare
11:37 < RLa> 'for in' will also check prototype's properties
11:38 < leichtgewicht> yeah hoodoos, for-in can't be made faster ... a gist for the .foreach test would be nice.
11:39 < hoodoos> .forEach is slower of cause
11:39 < hoodoos> but just 2 times slower then for(;;)
11:39 < RLa> and for the ultimate speed you could precalculate arr.length :)
11:39 < hoodoos> yeah
11:41 < hoodoos> RLa: btw, in my case it's precalcualted :)
11:42 < nmosis> ok go to take "meds"

12:42 < rk8888> What's the best way to implement an authentication system over node? is it better to use a module (which one?) or simply using express sessions by checking against db results?
12:42 < rk8888> (sorry for the dumb question, I'm still a newbie)
12:45 < dhpe> rk8888: im using everyauth. it had quite crappy manuals so it took some time to figure out how it works, but at least it provides an easy way to support facebook/twitter/etc authentication if that is needed.

13:11 < dav_> Came here looking for some aid installing telescope from a mac. I am getting an error node.js:201 process.nextTick error, or 'error' event on first tick 
13:11 < dav_> The step it fails on is installing smart packages
13:11 < dav_> any insights?
13:13 < leichtgewicht> what node version?
13:14 < stagas> dav_: it's a meteor app maybe in #meteor they have some insights
13:16 < dav_> anyone trying to help out a n00b? Ill help your paypal account for some good help. I just want to get this project installed
13:17 < leichtgewicht> dav_: What node version?
13:17 < SomeoneWeird> dav_, pastie the whole error
13:17 < joehoyle> leichtgewicht: sweet that worked, so many callbacks everywhere!
13:18 < dav_> node -v v0.6.10
13:18 < SomeoneWeird> should update to latest
13:18 < dav_> cd Telescope-master/ > mrt  Stand back while Meteorite does it's thing  Installing Meteor    branch: https://github.com/meteor/meteor.git#master  Installing smart packages   node.js:201         throw e; // process.nextTick error, or 'error' event on first tick               ^ There was a problem checking out branch: 067113a37dd4e7824db1a16d5f7a90c3739eed9c
13:18 < stagas> dav_: meteor runs on node but is an entirely different platform, you'll have better luck talking to people who are using it
13:19 < dav_> ok, thanks stagas, I am trying to find the irc channel for it, but nothing yet
13:19 < leichtgewicht> dav_: still it might be a good hint to install a newer version of node.js
13:19 < dav_> I am going to contact developer... its strange because I did the setup on two different machines in two different ways and got the same error
13:19 < stagas> dav_: https://github.com/meteor/meteor#developer-resources
13:20 < dav_> leichtgewicht: brew tells  me thats the latest version?
13:20 < dav_> so this is a meteor issue not a telescope issue?
13:21 < leichtgewicht> dav_ maybe the latest in the brew listing. The latest http://nodejs.org/download/ would be 0.8.15

However, I'm wanting to do this step automaticaly when a file is saved in the source directory. Maybe theres a node module that can run a script after watch

16:44 < distilledchaos> it's not working on any of the browser i've tried (chrome, firefox, safari)
16:45 < hendore> I think I am nearly there, using module called supervisor I can watch a directory for changes and run a bash script
16:45 < hendore> supervisor -w src -e js -p 5000 -x /bin/bash compile.sh
16:45 < hendore> ^^^^ Watch src directory for changes to js files poll every 5 seconds and run compile.sh if anything changes
16:46 < hendore> Any other ways to do this? 
16:46 < distilledchaos> i'm assuming you've seen this: http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_watch_filename_options_listener
16:47 < distilledchaos> it says it's unstable, but i've never had any problems with it
16:49 < hendore> distilledchaos, hmmm I'm guessing it may be better to use the fs module myself and do away with supervisor, the mem+cpu usage is pretty high and even supressing info fills my terminal with blank lines so I have no useful information about changes
16:49 < distilledchaos> hmmm
16:49 < distilledchaos> fs is probably the way to go
16:49 < distilledchaos> but i'd be interested to see if supervisor has a "quiet" mode
16:50 < distilledchaos> like -q or something
16:50 < hendore> yes
16:50 < distilledchaos> even if you're not printing out the info
16:50 < distilledchaos> it could be slowing down the system
16:50 < distilledchaos> eating up ram
16:50 < distilledchaos> not sure...
16:50 < distilledchaos> worth a shot
16:50 < hendore> it removes the DEBUG lines every time it polls for changes, however i just get linebreaks coming out
16:51 < distilledchaos> hmmm
16:51 < hendore> i was expecting the cursor to stay put using -q
16:51 < hendore> but the term just scrolls with empty lines, so when i do save a file in the directory being watched, that information cannot be seen in terminal (to be sure everything went ok)
16:51 < distilledchaos> http://supervisord.org/logging.html <-- is that useful?
16:52 < distilledchaos> odd
16:52 < distilledchaos> i can't really help you with supervisor
16:52 < distilledchaos> but i might be able to help with fs
16:52 < distilledchaos> fs.watch is much nicer--instead of polling it uses the system you're on to listen for filesystem updates
16:53 < distilledchaos> of course, if you're expecting lots of filesystem changes quickly, this might be useful: http://underscorejs.org/#debounce
16:55 < distilledchaos> ravster: i'm assuming you didn't figure anything out?
16:56 -!- mode/#Node.js [+b *!*nmosis@*.static.stls.mo.charter.com] by isaacs
16:56 -!- nmosis was kicked from #Node.js by isaacs [nmosis]
16:56 < hendore> distilledchaos, this module seems to do what I'm looking for https://npmjs.org/package/krunch
16:57 <@isaacs> SomeoneWeird: re: nmosis?  done.
16:58 < distilledchaos> hendore: ah, so that's what you're trying to do
16:58 < distilledchaos> go for it
16:59 < gildean> isaacs: good riddance
17:03 <@isaacs> wow, the dude moved it into pmsg now.
17:03 <@isaacs> this is some deep crazy
17:03  * isaacs is fighting the urge to bait...
17:04  * Sly pushes isaacs over the edge.
17:04 < Sly> You know you want to do it.
17:07 < nathan7> aand substack saves my day again with dnode
17:07  * nathan7 just built a little presentation framework for presentation he has to do for English class
17:08 < nathan7> I can use my phone as a presenter :D
17:08 < distilledchaos> love doing that
17:08 < nathan7> hmm
17:09 < gildean> isaacs: no shit, i think the dude might have some real issues
17:09 < joaojeronimo> What does "~/.node-gyp/0.8.14/src/node_object_wrap.h:71: void node::ObjectWrap::Wrap(v8::Handle<v8::Object>): Assertion `handle->InternalFieldCount() > 0' failed." mean ?
17:10 < distilledchaos> are you using npm?
17:11 <@isaacs> hm.  maybe we should require registered users in this channel.
17:11 <@isaacs> it'd suck for all the bots, though
17:11 <@isaacs> and noobs, i guess.
17:11 <@isaacs> probably worth the occasional crazy person.
17:13 < distilledchaos> @isaacs: i'm guessing this is somebody who came on the irc looking for help?
17:13 < nathan7> Someone completely crazy
17:14 < distilledchaos> it is a little frustrating...asking for help and never getting any...
17:14 < distilledchaos> especially when it looks like so many people are here
17:14 < nathan7> nmosis was shouting shit about the apocalypse and murdering people
17:15 < distilledchaos> ah...
17:15 < pluma> Define "people"
17:15 < distilledchaos> that's a different story
17:15 < nathan7> pluma: Go grep your own logs q=
17:15 < Josh> pluma, Those who are not on internet
17:15 < Josh> are called people
17:15 < distilledchaos> ^
17:15 < nathan7> pluma: http://logs.nodejs.org/node.js/latest#08:39:59.556
17:16 < Josh> distilledchaos, Thats called susy
17:16 < pluma> Josh: Ah, but how can this channel be full of them, then?
17:16 < distilledchaos> we're just sophisticated bots
17:16 < distilledchaos> that's not what i was referring to...
17:16 < Josh> :D
17:16 < nathan7> hmm
17:16 < nathan7> Goddamnit.
17:16 < Josh> pluma, distilledchaos already answered it.
17:16 < nathan7> Now that my slideshow framework works and all
17:16 < nathan7> I have to write *content*
17:16 < distilledchaos> that guy is completely crazy...
17:16 < Josh> :D
17:16 < distilledchaos> the worst part...
17:17 < nathan7> Fuck this :|
17:17 < distilledchaos> have fun :D
17:17 < Josh> <nathan7> Now that my slideshow framework works and all <=== Oh, I thought you'd say... "I don't want it anymore"
17:17 < distilledchaos> what's your presentation supposed to be on?
17:17 < Josh> People.
17:17 < Josh> The rare category of humans.
17:18 < distilledchaos> XD
17:18 < Josh> Most likely in range of 80+ and 5-
17:18 < hendore> distilledchaos, Ended up just writing a quick script to get the job done. http://pastebin.com/ZauiD1N4 using the Fileststem module to watch the src directory, any changes runs compile.sh which basicly concats and uglifys js files and copies the result into public/js 
17:18 < hendore> seems to work ok for now
17:18 <@isaacs> distilledchaos: https://gist.github.com/4246105
17:18 < distilledchaos> that's what i usually do
17:19 < Josh> ahoy isaacs 
17:19 < distilledchaos> yeah i saw
17:19 <@isaacs> Josh: yo
17:19 < Josh> I confused you with some issac few months ago
17:19 < Josh> :D
17:19  * distilledchaos shivers
17:19 < Josh> Missed the last s
17:19 < Josh> heh
17:19 < nathan7> Josh: Nah, it works perfectly. It just needs actual content to show.
17:19 <@isaacs> Josh: also, you turned the first A into an S
17:19 < Josh> Ah
17:19 < Josh> err yea
17:19 <@isaacs> Josh: "isaac" is properly spelled either "isaac" or "yitzach"
17:19 < Josh> heh
17:20 < Josh> O_o
17:20 < Josh> The latter one is not really "obvious" 
17:20 < nathan7> The latter being a transliteration from Hebrew?
17:20 <@isaacs> nathan7: well, really they both are a transliteration of hebrew :)
17:20 <@isaacs> nathan7: the first one is just somewhat more romanized
17:20 <@isaacs> and then anglicized
17:20 < pluma> Gesundheit.
17:21 < nathan7> isaacs: mhm
17:21 < nathan7> People always manage to come up with at least 10 ways to spell my first and last names.
17:21 <@isaacs> in spanish and italian it's isaco, i've heard it's izak in german and yiddish, and some funky cyrillic thing in russian
17:21 < distilledchaos> 10 ways to spell nathan?
17:21 < distilledchaos> that's impressive
17:21 < nathan7> Yeah. It is.
17:22 < pluma> isaacs: It's Isaak in German I think. Definitely not izak.
17:22 < nathan7> And another 10 ways to spell Zadoks.
17:22 <@isaacs> pluma: oh, ok.
17:22 < pluma> It'd be pronounced "ee-tzuhk" otherwise.
17:23 <@isaacs> i grew up always being the only isaac i knew, with rare exception.  so when i hear someone say "isaac" i always assume they're talking to me, even if it's on tv or something.
17:23 <@isaacs> apparently, about 4 years ago, it was a really popular name, though
17:23 <@isaacs> so occasionally now i'll be in a store, and hear "ISAAC!  PUT THAT DOWN.  GET OVER HERE."
17:23 <@isaacs> and i'm *really* confused!
17:23 <@isaacs> "Why is that person yelling at me?" i think, as i timidly put down whatever it was i was holding.
17:24 < distilledchaos> :(
17:24 < pluma> It's not much better to be called "Alan" in a non-anglophonic country.
17:24 < pluma> First of all, most people think it's a girl's name.
17:25 < pluma> Also, maths class was hell. ln this, ln that.
17:25 -!- mode/#node.js [+o piscisaureus_] by ChanServ
17:26 < zomg> Isn't ln pronounced more like ellen though and not alan? :P
17:26 < pluma> zomg: You assume Germans know the difference.
17:26 < zomg> though I can imagine it could be confused if you're not paying much attention
17:26 < zomg> haha
17:26 < distilledchaos> who wouldn't pay attention in math class?
17:30 < pluma> I want something that goes "beep" so I can connect it to my raspberry pi.
17:30 < pluma> Or "bing".
17:31 < distilledchaos> like some sort of speaker?
17:31 < distilledchaos> or something more sophisticated?
17:31 < pluma> Hm... that would do, I guess ;)
17:31 < distilledchaos> like a sibling with a pair of wires attached
17:40 < distilledchaos> well then
17:40 < distilledchaos> i'm trying to deploy a jitsu app
17:41 < distilledchaos> and it's uploading incredibly slowly...
17:55 < nathan7> aand thus I found a new feature to add to my slideshow thingy
17:55 < distilledchaos> yay
17:59 < LEDfan> Pfff. I'm trying to work with sockets.io. My Apache2 server works on port 8080. And I want to make a connection from node to the client in the browser  (on port 8080). But I can't use port 8080 in the require.listen . I know its create a HTTP server. If I use port 8000 for the require.listen, and I go to http://IP:8000/node/file it gives: Welcome to socket.io.. If I go to: http://IP:8080/node/file (my apache2 server)  the js file is not 
17:59 < LEDfan> found.(socket.io/socket.io.js)
18:02 < LEDfan> I don't understand sockets.io. Wich port do I need to file in 'var io = require('socket.io').listen(8000);' ? And on which port do I need to acces the file with the client side javascript? Tnx
18:08 < pluma> If you want to serve the file via socket.io, you need to reference the port it's running on.
18:09 < pluma> i.e. <script src="IP:8000/....">
18:10 < pluma> What exactly are you trying to do? You probably don't need to put Apache in front of node.js. Also, it's not trivial to proxy websockets.
18:10 < ThiefMaster> pluma: you most likely meant src="//IP:8000/..."
18:11 < pluma> ThiefMaster: Yes. Sorry.
18:12 < pyrotechnick> LOL @ logs by nmosis
18:12 < pluma> LEDfan: If you're just trying to play with socket.io, just ignore Apache for the moment and use node.js itself for your webserver.
18:12 < LEDfan> pluma: oh tnx.
18:13 < pluma> pyrotechnick: Schizophrenia I'd guess. Would explain the train of thought and the religious nature of it.
18:13 < pyrotechnick> well i liked it
18:13 < pyrotechnick> ^w^
18:14 < LEDfan> But why do I get Welcome to socket.io. and not my data?
18:15 < LEDfan> Is there maybe a good sockets.io tutorial?
18:16 < pyrotechnick> http://socket.io/#how-to-use
18:16 < LEDfan> Tnx I will try a little more.
18:16 < pyrotechnick> basically you need a index.html
18:16 < pyrotechnick> i usually make a public folder and put it in there and use express like
18:17 < LEDfan> Yeay
18:17 < pyrotechnick> app = express() ; app.use express.static "#{__dirname}/public"
18:17 < pyrotechnick> kinda thing. that's coffee but you get the drift
18:17 < pyrotechnick> there's three other ways on that link i just sent
18:18 < pyrotechnick> all will work
18:18 < pyrotechnick> probably you will learn more / get less confused the first way they explain with the function handler (req, res) { stuff
18:19 < pyrotechnick> but if you start to write a decent sized app i'd grab express at that point
18:19 < pyrotechnick> or at least connect
18:19 < pyrotechnick> but that's overkill if you just want to test out simple socket.io stuff
18:19 < LEDfan> Okay
18:20 < pyrotechnick> first two ways youll only need /{app.js, index.html}
18:21 < pyrotechnick> nice a simple ;)
18:21 < LEDfan> I think I just can't connect to my http server ore something like that.
18:21 < pluma> Nah, just mind the ports.
18:21 < LEDfan> Because I get nothing in mine terminal.
18:23 < LEDfan> So if there is a connection normaly this anonymous function is called: 'io.sockets.on('connection', function (socket) {' and then there are somethings added to the terminal. But there is nothing in the log(terminal)
18:24 < distilledchaos> what debug level are you using?
18:24 < distilledchaos> sorry, log level--not debug level
18:24 < LEDfan> Euh. 
18:25 < LEDfan> console.log('Message'); I just uses this code.
18:25 < distilledchaos> https://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO/wiki/Configuring-Socket.IO
18:25 < distilledchaos> see log level
18:25 < distilledchaos> i'm guessing since you don't know what it is you probably aren't setting it
18:25 < distilledchaos> so it's at log level 3
18:26 < distilledchaos> can you paste your code somewhere (gist.github.com or pastebin)?
18:28 < LEDfan> distilledchaos: http://pastebin.com/kYv9cdMM
18:28 < LEDfan> I'm Trying to set up a connection first.
18:30 < distilledchaos> try changing line 11 to <script src="http://192.168.0.114:8000/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
18:31 < pyrotechnick> how does that client get served?
18:31 < LEDfan> Okay. Fierst I going to reboot my server.
18:31 < LEDfan> pyrotechnick: in the browser
18:31 < pyrotechnick> yeah but what actually serves it?
18:31 < pyrotechnick> what have you saved that file as?
18:32 < LEDfan> Euh .php
18:32 < pyrotechnick> or are you just loading the html into the browser straight off the disk?
18:32 < pyrotechnick> hahaha
18:32 < pyrotechnick> ok
18:32 < LEDfan> Yes
18:32 < pyrotechnick> if u follow the getting started stuff on that page i linked you node will serve a html for you
18:32 < pyrotechnick> and u can do like http://localhost
18:32 < pyrotechnick> but its up to you really
18:33 < distilledchaos> or if your client-side javascript file is on the same server as socket.io, just do var socket = io.connect('/');
18:33 < distilledchaos> and it'll automatically resolve the correct connection
18:33 < distilledchaos> no hastle
18:34 < LEDfan> Oh sorry for the stupid questions. I know It's simple, and I'm doing somehting wrong. :P
18:34 < LEDfan> Thanks for the patient.
18:36 < LEDfan> Its becoming more clear. :P
18:36 < pyrotechnick> like this LEDfan https://gist.github.com/4246406
18:36 < pyrotechnick> if u clone that then run the stuff in README it should work
18:36 < pyrotechnick> i didnt actually test it
18:37 < pyrotechnick> wow socket.io has got alot of dependencies
18:38 < yawnt> A LOT
18:38 < yawnt> er.. hi
18:38 < pyrotechnick> yeah that works
18:38 < LEDfan> Okay. How do I need to acces the index.html?
18:38 < pyrotechnick> once the server is running 
18:38 < pyrotechnick> http://localhost
18:38 < pyrotechnick> you will probably need to sudo unless you're already root
18:38 < LEDfan> Okay.
18:38 < pyrotechnick> anything under 1024 i think needs root on most systems
18:38 < LEDfan> I get a White page with in the source the javascript.
18:38 < pyrotechnick> yeah now check the console
18:39 < LEDfan> failed to load resource http://localhost/socket.io/1/?t=1355081805962
18:39 < LEDfan> That is what in the console.
18:39 < pyrotechnick> wat browser
18:39 < LEDfan> Chromium.
18:39 < pyrotechnick> weird
18:40 < distilledchaos> did you run npm install?
18:40 < LEDfan> Yeay.
18:40 < distilledchaos> just checking
18:40 < pyrotechnick> i dont think the server would have started without, yeah
18:40 < LEDfan>   debug - served static content /socket.io.js
18:40 < LEDfan>    debug - served static content /socket.io.js
18:40 < LEDfan>    debug - served static content /socket.io.js
18:40 < LEDfan>    debug - served static content /socket.io.js
18:40 < LEDfan>    debug - served static content /socket.io.js
18:40 < LEDfan>    debug - served static content /socket.io.js
18:40 < LEDfan>    debug - served static content /socket.io.js
18:40 < LEDfan> Sorry.
18:40 < LEDfan> That's what I get in the terminal where the app.js is started.
18:41 < pyrotechnick> cat node_modules/socket.io/package.json | grep version 
18:41 < distilledchaos> nothing else?
18:41 < pyrotechnick> node -v
18:41 < LEDfan> 0.9.11
18:41 < pyrotechnick> paste the output of those two
18:41 < pyrotechnick> thats good
18:41 < pyrotechnick> and node?
18:41 < LEDfan> 0.9.3
18:41 < distilledchaos> instead of io.connect('http://localhost'); try io.connect('/');
18:41 < LEDfan> I build from source. 
18:41 < distilledchaos> in index.html
18:42 < distilledchaos> you built from source?
18:42 < pyrotechnick> whered u get the source from
18:42 < distilledchaos> hmmm
18:42 < LEDfan> W000000t
18:42 < LEDfan> Its working!
18:42 < pyrotechnick> it work?
18:42 < pyrotechnick> haha
18:42 < pyrotechnick> welcome aboard buddy
18:42 < distilledchaos> nice
18:42 < pyrotechnick> have fun
18:42 < distilledchaos> :D
18:42 < LEDfan> It was the /
18:42 < pyrotechnick> u dont even need the /
18:42 < distilledchaos> thought so
18:42 < distilledchaos> true
18:42 < pyrotechnick> just io.connect() works too
18:42 < pyrotechnick> why is that distilledchaos?
18:42 < distilledchaos> what he said
18:42 < LEDfan> Indeed.
18:42 < pyrotechnick> but why
18:42 < pyrotechnick> what platform LEDfan?
18:43 < LEDfan> pyrotechnick: the server is Debian, the client PC ArchLinux
18:43 < distilledchaos> aha
18:43 < distilledchaos> it's because you assumed he was running it locally
18:43 < distilledchaos> which meant the server wasn't actually localhost
18:43 < pyrotechnick> lol
18:43 < distilledchaos> hardcoding that is usually a bad idea
18:43 < pyrotechnick> i like just connect()
18:44 < distilledchaos> :D
18:44 < pyrotechnick> its pretty intelligent
18:44 < distilledchaos> it is
18:44 < distilledchaos> i said '/' because i'm usually using namespaces
18:44 < pyrotechnick> any reason ur devving remotely LEDfan?
18:44 < pyrotechnick> true
18:44 < distilledchaos> which means i usually use '/namespace'
18:44 < distilledchaos> debian makes it easier to install node/npm?
18:44 < distilledchaos> don't actually know much about archlinux :(
18:45 < pyrotechnick> LEDfan: node -e 'console.log(process.versions)'
18:45 < pyrotechnick> wats that say
18:45 < distilledchaos> https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager
18:46 < distilledchaos> i suppose if you have pacman it's ok
18:46 < distilledchaos> LEDfan did you build socket.io from source or all of node?
18:47 < LEDfan> cat node_modules/socket.io/package.json | grep version
18:47 < pyrotechnick> ◔
18:47 < pyrotechnick> haha
18:47 < LEDfan> { http_parser: '1.0',
18:47 < LEDfan>   node: '0.9.3',
18:47 < LEDfan>   v8: '3.13.7.4',
18:47 < LEDfan>   ares: '1.9.0-DEV',
18:47 < LEDfan>   uv: '0.9',
18:47 < LEDfan>   zlib: '1.2.3',
18:47 < LEDfan>   openssl: '1.0.1c' }
18:47 < pyrotechnick> ok
18:47 < pyrotechnick> r u doing anything serious?
18:47 < LEDfan> distilledchaos: euh from npm.
18:47 < pyrotechnick> or just playing around
18:47 < LEDfan> But the server is Debian. So its verry simple to install things.
18:48 < LEDfan> Just playing. But probably I'm going to do something with it.
18:48 < pyrotechnick> "Keep in mind that stable releases are even-numbered (0.4, 0.6), while unstable releases are odd (0.3, 0.5)."
18:49 < pyrotechnick> as long as you understand if you try to use some modules they might break on 0.9
18:49 < pyrotechnick> because there's no real obligation for package authors to have their stuff work on the latest unstable
18:50 < LEDfan> Oh okay.
18:50 < pyrotechnick> although most the more popular ones do anyway
18:50 < pyrotechnick> like socket.io as you have found out
18:50 < LEDfan> :P
18:50 < pyrotechnick> if anything starts to feel dodgy though try 0.8.15
18:51 < LEDfan> But tnx! I will backup the code, and do some exparimantation.
18:51 < pyrotechnick> awesome
18:51 < pyrotechnick> ill be around, show me what you make
18:51 < LEDfan> Ok
18:57 < LEDfan> Pff I will stop for today. :P
18:57 < distilledchaos> :(
18:58 < pyrotechnick> ;'(
18:58 < LEDfan> Hahahah.
18:58 < LEDfan> Tomorrow is an other day. :P
18:58 < pyrotechnick> may you live forever LEDFan
18:58 < pyrotechnick> may your blade never dull
18:59 < pyrotechnick> may Odin keep you in hells of Valhalla, land of Asgard, until the End of Days 
19:04 < distilledchaos> https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io-client/issues/259 :(
19:04 < someprimetime> when i install node js on my mac, and the instructions are to git clone (from here)
19:04 < someprimetime> should i git clone within my home directory? e.g. ~/
19:04 < someprimetime> ?
19:04 < someprimetime> or does it not matter
19:04 < distilledchaos> you should find some place to store code you're working with
19:05 < distilledchaos> make a dir in ~/ called code or something
19:05 < distilledchaos> and a dir in there for the project you're working on
19:05 < distilledchaos> then cd ~/code/project and git clone
19:05 < distilledchaos> for organizational purposes
19:05 < pyrotechnick> someprimetime: git github app
19:05 < pyrotechnick> http://mac.github.com/
19:06 < someprimetime> niice thanks guys
19:06 < distilledchaos> if you prefer graphical interfaces, then yes.  github is probably the best way to go
19:06 < pyrotechnick> it has defaults i think its like
19:06 < pyrotechnick> ~/github/org/repo
19:06 < pyrotechnick> or something
19:06 < someprimetime> i actually prefer command line (i use vim and screen)
19:07 < pyrotechnick> ive seen peeps use ~/Sites too but sometimes that can screw with apache/web sharing if you use it
19:07 < someprimetime> i store all my site code in ~/Sites
19:07 < pyrotechnick> yeah
19:07 < someprimetime> i've set it up appropriately with apache with no issues (well some that i resolved)
19:07 < pyrotechnick> here most devs also run web sharing though
19:07 < pyrotechnick> yeah
19:07 < someprimetime> now i'm installing yeoman and needed a fresh nose install
19:07 < someprimetime> s/se/de
19:07 < someprimetime> cool ty
19:08 < sayd> are people liking yeoman?
19:08 < pyrotechnick> u on ML someprimetime?
19:08 < someprimetime> sayd: i've used yeoman on my production server and recently setup a local environment because i like it mainly for require/backbone boilerplate code
19:08 < someprimetime> pyrotechnick: ML?
19:09 < pyrotechnick> 10.8
19:09 < someprimetime> pyrotechnick: yeah.. i had node on snow leopard then just upgraded like 2 days ago
19:09 < someprimetime> then i decided to setup a proper deployment setup with github
19:09 < pyrotechnick> theres a preference pane for web sharing if u miss it
19:09 < pyrotechnick> just found it today
19:09 < someprimetime> oh really? i thought i like disappeared
19:10 < someprimetime> couldn't find it
19:10 < pyrotechnick> its gone, yes
19:10 < someprimetime> so i just edited /etc/apache2
19:10 < pyrotechnick> ha
19:10 < someprimetime> and setup everything through that
19:10 < someprimetime> it's not ideal, and tbh i miss all my sudo apt-get on my ubuntu server but the idea of source control for my sites is more important imo
19:11 < someprimetime> i saw this thing called vagrant which looked intriguing though
19:11 < pyrotechnick> i just use brew
19:11 < someprimetime> http://vagrantup.com/
19:11 < someprimetime> maybe i'll use brew
19:11 < pyrotechnick> yeah thats engine yard right?
19:11 < someprimetime> you prefer that over macports?
19:12 < someprimetime> i believe so
19:12 < pyrotechnick> i havent had to use port so much but they always seemed to play ok if u knew what installed what
19:12 < pyrotechnick> if somethings not in brew ive written a recipe
19:12 < pyrotechnick> i also have my own
19:12 < pyrotechnick> but it only does the basics
19:12 < pyrotechnick> i like babushka too
19:12 < pyrotechnick> http://babushka.me/
19:13 < pyrotechnick> my old mate
19:13 < pyrotechnick> mines basically babushka in node
19:13 < someprimetime> noice
19:13 < pyrotechnick> and it outsources to brew and babushka and friends
19:13 < pyrotechnick> but mostly it mounts dmg's cuz im lazy
19:14 < distilledchaos> lazy is just another word for efficient
19:14 < pyrotechnick> true
19:14 < someprimetime> haha that's rad
19:14 < pyrotechnick> but the time i save i use to laze
19:14 < someprimetime> installing homebrew right now actually thanks
19:14 < pyrotechnick> its ok
19:14 < pyrotechnick> RTFM though
19:15 < pyrotechnick> its a bit touchy
19:15 < someprimetime> but i recommend yeoman if you need a lot of scaffolding and do lots of different projects
19:15 < someprimetime> alright nice thanks i appreciate it
19:15 < pyrotechnick> yeah i havent really used yeoman much but im not entirely opposed to these kinda things
19:16 < someprimetime> http://addyosmani.com/blog/the-breakpoint-episode1/
19:16 < someprimetime> nice little intro to it
19:17 < pyrotechnick> man this guy gets around
19:17 < pyrotechnick> this is aerotwist right?
19:18 < superjoe30> say you were looking for an open source media processing server
19:18 < superjoe30> and you found one called "doink"
19:18 < superjoe30> would you be more or less likely to use it?
19:19 < pyrotechnick> doinking sounds like something i'd regret the morning after
19:19 < distilledchaos> yep
19:19 < pyrotechnick> http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=doink
19:19 < distilledchaos> oh my
19:19 < pyrotechnick> ^w^
19:21 < odin_> no no no odin_ doesn't say that, odin_ says stay in heaven on earth (valhalla is cold!)
19:21 < superjoe30> I'm so bad at naming things
19:21 < superjoe30> plz halp
19:21 < distilledchaos> odin_ lolwut
19:21 < pyrotechnick> he was feeding my troll from before
19:22 < distilledchaos> mediablast?
19:22 < superjoe30> ooh
19:22 < odin_> pyrotechnick may Odin keep you in hells of Valhalla, ....
19:22 < pyrotechnick> speedia
19:22 < superjoe30> "Media Blast & Abrasives Inc. is a manufacturer of one of the largest lines of quality Abrasive Blast Cabinets"
19:22 < distilledchaos> streamR
19:22 < distilledchaos> lol
19:22 < distilledchaos> ok, maybe no
19:23 < smlefo> hi all... I am attempting to create web servers via require('http').createServer... they are failing with Address In Use because I am trying to run a lot of them... so I wanted to increase the port number automatically when it fails at one port address... how would I do this?
19:23 < smlefo> e.g., try 12345, fails, 12346, fails, 12347, succeeds
19:23 < distilledchaos> try this on for size: http://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html
19:23 < pyrotechnick> im pretty sure if you dont specify a port it picks a random one
19:23 < distilledchaos> then you can use master-slave communication to find the next port
19:24 < distilledchaos> keep a local variable for the next port number
19:24 < distilledchaos> and use worker.send(portNumber++)
19:24 < distilledchaos> or something
19:24 < superjoe30>  smlefo you should simply not specify the port number
19:24 < superjoe30> err, use 0
19:24 < superjoe30> then a random available one is assigned
19:24 < pyrotechnick> yeah something like that
19:24 < distilledchaos> depends on the application, really
19:24 < smlefo> well, for other reasons, I need the port number to be deterministic
19:24 < superjoe30> then check which one it is with server.address().port
19:24 < distilledchaos> aha
19:24 < pyrotechnick> then on the callback to .listen check what port it was
19:24 < pyrotechnick> yep
19:24 < smlefo> because there is no way for me to communicate the chosen port
19:25 < superjoe30> smlefo, maybe there should be?
19:25 < smlefo> I would love to have something like isThisPortInUse(12345) which returns true/false
19:25 < someprimetime> pyrotechnick: ah not sure i didn't know about pau lewis until i started watching the breakpoint series
19:25 < someprimetime> but he seems pretty cool
19:25 < pyrotechnick> he does webgl
19:25 < someprimetime> that whole crew seems cool
19:25 < superjoe30> smlefo, that api is impossible because it is open to race conditions
19:25 < someprimetime> oh wow
19:25 < someprimetime> nice
19:25 < pyrotechnick> http://www.aerotwist.com/lab/
19:25 < distilledchaos> https://gist.github.com/1689041
19:25 < superjoe30> smlefo, you have to do a try/catch type thing, same as for file exists
19:25 < pyrotechnick> hes working on three.js now
19:25 < distilledchaos> :O
19:26 < smlefo> I tried a try/catch around .listen, but .listen fails in the event loop, outside of the try/catch
19:26 < someprimetime> oh wow. +1
19:26 < superjoe30> smlefo, not try/catch literally, but the idea that you have to try to listen and then handle the error
19:26 < distilledchaos> so what about https://gist.github.com/1689041
19:26 < smlefo> can I catch exceptions that the event loop throws?
19:26 < gavri> how do I differentiate between different exceptions so that I can handle them differently in exception handlers? do JS developers build an exception hierarchy and then use the type to differentiate between approaches to logging/messaging-to-the-user?
19:26 < distilledchaos> or https://github.com/indexzero/node-portfinder
19:26 < superjoe30> smlefo, take another look at the API documentation
19:26 < superjoe30> it clearly explains how to respond to errors
19:27 < distilledchaos> gavri I've never figured that out...
19:27 < pyrotechnick> smlefo: listen is async, forget the throw/catch stuff
19:27 < superjoe30> gavri, node has a convention of using error.code
19:27 < pyrotechnick> This function is asynchronous. The last parameter callback will be added as a listener for the 'listening' event. 
19:27 < smlefo> distilled -- portfinder looks pretty close... thanks
19:28 < distilledchaos> np
19:28 < pyrotechnick> if ur feeling real hardcore try https://github.com/substack/seaport too
19:28 < distilledchaos> superjoe30 what about a weird name
19:28 < distilledchaos> like ablastofmedia
19:28 < pyrotechnick> actually i mean https://github.com/substack/airport
19:28 < superjoe30> I'm thinking Doink Blaster Media Spedia
19:28 < distilledchaos> hahhahaha
19:28 < pyrotechnick> or something
19:28 < distilledchaos> seaport looks fun
19:29 < distilledchaos> might be a bit long
19:29 < pyrotechnick> haha
19:29 < pyrotechnick> dont let substack hear you say that
19:30 < distilledchaos> ?
19:30 < distilledchaos> "Doink Blaser Media Spedia" might be a bit long
19:30 < distilledchaos> not seaport
19:30 < distilledchaos> that was clumsy of me...
19:31 < superjoe30> MediaBlast is quite good
19:31 < superjoe30> actually
19:31 < distilledchaos> are there any modules that could do something like http://time.is (i.e. clock synchronization) to a central server instead of the atomic clock
19:31 < superjoe30> mind if I use it?
19:31 < distilledchaos> :D
19:31 < distilledchaos> go ahead
19:31 < superjoe30> should it be like mediaBlast, media-blast, media blast
19:31 < superjoe30> which?
19:31 < pyrotechnick> distilledchaos: ntp
19:31 < distilledchaos> yeah but for node.js and socket.io
19:32 < distilledchaos> uh
19:32 < distilledchaos> superjoe30: what about mediablast
19:32 < superjoe30> yeah
19:32 < superjoe30> done
19:32 < superjoe30> thanks!
19:32 < pyrotechnick> "Synchronize browser times with a server times through a protocol inspired by the Network Time Protocol "
19:32 < gavri> superjoe30: thanks
19:32 < iksik2> this set of 'fleet/airport/seaport' - pure modules
19:32 < iksik2> plenty of bugs
19:33 < distilledchaos> oh you mean jsntp
19:33 < pyrotechnick> no i mean
19:33 < pyrotechnick> npm i ntp
19:33 < distilledchaos> what's the github repo?
19:33 <@isaacs> iksik2: you are probably right, but you should be more specific, and write github issues.
19:33 < pyrotechnick> yeah its not on github
19:33 < pyrotechnick> its called jsntp yeah
19:33 < pyrotechnick> but its published as ntp
19:34 < distilledchaos> ah, ok
19:34 < distilledchaos> what about socket-ntp?
19:34 < distilledchaos> something with documentation
19:35 < smlefo> awesome -- portfinder works beautifully, very easy: http://pastebin.com/iCUrdM7D
19:35 < smlefo> thanks guys
19:35 < distilledchaos> no problem
19:35 < superjoe30> nice, glad that worked out for you
19:35 < pyrotechnick> i actually have to tackle this shit today distilledchaos
19:36 < pyrotechnick> weird coincidence
19:36 < distilledchaos> what shit are we referring to?
19:36 < distilledchaos> almost said refering...
19:36 < pyrotechnick> syncing times
19:37 < distilledchaos> oh joy :D
19:37 < pyrotechnick> i guess when i do that ill put socket.io in this app
19:37 < distilledchaos> i wrote my own ServerTime class
19:37 < pyrotechnick> and my favourite line which ive missed alot devving this
19:37 < pyrotechnick> socket.on 'reconnect', -> window.location.reload()
19:37 < distilledchaos> oh boy
19:37 < pyrotechnick> like a boss
19:37 < mscdex> anyone notice a lot of github fork spam?
19:37 < pyrotechnick> nope?
19:38 < superjoe30> mscdex, I do
19:38 < pyrotechnick> distributed denial of forking?
19:38 < mscdex> i just had like 11 different accounts fork the same module all within the same minute 
19:38 < superjoe30> people who don't really write code seem to fork a bunch of my projects
19:38 < superjoe30> oh
19:38 < distilledchaos> pyrotechnick: https://gist.github.com/4246667
19:38 < pyrotechnick> its develpbipolar
19:38 < superjoe30> someone probably posted a link to your project, right?
19:39 < mscdex> doubtful
19:39 < pyrotechnick> this is nice distilledchaos
19:39 < mscdex> most people do starring, not forking
19:39 < distilledchaos> then on the server socket.on('ping', function(fn) {_.isFunction(fn) && fn(Date.now());});
19:39 < distilledchaos> thx
19:39 < mscdex> they're all organizations
19:39 < pyrotechnick> i think yeoman confused about what it is
19:40 < superjoe30> mscdex, weird. I've never experienced that.
19:40 < mscdex> scraping, Hosting-Scripts, OpenHosts, BigData-Tools, hosts, Big-Data, OpenSource-, mapping, Open-Source-GIS, LeadsPlus, netcon-source
19:40 < distilledchaos> oh wow
19:41 < pyrotechnick> socket.on 'ping', (fn) -> fn? Date.now()
19:41 < pyrotechnick> :p
19:41 < mscdex> :/
19:41 < distilledchaos> pyrotechnick never actually learned coffeescript
19:41 < distilledchaos> spent too much time working with regular jscript
19:41 < pyrotechnick> i started doin some js again before this gig
19:41 < distilledchaos> but i added a file to the gist
19:41 < pyrotechnick> and also some livescript
19:41 < pyrotechnick> but they're using it here so
19:41 < pyrotechnick> im happy
19:41 < distilledchaos> heh
19:41 < jhsto> Do you guys know how I can make sure a websocket is ready and connected once it has changed it's transport?
19:42 < distilledchaos> i sorta like it but i feel like it should allow c-style syntax
19:42 < distilledchaos> the best feature for me is classes instead of prototypes
19:42 < jhsto> I can't find anything solid from the socket object.
19:42 < distilledchaos> what exactly are you trying to do?
19:43 < distilledchaos> like socket.on('connect', function() {}); ?
19:43 < jhsto> No, but console.log(socket)
19:44 < jhsto> And there, socket.socket.connected for an example
19:44 < jhsto> It shows when the socket is connected, but if it decides to change the transport it wont work
19:44 < distilledchaos> does socket.io change transports after the initial connect
19:44 < distilledchaos> or are you manually forcing it to do that?
19:45 < distilledchaos> i've never seen it do so by itself (after initial connect)
19:45 < pyrotechnick> someprimetime: im gunna try yeoman next project, thanks mate
19:45 < pyrotechnick> this is a great video
19:45 < someprimetime> pyrotechnick: np yeah i'm excited that they started this breakpoint series. good stuff all around
19:46 < jhsto> The transport change occurs when I'm browsing trough proxy
19:46 < pyrotechnick> someprimetime: have you used angular?
19:46 < jhsto> It changes from websocket to xhr-polling. I'm using socket.io
19:46 < distilledchaos> hmmm
19:47 < distilledchaos> https://github.com/learnboost/socket.io-client#events
19:47 < distilledchaos> does that help?
19:47 < jhsto> And it surely made the same thing for couple of other people yesterday, all got angry because their browser did not hookup and the server would have needed the data
19:47 < distilledchaos> if it's not there, i don't really know
19:47 < someprimetime> pyrotechnick: nah but i've read up on it and attended the html5 conference talk by some of the angular team
19:47 < someprimetime> too much automagic stuff in it so i decided to go with backbone 
19:47 < jhsto> I wish it would, but it aint.
19:47 < someprimetime> i'm pretty new to backbone though but i like it
19:47 < jhsto> I'll keep on searching
19:48 < distilledchaos> :(
19:48 < distilledchaos> ok
19:48 < pyrotechnick> we have transcended backbone
19:48 < pyrotechnick> but im a bit tired of rewriting rails
19:48 < pyrotechnick> it was good fun but
19:48 < pyrotechnick> takes a long time
19:48 < distilledchaos> never actually bothered using backbone
19:48 < distilledchaos> is it useful?
19:49 < pyrotechnick> its ok for small-med stuff
19:49 < pyrotechnick> gets a bit fucked with larger stuff
19:49 < distilledchaos> ah, ok
19:49 < someprimetime> distilledchaos: i like it since it's kind of consistent pattern for organizing your code
19:49 < someprimetime> pyrotechnick:  check into https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette
19:49 < pyrotechnick> its not too good at the inception kinda nested model stuff
19:49 < pyrotechnick> yeah we've taken these for a spin
19:49 < pyrotechnick> i just think its a pain stacking frameworks
19:49 < pyrotechnick> we really do need a large framework atm
19:50 < pyrotechnick> id rather just take something more fullstack TBH
19:50 < pyrotechnick> at least for these projects coming up
19:50 < pyrotechnick> generally i dont feel this way but we need to get stuff out the door stat.
19:50 < someprimetime> agreed
19:50 < distilledchaos> good luck
19:51 < pyrotechnick> yeah i think well need it
19:51 < distilledchaos> never actually had a very large project :/
19:51 < pyrotechnick> yeah i havent had anything this big either
19:52 < distilledchaos> what kind of project is it?
19:52 < pyrotechnick> and we'll have 2-3 of these for the forseeable furture
19:52 < distilledchaos> O.o
19:52 < pyrotechnick> its a bit of one of those "god" apps
19:52 < pyrotechnick> for law firms
19:52 < distilledchaos> a "god" app, huh
19:52 < distilledchaos> ah
19:53 < pyrotechnick> yeah we have a startup here masquerading as the tech department of a law firm
19:53 < distilledchaos> congrats...?
19:53 < pyrotechnick> its early days
19:53 < distilledchaos> nice
19:53 < pyrotechnick> but i can see how it could work
19:54 < pyrotechnick> we're writing their stuff as SAAS and then deploying it for them
19:54 < distilledchaos> stressful but good, i suppose
19:54 < pyrotechnick> ive been pulling 20 hour days
19:54 < pyrotechnick> for 2 weeks
19:54 < distilledchaos> getting paid overtime, i hope
19:54 < pyrotechnick> launching some stuff in the morning then i get some time off ^w^
19:54 < pyrotechnick> nah
19:54 < distilledchaos> :(
19:54 < pyrotechnick> but we will work something out soon with that side of things
19:54 < pyrotechnick> ATM im just rocking out
19:54 < pyrotechnick> not too worried about the politics
19:54 < distilledchaos> yay immersion
19:54 < pyrotechnick> yep
19:54 < distilledchaos> and coding
19:54 < pyrotechnick> and training the monkeys
19:55 < distilledchaos> that part's less fun
19:55 < pyrotechnick> they're good at their own stuff and general they just need to learn the way of the node
19:55 < pyrotechnick> i dont mind it if i dont have too much on my plate
19:55 < pyrotechnick> but it can be hard to juggle yeah
19:55 < pyrotechnick> i do enjoy it though
19:55 < pyrotechnick> and besides, ladies ^w^
19:55 < pyrotechnick> so it makes it a bit easier :)
19:55 < distilledchaos> haha
19:55 < pyrotechnick> they're killer front-enders
19:56 < jhsto> Lol how awful this is, it takes 20 seconds for websocket to change its transport
19:56 < pyrotechnick> yuck
19:56 < pyrotechnick> have 2 sockets
19:56 < pyrotechnick> on the different transports
19:56 < pyrotechnick> then swap
19:56 < pyrotechnick> LOL
19:56 < jhsto> lol
19:56 < distilledchaos> actually that might work...
19:56 < pyrotechnick> im joking
19:56 < pyrotechnick> thats foul
19:56 < distilledchaos> :p
19:56 < pyrotechnick> if i opened a script and saw that
19:56 < pyrotechnick> id quit
19:57 < superjoe30> pyrotechnick, where do you work
19:57 < superjoe30> that you have such high standards
19:57 < pyrotechnick> just a startup some old friends setup 3 or so months ago
19:57 < distilledchaos> heh
19:57 < pyrotechnick> ahh we
19:57 < pyrotechnick> have learned not to take too many shortcuts
19:57 < pyrotechnick> we outsource a bit too so
19:57 < distilledchaos> yeah
19:57 < distilledchaos> trying to do things the right way
19:57 < pyrotechnick> its a bit hard to do that with voodoo
19:57 < distilledchaos> taken me a few years
19:57 < pyrotechnick> we still have plenty of voodoo
19:58 < pyrotechnick> but where it belongs
19:58 < pyrotechnick> not everywhere
19:58 < superjoe30> it's funny, I noticed that a lot of the nasty code I have to deal with comes from people trying to do it the "right way" and being horribly bad at knowing what the right way is
19:58 < distilledchaos> very true
19:58 < pyrotechnick> be as tricky as you want in framworks
19:58 < pyrotechnick> and stuff in node_modules
19:58 < pyrotechnick> but in the apps
19:58 < superjoe30> if they would have just done it the "dumb way" it would have been easier to refactor the right way
19:58 < pyrotechnick> we've found its not actually a shortcut
19:59 < pyrotechnick> it takes too long to get everyone on the same page
19:59 < pyrotechnick> its too hard to doc
19:59 < pyrotechnick> and the docs read as complex as the code
19:59 < superjoe30> sounds like you're getting close to some of the zen of python
19:59 < distilledchaos> a few years ago i made a library of functions using $ as the main object and named all of the methods single characters
19:59 < superjoe30> explicit over implicit
19:59 < distilledchaos> it was hell to decipher a year later
19:59 < pyrotechnick> yeah i love that 
19:59 < pyrotechnick> its like a cli switch right?
19:59 < pyrotechnick> to print that?
20:00 < pyrotechnick> distilledchaos: lololololol
20:00 < pyrotechnick> i still do that for my personal stuff
20:00 < superjoe30> it prints when you import a certain lib
20:00 < pyrotechnick> true
20:00 < superjoe30> import this
20:00 < pyrotechnick> distilledchaos: in my little toy apps i have classes like Cosmos and Hypervisor and shit
20:00 < distilledchaos> heh
20:00 < pyrotechnick> nothing anyone else would ever understand
20:00 < pyrotechnick> but it works for me
20:00 < distilledchaos> Lemonade
20:01 < pyrotechnick> haha yeah
20:01 < distilledchaos> GreenGrass
20:01 < distilledchaos> yay
20:01 < pyrotechnick> class AfterLife
20:01 < distilledchaos> haha
20:01 < superjoe30> reminds me of high school where we named everything "gString"
20:01 < pyrotechnick> class Revelation
20:01 < pyrotechnick> LOL
20:01 < distilledchaos> superjoe30 i'm still in high school...
20:01 < pyrotechnick> catch gString
20:01 < superjoe30> haha
20:01 < superjoe30> distilledchaos, nice, I wish I knew about IRC in high school
20:01 < superjoe30> ...and had something other than dial up internet
20:02 < distilledchaos> yeah
20:02 < distilledchaos> it's a different time
20:02 < superjoe30> wtf I'm the old person now
20:02 < distilledchaos> of course, it helps growing up in a family of engineers
20:02 < distilledchaos> hahaha
20:02 < pyrotechnick> im 23 i feel about 11 generations older than the 19 year old noder here
20:02 < superjoe30> <-- 24
20:02 < distilledchaos> i've been coding since before i entered any sort of formal school
20:02 < distilledchaos> <-- 17
20:02 < distilledchaos> :p
20:02 < superjoe30> distilledchaos, do they have any programming  courses at your school? what language(s)?
20:03 < distilledchaos> we have a pretty strong computer science program
20:03 < distilledchaos> my fourth year
20:03 < pyrotechnick> sometimes i dont even think he understands half of what i say
20:03 < distilledchaos> first year python
20:03 < pyrotechnick> im like not cool enough or something
20:03 < superjoe30> ha
20:03 < superjoe30> wow that's great
20:03 < distilledchaos> :/
20:03 < distilledchaos> 2nd and 3rd java
20:03 < distilledchaos> this year independent study
20:03 < gildean> i started ircing when i was 12, that's ..... 16 years ago, damn i'm getting old
20:03 < distilledchaos> doing some neurobiology
20:03 < distilledchaos> heh
20:03 < superjoe30> at mine we had only java, and the instructor didn't understand it at all, so it was basically me explaining compile errors to everybody :-(
20:04 < pyrotechnick> man we had this conversation at lunch today
20:04 < pyrotechnick> i tutored at my uni
20:04 < distilledchaos> our instructor is quite the veteran
20:04 < pyrotechnick> it was so terrible
20:04 < distilledchaos> he's also inherited a lot of coding
20:04 < pyrotechnick> 1st year programming -> dr scheme
20:04 < distilledchaos> he writes a cluster-based scheduling system
20:04 < pyrotechnick> like, ok, sure, lisp, but not 1st year
20:04 < pyrotechnick> it turned away everyone
20:04 < distilledchaos> :(
20:04 < jhsto> i live in 9k town and there is no opportunity to study cs even though im at second grade school
20:04 < jhsto> not even online
20:04 < gildean> jhsto: coursera?
20:04 < distilledchaos> had to got to private school to get this education :(
20:04 < superjoe30> jhsto, MIT online courseware?
20:05 < distilledchaos> usa public schools are something of a joke...
20:05 < superjoe30> yeah
20:05 < pyrotechnick> daycare
20:05 < superjoe30> agreed
20:05 < distilledchaos> lol
20:05 < jhsto> im just fine testing things out by my own, as i have done this far
20:05 < jhsto> i have codeschool pass though
20:05 < pyrotechnick> i think best way is just chillin in here answering questions
20:05 < distilledchaos> my method of programming: create a problem, then solve it
20:05 < pyrotechnick> trying to answer everyone
20:05 < jhsto> and then there are those open courses on app store
20:06 < pyrotechnick> it gets u really good at pulling down different versions of things and quickly hacking around too
20:06 < distilledchaos> yeah
20:06 < pyrotechnick> and like
20:06 < pyrotechnick> being aware of your environment
20:06 < pyrotechnick> and those subtle differences
20:06 < distilledchaos> my school has a first robotics team
20:07 < distilledchaos> so i get plenty of practice
20:07 < pyrotechnick> man can node run on mindstorms yet?
20:07 < distilledchaos> hahaw
20:07 < distilledchaos> frc
20:07 < distilledchaos> not fll
20:07 < distilledchaos> i manage our competitive analysis department
20:07 < distilledchaos> we've structured our team like a small company
20:07 < pyrotechnick> yeah us too its
20:07 < distilledchaos> we got a donation of 6 3g ipads
20:07 < pyrotechnick> interesting
20:07 < timeturner> distilledchaos: where is your team located?
20:08 < distilledchaos> portland, oregon
20:08 < distilledchaos> if you wanted you could probably figure out who i am
20:08 < pyrotechnick> weve been trying to use github issue tracker this week but i dunno
20:08 < pyrotechnick> weve been using the whiteboard since saturday and it seems better TBH
20:08 < distilledchaos> there aren't a ton of private schools with robotics teams in portland oregon
20:09 < distilledchaos> and i'm the only one who understands much in terms of node
20:09 < pyrotechnick> how do u assign tasks
20:09 < timeturner> I use plain notebook paper...then once I've solidified the concept I draw it on a whiteboard
20:09 < pyrotechnick> yeah
20:09 < pyrotechnick> what about tasks
20:09 < distilledchaos> is it bad if i just keep everything in my head :/
20:09 < timeturner> nope
20:09 < pyrotechnick> well
20:09 < pyrotechnick> it doesnt work
20:09 < jhsto> i do that too distilled
20:09 < pyrotechnick> if u have a team
20:09 < distilledchaos> fair enough
20:09 < timeturner> head has the fastest access rate :P
20:09 < pyrotechnick> it takes too much time
20:09 < distilledchaos> heh
20:09 < distilledchaos> ram vs tape drive
20:09 < pyrotechnick> even if u list them on issue tracker
20:10 < timeturner> you should probably write it down though
20:10 < pyrotechnick> i still get skyped
20:10 < pyrotechnick> or bonjour or watever
20:10 < pyrotechnick> or tapped on the shoulder like
20:10 < pyrotechnick> what does this issue actually mean
20:10 < distilledchaos> haha
20:10 < pyrotechnick> how should we do it etc.
20:10 < distilledchaos> no matter how well you write it
20:11 < pyrotechnick> i dunno if theres even " a way "
20:11 < pyrotechnick> im not really convinced
20:11 < pyrotechnick> i've seen alot of shit tried
20:11 < superjoe30> I find that if you create the correct abstraction layers, the amount of work it takes to keep it all in your head is smaller
20:11 < pyrotechnick> THQ was kinda cool it was the most effective "agile" ive seen
20:11 < pyrotechnick> but even then
20:11 < superjoe30> but the (converse?) is true as well. if you create the *wrong* abstraction layers, it becomes *more* difficult to keep it all in your head
20:11 < pyrotechnick> we had to gantt everything
20:11 < pyrotechnick> and it seemed overkill
20:12 < pyrotechnick> superjoe30: truth ^
20:12 < distilledchaos> for the fabrication/design side of the team we use gantt
20:12 < pyrotechnick> TBH i really like gantt
20:12 < distilledchaos> or rather our mentor does it and the fab team mostly ignores it
20:12 < pyrotechnick> but all the software sucks
20:12 < distilledchaos> yeah i haven't found any software that works well...
20:12 < pyrotechnick> nothing. ever.
20:12 < distilledchaos> plenty that promises the world
20:13 < pyrotechnick> yep
20:13 < distilledchaos> and hands you an old chicken leg
20:13 < pyrotechnick> yep
20:13 < distilledchaos> sigh...
20:13 < pyrotechnick> it needs to be written on like a game engine
20:13 < distilledchaos> ooo
20:13 < djazz> how can I in node.js extract the palette/colortable of a png/gif image?
20:13 < pyrotechnick> djazz: there's a module
20:13 < djazz> what modules
20:13 < pyrotechnick> visionmedia has one
20:14 < pyrotechnick> i think it uses nodecanvas but it might be c too
20:14 < distilledchaos> https://github.com/hacksparrow/node-easyimage
20:14 < pyrotechnick> there's a bunch
20:14 < distilledchaos> search around
20:14 < distilledchaos> you'll find something
20:14 < pyrotechnick> palette           Image color palette with node-canvas                    =tjholowaychuk 
20:15 < pyrotechnick> there's also apis i think colorlovers has one
20:15 < pyrotechnick> if u need to get real hardcore
20:15 < distilledchaos> https://github.com/visionmedia/palette
20:15 < pyrotechnick> thats the one
20:16 < djazz> :l
20:16 < djazz> it doesnt do what i want
20:16 < djazz> i want the palette from he file
20:16 < pyrotechnick> u want all the colors?
20:16 < djazz> not from the image
20:16 < djazz> yes, all 256 of them
20:16 < djazz> in correct order
20:16 < pyrotechnick> itll be in node-canvas somewhere
20:16 < jhsto> distilledchaos, the socket problem got solved - I used the socket object, but I had to re-open the tab for some reason
20:16 < pyrotechnick> cairo
20:17 < jhsto> The dom did not update or something like that idk
20:17 < djazz> canvas api dont support palettes
20:17 < pyrotechnick> no under that
20:18 < djazz> :P
20:20 < djazz> pyrotechnick: i find nothing related to indexed colors there
20:20 < pyrotechnick> can graphicsmagick imagemagick do it you think?
20:21 < djazz> imagemagick on commandline can extract a histogram of colors used, but not the palette
20:21 < djazz> the imagemagick module is just a wrapper usong child_process
20:22 < djazz> i tried node-gd (the recent version), but i cant get it to compile on windows
20:22 < pyrotechnick> ha
20:22 < djazz> if i want to distibute it
20:22 < djazz> it compiles, but i cant use the API
20:22 < djazz> function calls do nothing
20:23 < djazz> im porting a image-gd based utility from php
20:24 < pyrotechnick> shell out to batch scripts that remote adobe photoshop
20:24 < djazz> xD
20:25 < pyrotechnick> im pretty sure thats how you do it in windows
20:25 < jhsto> I've been playing with websockets for a while, what you think: http://jaudu.net/
20:25 < pyrotechnick> or u cud just get ur internet explorer to activex control microsoft excel
20:26 < distilledchaos> oh yeah
20:27 < distilledchaos> let's automate photoshop :D
20:27 < djazz> pyrotechnick: could I use https://github.com/rbranson/node-ffi to use GD? or similar
20:27 < djazz> or libpng
20:27 < pyrotechnick> are they c?
20:27 < djazz> yeah..
20:27 < pyrotechnick> then sure
20:27 < pyrotechnick> it worked well for bullet when i used it
20:28 < pyrotechnick> although
20:28 < pyrotechnick> i did get a massive amount of segfaults
20:28 < pyrotechnick> while i was learning how to use it
20:28 < djazz> hm
20:28 < pyrotechnick> not fun
20:28 < djazz> yeah
20:28 < pyrotechnick> that was mainly me being a noob
20:29 < distilledchaos> somehow managed to get a segfault using nothing but http and the repl
20:29 < pyrotechnick> openssl
20:29 < pyrotechnick> oh maybe not
20:29 < distilledchaos> not https
20:29 < pyrotechnick> readline?
20:29 < pyrotechnick> something dodgy
20:29 < distilledchaos> nothing special
20:29 < distilledchaos> just a standard http server
20:29 < distilledchaos> reported it, naturally
20:30 < pyrotechnick> did u gdb it?
20:30 < distilledchaos> gdb?
20:30 < pyrotechnick> gnu debugger
20:30 < distilledchaos> ah
20:30 < pyrotechnick> stack
20:30 < distilledchaos> it was a remote server
20:31 < pyrotechnick> disassembly
20:31 < distilledchaos> and i had few previlages
20:31 < pyrotechnick> hax0r
20:31 < distilledchaos> ...
20:31 < distilledchaos> lol
20:31 < pyrotechnick> machine code
20:31 < pyrotechnick> binary
20:31 < distilledchaos> school gave me access to a couple webservers
20:31 < pyrotechnick> bits
20:31 < distilledchaos> no
20:31 < distilledchaos> butterfly
20:31 < pyrotechnick> conciousness
20:31 < distilledchaos> http://xkcd.com/378/
20:32 < distilledchaos> also get a segfault a few days ago on cloud9
20:32 < distilledchaos> https://gist.github.com/4181247
20:32 < pyrotechnick> Real programmers set the universal constants at the start such that the universe evolves to contain the disk with the data they want.
20:32 < distilledchaos> :D
20:32 < djazz> hmm
20:32 < pyrotechnick> i must have missed that memo
20:32 < pyrotechnick> otherwise my mmo would be done by now
20:32 < distilledchaos> hmm?  that doesn't sound like success
20:32 < distilledchaos> haha
20:32 < djazz> can i somehow use the windows api through wine? or must i run node in wine?
20:33 < distilledchaos> mmo based on socket.io and three.js?
20:33 < pyrotechnick> hah dude
20:33 < djazz> :)
20:33 < pyrotechnick> not three
20:33 < pyrotechnick> but yeah webgl
20:33 < distilledchaos> aww
20:33 < pyrotechnick> http://youtube.com/user/pyrotechnick
20:33 < distilledchaos> but three is so easy
20:33 < distilledchaos> oh nice
20:33 < pyrotechnick> yeah but theres already so many layers
20:33 < pyrotechnick> and its not the best JS
20:34 < pyrotechnick> its only cuz this is such a pet project
20:34 < superjoe30> are there any node modules to help build a service that has to issue api keys and validate signed requests and such?
20:34 < pyrotechnick> if it were client stuff id just smash it out in three sure
20:34 < pyrotechnick> or lightgl or something
20:34 < distilledchaos_> should make it compatible with minecraft's protocol
20:34 < distilledchaos_> for some reason it dc'd me :(
20:34 < pyrotechnick> yeah
20:34 < djazz> pyrotechnick: http://djazz.mine.nu/lab/minecraft_items/
20:34 < pyrotechnick> i wanna interface gmod somehow eventually too
20:34 < superjoe30> whoa
20:34 < pyrotechnick> oh fuck dude
20:34 < distilledchaos_> ooo
20:34 < pyrotechnick> this is yours?
20:34 < distilledchaos_> that's pretty
20:34 < djazz> (might look ugly on some GPUs) http://djazz.mine.nu/lab/glow/minecraft/
20:34 < pyrotechnick> we should join forces!
20:35 < superjoe30> this is trippy
20:35 < djazz> :D
20:35 < cerial> can i do this in express: app.set('views', __dirname+'views/*/views'); ?
20:35 < pyrotechnick> dude
20:35 < pyrotechnick> <3
20:35 < djazz> notch tweeted about the items/steve running
20:35 < pyrotechnick> mancrush
20:35 < distilledchaos_> cerial not that i know of
20:35 < distilledchaos_> lol
20:35 < distilledchaos_> i implemented minecraft's protocol in node
20:35 < distilledchaos_> don't have the src handy
20:35 < pyrotechnick> we should all fucking join forces
20:35 < cerial> any way i could get the same effect?
20:35 < niggler> why are LPSTRs and LPWSTRs null terminated?
20:35 < distilledchaos_> also wasn't very pretty
20:35 < distilledchaos_> that'd be awesome
20:35 < superjoe30> he's synchronized to the music I'm listening to
20:35 < distilledchaos_> lol
20:35 < niggler> if you are going to prefix with length, there's no need to null terminate
20:36 < djazz> pyrotechnick: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/minecraft-skin-preview/abdidfhdgkoepjlnnnbmjahnlhbjgfgp
20:36 < superjoe30> 140BPM ftw
20:36 < djazz> lol
20:36 < distilledchaos_> cerial iterate through the directories?
20:36 < distilledchaos_> do they change after startup?
20:36 < cerial> yes
20:36 < pyrotechnick> howd u get it to render so fubar djazz?
20:36 < distilledchaos_> hmmm
20:36 < djazz> superjoe30, pyrotechnick: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFV754EpDro
20:37 < djazz> fubar?
20:37 < distilledchaos_> pyrotechnick this was incredibly useful http://www.wiki.vg/Protocol
20:37 < superjoe30> niggler, don't even get me started on the minecraft protocol
20:37 < superjoe30> notch is terrible
20:37 < distilledchaos_> it's pretty bad
20:37 < superjoe30> I'd know. https://github.com/superjoe30/mineflayer
20:37 < distilledchaos_> oh wow
20:37 < pyrotechnick> what the actual fuck
20:37 < distilledchaos_> that was you?
20:38 < distilledchaos_> yay i quit
20:38 < djazz> ;d
20:38 < distilledchaos_> i want my name back
20:38 < superjoe30> that was before I knew about node.js, too bad
20:38 < superjoe30> project might not have died had we used node.js
20:38 < distilledchaos> there we go
20:39 < pyrotechnick> so i code minecraft alone for 2 years then theres just like 3 minecraft coding noders hanging out
20:39 < pyrotechnick> typical
20:39 < distilledchaos> yep
20:39 < superjoe30> there's a good channel for you guys
20:39 < distilledchaos> it's how the universe works
20:39 < niggler> superjoe30 lol dealing with xls
20:39 < superjoe30> #mcdevs
20:39 < distilledchaos> Oo
20:39 < pyrotechnick> true?
20:39 < pyrotechnick> brb
20:39 < niggler> make a better game superjoe30
20:40 < niggler> i want to see a game like starfox
20:40 < superjoe30> I plan to
20:40 < superjoe30> xls?
20:40 < niggler> excel
20:40 < distilledchaos> ^
20:40 < distilledchaos> ah
20:40 < niggler> and doc
20:40 < superjoe30> when did I deal with xls?
20:40 < niggler> oh no superjoe30 im dealing with xls
20:40 < djazz> pyrotechnick: http://djazz.mine.nu/apps/Minecraft2D/
20:40 < djazz> :)
20:40 < niggler> which is where the length prefixed strings come up
20:41 < distilledchaos> eww
20:41 < superjoe30> niggler, ahhhh
20:41 < distilledchaos> davidbowieslefte huh?
20:41 < superjoe30> niggler, I've made a few games
20:41 < niggler> superjoe30 are you john carmack?
20:42 < superjoe30> no I'm Andrew Kelley
20:42  * niggler facepalms
20:43  * superjoe30 trollface
20:43 < distilledchaos> but why
20:44 < distilledchaos> i got a minecraft server working in node once
20:44 < distilledchaos> then node updated the protocol T.T
20:44 < niggler> screw minecraft
20:44 < distilledchaos> and by node i meant notch...
20:44 < superjoe30> the worst thing is that packets are not prefixed by the packet length
20:44 < superjoe30> so you have to understand the entire protocol in order to use a little bit of it
20:45 < superjoe30> and updates ALWAYS break everything
20:45 < distilledchaos> yeah
20:45 < superjoe30> gonna ask my question one more time just in case...
20:46 < distilledchaos> ooo ooo pick e
20:46 < superjoe30> are there any node modules to help build a service that has to issue api keys and validate signed requests and such?
20:46 < distilledchaos> me*
20:46 < distilledchaos> hmmm
20:47 < distilledchaos> not that i can think of
20:47 < superjoe30> maybe oauth is what I want?
20:47 < distilledchaos> or openid
20:47 < niggler> npm oauth2-provider
20:47 < distilledchaos> as a client, http://passportjs.org/ is nice
20:47 < distilledchaos> but it doesn't do any serving...
20:47 < distilledchaos> wonder what it's dependencies are
20:47 < distilledchaos> its*
20:48 < niggler> unless you want ssl keys superjoe30 in which case i thought mscdex is working on soemthing
20:48 < distilledchaos> reflexive grammar nazi
20:50 < distilledchaos> ooo
20:50 < distilledchaos> just noticed
20:50 < distilledchaos> that github has an education account thingy
20:50 < distilledchaos> http://github.com/edu
20:50 < superjoe30> I'm taking advantage of that
20:50 < superjoe30> quite handy
20:50 < distilledchaos> you'd think i'd have figured that out by now
20:50 < distilledchaos> i've had an .edu account for four years...
20:51 < superjoe30> also bitbucket has unlimited private git repos
20:53 < mscdex> niggler: eh?
20:53 < niggler> oh i thought you were working on some ssl stuff mscdex
20:53 < niggler> high-five nonetheless
20:53 < mscdex> ssh :-)
20:54 < superjoe30> so http basic auth sucks
20:54 < superjoe30> but if you use it with SSL, you should be golden, right?
20:54 < niggler> oh ssh not ssl :/
20:56 < djazz> pyrotechnick: im going with ffi, instant segfault! :D
20:57 < distilledchaos> superjoe30: yeah i knew about bitbuckt
20:57 < distilledchaos> bucket*
20:57 < distilledchaos> because it would auto-approve
21:03 < djazz> anyone here familiar or have used node-ffi?
21:03 < djazz> https://github.com/rbranson/node-ffi
21:04 < TehShrike1> Oh now that is just hawt
21:06 < distilledchaos> that's pretty sweet
21:06 < distilledchaos> no experience with it, tho
21:06 < niggler> djazz check out execSync as a very simple example
21:07 < djazz> im trying to access libgd
21:07 < djazz> eh?
21:07 < niggler> djazz are you sure it doesnt exist?
21:07 < niggler> gd                    Node.js bindings for gd graphics library
21:08 < djazz> niggler: its kinda outdated
21:08 < djazz> doesnt compile anymore
21:10 < niggler> what errors do you get?
21:11 < distilledchaos> relevant? https://github.com/taggon/node-gd
21:12 < djazz> distilledchaos: its outdated
21:12 < djazz> niggler: i found a version that does compile, but nothing happens when i use the functions
21:13 < distilledchaos> :/
21:17 < TehShrike1> substack: have you read The Little Prince?
21:18 < distilledchaos> so i'm using node-mongodb-native for my mongodb needs.  are there any good modules that add support for models?  i tried mongoose a while ago and found it quite buggy.
21:22 < cerial> 'unexpected reserved word' nice error
21:22 < ravster> Hello everyone
21:23 < distilledchaos> ohai
21:23 < ravster> Which cors system in node is most actively developed?
21:23 < superjoe30> I've been using https://github.com/antono/connect-cors
21:23 < superjoe30> works fine
21:24 < jarek> what is the preferred way for getting namespaced attribute value in HTML5 documents?  $0.getAttribute('xlink:href') or $0.getAttributeNS('http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink','href')?
21:25 < superjoe30> ravster, oh wait that's not the one I'm using
21:25 < distilledchaos> woops
21:25 < jarek> oops, wrong channel...
21:25 < superjoe30> ravster, hmm there's some forking weirdness
21:25 < superjoe30> well anyway it's this npm package https://npmjs.org/package/connect-xcors
21:26 < superjoe30> but the repository link given is incorrect
21:28 < distilledchaos> i missed nothing :D
21:29 < distilledchaos> pyrotechnick: you still here?
21:29 < distilledchaos> nope
21:29 < ravster> thanks for the link superjoe30
21:29 < Verdi_> What do people do after the codeschool.com node.js course?
21:29 < superjoe30> Verdi_, think of a small project
21:29 < superjoe30> and then do it
21:30 < distilledchaos> come up with a problem and solve it
21:30 < LEDfan> Hi. I don't understand the meaning of sockets. It is not a variable, but is it a method? I can't find it on Google.
21:30 < Verdi_> superjoe30 thanks
21:30 < distilledchaos> example: implement a blog in node
21:31 < Verdi_> have people found an mvc framework like backbone or ember makes them better at node.js?
21:31 < distilledchaos> LEDfan: socket (from io.sockets.on('connection')) is an object
21:31 < superjoe30> distilledchaos, I'm about to do that for myself actually
21:31 < distilledchaos> the blog idea?
21:31 < superjoe30> yeah
21:31 < distilledchaos> have fun :D
21:31 < superjoe30> I feel like http://andrewkelley.me/ is a bit lacking
21:31 < distilledchaos> just a little
21:32 < distilledchaos> out of curiosity who do you host with?
21:32 < superjoe30> aws
21:32 < LEDfan> distilledchaos: mm tnx. I throught something like that.
21:32 < distilledchaos> np
21:32 < superjoe30> I just yesterday went through and killed my hostmonster account
21:32 < superjoe30> ti's about friggin time
21:32 < distilledchaos> heh
21:32 < distilledchaos> i've been using iWantMyName and i'm rather happy with the result
21:32 < distilledchaos> results*
21:34 < distilledchaos> certainly well-designed
21:34 < superjoe30> distilledchaos, example link?
21:34 < distilledchaos> as in a domain they register?
21:35 < distilledchaos> http://distilledchaos.net/ but it's down right now because i pulled my drone off for use developing bunnybots.jit.su
21:38 < ravster> is there some way to see the list of linked directories that 'npm link' can link to?
21:38 < superjoe30> distilledchaos, you said it's well-designed - are they creating a template for you, or are you talking about the interface with which you register domain names?
21:39 < distilledchaos> the latter
21:39 < superjoe30> ah
21:39 < distilledchaos> but they do provide a lot of services should you desire
21:39 < superjoe30> I see
21:39 < distilledchaos> https://iwantmyname.com/services
21:42 < distilledchaos> Alright, I'm out
21:42 < distilledchaos> it's been fun
22:06 < myndzi> anybody have experience/opinions on https://github.com/fb55/node-htmlparser vs https://github.com/aredridel/html5 ?
22:44 < rudiX> I know most of the people here are awesome programmers .. the thing is I am looking for a job
22:44 < TehShrike1> :-)
22:45 < rudiX> aaaand I tried
22:45 < TehShrike1> I know of some jobs in Lincoln, Nebraska
22:45 < rudiX> I am in Bulgaria :/
22:45 < TehShrike1> aah, well, there you go
22:51 < rudiX> TehShrike: you are freelancer right?
22:51 < TehShrike1> Nope, not yet, still salaried
22:51 < rudiX> tell me more ... at least you can inspire me :)
22:51 < TehShrike|Home> :-)
22:51 < rudiX> what u do for living
22:52 < TehShrike|Home> Got a job during college 5-6 years back, answering phones as the one support guy at a startup
22:52 < TehShrike|Home> Started writing code because nobody stopped me
22:52 < TehShrike|Home> Now I do that for them
22:52 < TehShrike|Home> It's a pretty good gig all told
22:53 < timeturner> TehShrike|Home: where are you located?
22:53 < TehShrike|Home> Lincoln, Nebraska, USA
22:54 < rudiX> good story ... mine was like this - hired (tons of times ago) Nobody stopped me to code better ... Quitted
22:54 < rudiX> started my own projects
22:54 < TehShrike|Home> Hah!
22:54 < niggler> stop looking for jobs
22:54 < niggler> its unhealthy
22:55 < rudiX> 5 years ago ... failed
22:55 < rudiX> :)
22:55 < TehShrike|Home> Yeah, I was quite fortunate to fall in with good programmers
22:56 < rudiX> niggler: your story
22:56 < rudiX> ?
22:56 < rudiX> :)
22:56 <@Nexxy> SomeoneWeird, "this guy" isn't very helpful lol
22:56 < s5fs> Nexxy: hullo
22:57 < niggler> oh i just meant that looking for jobs is unhealthy :)
22:57 <@Nexxy> s5fs, sup!
22:57 < niggler> or working at jobs
22:57 < TehShrike|Home> I do like working, though
22:57 < niggler> i used to work at a hedge fund for a few years
22:57 < s5fs> Nexxy: making felt kitty cat xmas ornaments. you home yet?
22:57 <@Nexxy> I will be by about 11-12 or so
22:57 <@Nexxy> tonight
22:57 < niggler> needless to say its not nearly as fun as playing with javascript
22:57 <@Nexxy> still @ Voxer
22:57 < s5fs> Nexxy: dang! having fun in sf?
22:57 < TehShrike|Home> Is Voxer having a mini-con or something?
22:57 <@Nexxy> success story: I got my fog machine hooked up to node w/o frying anything!!!
22:57 < rudiX> niggler: Yeah ... i didnt go to real job for like 7 years ( i am 32) ... but bills are comming and shit
22:58 <@Nexxy> s5fs, yeah for sure
22:58 <@Nexxy> awesome people everywhere
22:58 <@Nexxy> and voxer's office is amazing
22:58 < s5fs> Nexxy: haha, right on!
22:58 <@Nexxy> AND I got to go to the lego store!
22:58 < s5fs> startup offices in the bay generally are. any slides and/or firemans poles?
22:58 < niggler> Nexxy screw the lego store
22:58 <@Nexxy> s5fs, scooters!
22:58 < s5fs> sutter gutter or gtfo
22:58 < TehShrike|Home> <3 Lego
22:59 < niggler> i used to be a lego proponent
22:59 < s5fs> scooters!
22:59 < niggler> and then i realized how much they've changed
22:59 < s5fs> i got a zappy as a sign-on bonus at one sf startup
22:59 < s5fs> niggler: yeah, in many lego sets there's too many specialized pieces for my liking
23:00 < niggler> s5fs the term you are looking for is POOP
23:00 <@Nexxy> s5fs, niggler no
23:00 < niggler> (piece with only one purpose)
23:00 < TehShrike|Home> The core of Lego will always be awesome blocks that fit together, and those are excellent
23:00 < s5fs> or pewp = pieces everyone won't purchase
23:00 < s5fs> granted, i just made that last one up
23:00 <@Nexxy> s5fs, niggler http://nexxylove.tumblr.com/post/37449265311/so-much-lego-with-dshaw-at-the-lego-store
23:01 <@Nexxy> that
23:01 < niggler> false Nexxy those suck
23:01 < niggler> they are ... for lack of a better word, too simple
23:01 < s5fs> Nexxy: yeah they've got those at the lego store in beavertron too haha
23:01 <@Nexxy> what
23:01 <@Nexxy> really?
23:02 < niggler> if they are going for colors, they should bring back some of the old ones
23:02 < niggler> like the statue of liberty green
23:02 < s5fs> Nexxy: yeah but i'm sure it's not as nice (it's not that large)
23:03 <@Nexxy> this was a fairly small store too
23:03 <@Nexxy> and the only really cool part was the wall
23:03 < niggler> all of the lego stores have the wall
23:03 < s5fs> Nexxy: interesting
23:03 <@Nexxy> it was at uhm
23:03 <@Nexxy> the mall in San Mateo
23:03 < s5fs> Nexxy: back in a few, my dad showed up. gotta change his headlight (damn the elderly)
23:03 <@Nexxy> s5fs, haha
23:03 <@Nexxy> s5fs, good luck!
23:04 < timeturner> I'm going to write a node program that controls my robot to make breakfast every morning
23:04 < TehShrike|Home> What robot?
23:04 < TehShrike|Home> A Mindstorms + Lego one?
23:04 < timeturner> precisely
23:05 < timeturner> then it will open the door for me and drive me to work
23:05 < timeturner> and it'll come to pick me up
23:05 < timeturner> everything automatic
23:06 < TehShrike|Home> Sounds good
23:06 < TehShrike|Home> Lemme know the github project and I'll follow it :-)
23:06 < timeturner> lol
23:06 < matbee_> im making a sexbot
23:06 < matbee_> be afraid
23:06 < TehShrike|Home> ...also using Mindstorm and Lego? 8-|
23:07 < timeturner> then I wake up and realize it was all a dream. A dream set in 2100 :O
23:07 < matbee_> i haven't quite worked out the skin yet-- so be prepared for pokes and prods of wires
23:08 < timeturner> why don't restaurants have robots make all of the food?
23:08 < TehShrike|Home> ...actually
23:08  * TehShrike|Home digs up a link
23:08 < timeturner> like mcdonalds could easily have an entirly automatic setup
23:08 < timeturner> entirely*
23:09 < timeturner> or any other fast food restaurant for that matter
23:09 < timeturner> mainly for ones with tons of customers
23:09 < matbee_> timeturner, it's because people won't buy from it
23:09 < timeturner> why not
23:09 < matbee_> timeturner, they find it weird and inhuman
23:09 < timeturner> lol
23:09 < matbee_> creepy factor, man
23:10 < timeturner> it's probably cleaner than when humans make it
23:10 < matbee_> really?
23:11 < matbee_> so a robot knows when it's infected? :P
23:11 < TehShrike|Home> timeturner: http://motherboard.vice.com/2012/11/21/meet-the-robot-that-makes-360-gourmet-burgers-per-hour
23:12 < TehShrike|Home> This is almost related, but not quite: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBWfBqRDbrM
23:13 < timeturner> LOL
23:13  * TehShrike|Home bows
23:14 < timeturner> lololol, can't stop laughing
23:14 < timeturner> the robot is awesome :D
23:14 < AAA_awright> twice as pricy != twice as good >_>
23:14 < AAA_awright> Quality is ordinal not cardinal
23:16 < AAA_awright> "Yeah, robots are taking our jobs, and it’s not a question of if, but when and how." No, they're not. They're capital that increases the productivity of workers.
23:16 < timeturner> in 150 years there will be robots in places people haven't even dreamed of
23:16 < TehShrike|Home> your butt?
23:16 < TehShrike|Home> No wait, people have dreamed about that
23:16 < AAA_awright> If you're going to speak on behalf of economists, make sure you're actually speaking on behalf of economists
23:16 < AAA_awright> >_>
23:16 < timeturner> butt cleaners, yes
23:17 < timeturner> and all that will be left are the tech companies...
23:17 < timeturner> tech giants
23:24 < zomg> Anyone happen to know of a website tracking tool that sort of lets you see what's happening from the user's POV?
23:24 < zomg> Eg. if a user clicks a button which does an ajax popup, you'd then see the same popup as they did etc.
23:28 < TehShrike|Home> How would you pick the user to follow?
23:29 < zomg> TehShrike|Home: it could work similar to google analytics I guess
23:29 < zomg> Though the tracking would need to be much more sophisticated in order to replay to a degree like that..
