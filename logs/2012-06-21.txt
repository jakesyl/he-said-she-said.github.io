00:00 < EhevuTov> sh1mmer, sounds like something is colliding. Almost like a race-condition or something
00:00 < sh1mmer> Actually, even with some throttling I'm getting a significant amount of bad resolvs
00:00 < bnoordhuis> sh1mmer: does dns.resolve4 work?
00:00 < sh1mmer> bnoordhuis: I'll try that directly
00:01 < EhevuTov> sh1mmer, does your DNS server have a request limit?
00:07 < owen1> othiym23: i tried to insert payload[0].toString('utf-8') but it didn't help
00:08 < Funhouse> ah crap nm it's the second param
00:08 < sh1mmer> bnoordhuis: inconsitently
00:10 < sh1mmer> For example, forbes.com isn't work
00:10 < sh1mmer> I'm going to dig into it a bit and nail down something more specific
00:11 < EhevuTov> sh1mmer, I think I was having similar issues with my program...
00:12 < EhevuTov> sh1mmer, crud, I can't find it, but basically I was doing a missive amount of concurrent lookups against a BIND server and I would get an error like that (not sure if it's the same though)
00:12 < sh1mmer> could be
00:13 < sh1mmer> 5k isn't that many though
00:13 < sh1mmer> especially with a 200ms gap
00:13 < EhevuTov> I was doing domain name checking in a recursive loop for like a,aa,aaa,b,bb,bbb
00:14 < EhevuTov> I don't know where I put that code thought :-(
00:18 < othiym23> owen1: why are you pushing the payload into an array instead of just using a string to accumulate the data streaming in?
00:18 < othiym23> owen1: that code is almost certainly not doing what you want
00:18 < polyrhythmic> is anyone aware of a node translation of the Google Analytics server-side 1x1 gif 'mobile tracking' API?  I can't find one and am going to tackle it.
00:20 < owen1> othiym23: got it. i'll change it. thanks!
00:22 < owen1> othiym23: so use +=
00:22 < owen1> (add to a string)
00:24 < schaf5> when i have the stdin stream in node and feed it from another program, will the 'data' event always be called only once with a buffer which contains the whole message, or may messages produce multiple 'data' events, so that i have to collect input and see when it is finished?
00:25 < othiym23> owen1: yeah, althouth the data coming in will probably be a Buffer, so you'll either need to convert it to a string, or call req.setEncoding('utf-8') first
00:26 < othiym23> owen1: http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_event_data
00:28 < owen1> othiym23:i switch the [] to '' and i already have    req.setEncoding('utf-8');
00:28 < owen1> othiym23: but i get the same issue.
00:28 < owen1> othiym23: and i changed push to +=
00:31 < EhevuTov> sh1mmer, found the code. It's not done, but maybe you could hack it and see if you get similar errors: http://pastebin.com/LQ4pNZxP
00:31 < sh1mmer> thanks
00:35 < othiym23> owen1: ah, you probably need to run JSON.parse() on the data before you pass the payload to the database
00:35 < othiym23> sorry, should have noticed that sooner
00:35 < othiym23> gotta go, bbiab
00:37 < owen1> othiym23: thanks!

00:43 < bnoordhuis> other_guy: yes, that's correct. but it also works like that in v0.6
00:43 < TooTallNate> other_guy: right, it's been like that since 0.6 i believe
00:43 < bnoordhuis> TooTallNate: beat you :)

01:20 < StayInSkool> hey guys, quick question: is there anything like doc() or help() in python to get documentation from the live console? googled about and found nothing
01:22 < Aria> Nope. Javascript doesn't embed docs.

01:30 < Aria> Good call.
01:44 < retrobaby> does anyone here knw enough mongodb?
01:45 < retrobaby> er.. or maybe you can point me to a mongodb dev channel?
01:59 < vrlogrs> hi guys ..
01:59 < vrlogrs> need some help: http://pastebin.com/N4Q6YFpP
01:59 < vrlogrs> can anyone spot the problem in that?
01:59 < vrlogrs> really irratating me ..
02:00 < vrlogrs> im the getting the wtf alert
02:02 < WarheadsSE> vrlogrs: um, are these just snippets?
02:03 < vrlogrs> yah WarheadsSE
02:03 < vrlogrs> i think i figured it out ... 
02:03 < vrlogrs> thanks anyways
02:09 < WarheadsSE> K
02:09 < totallymike> you bet
02:10 < WarheadsSE> I was looking at it like, dafuq, gotta be partial
02:12 <@Nexxy> s5fs, ermahgerd
02:41 < jlank> could someone help me understand why the video stream in this gist gets set to "readable": false ? https://gist.github.com/2963507
02:42 < jlank> how could I store a reference to that stream to pass as a function and keep it readable?
03:03 < guy> Would be nice if anyone could help me with this.
03:03 < guy> https://github.com/anuary/ay-game
03:15 < guy> I am trying to beat the lag when more than one person is moving
03:17 < maedi> guy: hey so is each square a real person playing this game?
03:17 < guy> Yes.
03:17 < maedi> Cool!
03:17 < maedi> Give us a unique 'ID' and we could see each other….
03:18 < guy> You have a unique ID.
03:18 < maedi> So what's that 'backwards' lag thing going on?
03:18 < maedi> oh I just meant visually… they're all white squares, maybe different colors
03:19 < maedi> Be interested to hear the problems you've run into?
03:19 < matt__> node.js exits without any error in my console. is there any way i can find errors in some logging file? (under arch linux arm)
03:20 < guy> maedi: well, it lags when more than one player is moving simultaneously. 
03:25 < maedi> yeah… do you think that's because when 1 client updates, node has to propagate changes to all clients. So if I move first then node updates your screen at a crucial time - when you're also moving, it will put you back to where my client thought you where, so it appears to give a reverse effect?
03:26 < perezd> is defineGetter generally a bad idea?
03:28 < maedi> guy: I would also be curious to see whether a node framework like DerbyJS or Meteor solves this problem. They have some advanced synchronization code
03:29 < Aria> maedi: probably not, because it's application specific. You may need to transmit velocities rather than positions, or do some interpolation.
03:31 < maedi> Aria: so this would make it appear real-time but there would still be millisecond moments when the players are not in sync?
03:32 < Aria> Yes. The trick is probably in ending up 'eventually consistent'
03:32 < Aria> And, in a game, not having any jarring jumps in the mean time.
03:33 < Aria> So if the game thinks you're aiming at 1,5 and you're aiming at 1,4, the display slowly redirects toward the correct values. Anticipation, rather than accuracy.
03:34 < Aria> (this stuff is hard)
03:35 < maedi> yeah….
03:35 < maedi> It's funny how when someone else is moving, my square is the one that jumps. In that case then you could 'block' server updates that target my client, and as you send 'tween' between the server updates for all other objects
03:36 < Aria> Yes!
03:36 < maedi> as you said*
03:46 <@Nexxy> s5fs, ahoy hoy
04:04 < circlicious> npm install express --save , i am having some sha checksum notmatch probs :/
04:16 < sub_stantial> Does anyone have updates on Node.js being used in production ?
04:17 < Margh> is there a dedicated channel for stylus?
04:19 < perezd> sub_stantial: yes, I have an update, its in production.
04:20 < sub_stantial> perezd: which application ?
04:20 < SomeoneWeird> his application?
04:21 < perezd> sub_stantial: nodejs.org
04:21 < perezd> homepage has a large list
04:22 < perezd> http://jobs.nodejs.org/a/jobs/find-jobs
04:22 < perezd> https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Projects,-Applications,-and-Companies-Using-Node
04:22 < perezd> lots of information..
04:23 < sub_stantial> perezd: ahh, thanks a lot! :)
04:23 < perezd> np
04:26 < Margh> anybody know of a way to get stylus middleware to log what it's doing? setting debug doesn't seem to do anything
04:31 < guybrush> Margh open the middleware with your editor and put console.log in it :D
04:31 < guybrush> this is not meant rough or something, it what i would do
04:34 < Margh> yeah i just thought there might be a flag somewhere that says "rendered x.style to /somewhere/here.css'
04:39 < brainproxy> anyone here worked w/ JSON-LD?
04:57 < circlicious> is there a library to which i can pass some html/css/js code and name of a preprocessor like coffee, jade, stylus, less, etc. and it returns me the processed/compiled code?
05:09 < maedi> circlicious: CodeKit?
05:13 < circlicious> maedi: url?
05:13 < circlicious> seems like a mac app, i am more lookin g for a node.js or similar web app that i can host as an API
05:13 < maedi> http://incident57.com/codekit/
05:13 < circlicious> or just use inside my codebase
05:13 < circlicious> nah, not looking for one to use in development
05:14 < maedi> a node framework such as towerjs, derbyjs will do that for you
05:14 < maedi> but you're looking for runtime API?
05:14 < zomg> I wonder if there actually are any existing abstractions for that purpose
05:14 < maedi> lesscss.org does live
05:14 < circlicious> yup, kinda runtime api
05:14 < circlicious> so i pass in code and preprocessor name and it returns the processed code via http
05:15 < maedi> circlicious: yeah that's definitely lesscss
05:15 < circlicious> hm
05:15 < maedi> not sure if there's one for coffeescript, sounds like a good idea though
05:15 < circlicious> :)
05:15 < maedi> - I think - performance probably not too good for files that large / process intensive
05:16 < maedi> guy: How's your game going? Figure out a way to 'block' position updates from the server of your current square?
05:17 < guy> maedi: Just playing with walls at the moment.
05:17 < maedi> I can't seem to move my square anymore
05:17 < guy> I will ping you once it works.
05:17 < guy> : )
05:17 < maedi> thanks
05:20 < php10> does mongoose model.save() contain the saved document? i need to get the _id of the saved document
05:20 < circlicious> hey
05:20 < circlicious> you guys making games ? :D
05:20 < circlicious> i wanna make games too
05:20 < maedi> yes, nodes is awesome for games
05:21 < maedi> I have a feeling nodejs game frameworks will start popping up if they haven't already....
05:27 < circlicious> any recommended node markdown parser?
05:30 < Delapouite> github-flavored-markdown
05:35 < circlicious> um
05:38 < shama> circlicious: yamyam -> http://search.npmjs.org/#/YamYam
05:56 < SomeoneWeird> is it possible to force npm to install to ./node_modules?
05:56 < abonstu> hey, so im trying to do something i thought would be pretty straight forward: pass data between two connected sockets, but i seem to be failing - data only seems to work in one direction.
05:56 < abonstu> http://pastebin.com/0ks21znL
05:57 <@Nexxy> SomeoneWeird, that's what it does
05:57 < abonstu> i.e. telnet client on port 8124 can pass data to telnet client on 8125 - but not the reverse.. what am i missing here?
05:57 < SomeoneWeird> Nexxy, i have node_modules folders in levels above ./ which it will default to
05:58 <@Nexxy> wat
05:59 < SomeoneWeird> http://pastie.org/private/r5vjswuxg5ynxujzyjpkaq
06:00 < blakmatrix>  SomeoneWeird what are you making that directory ?
06:00 < SomeoneWeird> ?
06:01 < blakmatrix> was npm not making it on its own?
06:02 < SomeoneWeird> no, im showing Nexxy how folders in directories above . take precedence over ./node_modules if its not created
06:03 <@Nexxy> still confused
06:03 < Margh> well yeah you can just make one to force it to put the modules there
06:03 <@Nexxy> ohhh
06:03 < Margh> but if it doesn't find one it traverses up trying to find the project root
06:03 <@Nexxy> ok I see what you're saying
06:03 < blakmatrix> might throw the -dd  or -ddd flag on npm and try it again
06:04 < SomeoneWeird> yerp
06:04 < SomeoneWeird> hm
06:04 <@Nexxy> my first question is why? lol
06:04 < Margh> i think if you don't make an empty one in your root it gives up and puts it in ./ ?
06:04 < Margh> just gonna check
06:04 < SomeoneWeird> just so i can keep modules compartmentalized 
06:05 < SomeoneWeird> probably just a habit
06:05 <@Nexxy> they already are
06:05 <@Nexxy> they each get their own directory
06:05 <@Nexxy> with their own package.json
06:05 < SomeoneWeird> i know, i mean
06:05 <@Nexxy> and their own node_modules/
06:05 < SomeoneWeird> not always
06:06 <@Nexxy> well no, not if they have no dependencies
06:06 <@Nexxy> but you get the idea ;P
06:06 < SomeoneWeird> yar
06:06 < Margh> so you want a node_modules folder that's more specific the further down you get into your app?
06:06 <@Nexxy> node_modules_with_mascots
06:06 <@Nexxy> node_modules_with_silly_names
06:07 < SomeoneWeird> lol, dw i think i can figure this out
06:07 <@Nexxy> just make yourself some modules that do nothing but require other modules and export them all
06:07 <@Nexxy> then you can assemble a giant monstrosity of module paths to satisfy your need for useless organization ;P
06:08 < SomeoneWeird> :P
06:16 < Margh> for real: wtf, i give stylus a src that's one level down, and give it an absolute dest in a static serve, and everything 404s
06:16 < circlicious> that guy probably left\
06:17 < circlicious> the one who linked, http://search.npmjs.org/#/YamYam
06:17 < circlicious> wheres the docs ? :/
06:17 < blakmatrix> https://github.com/sokra/YamYam/blob/master/README.md ?
06:19 < circlicious> blakmatrix: lol, was the link there?
06:20 < circlicious> simple kind of markdown compiler , hmm.. feels as if its not fully featured :P
06:20 < circlicious> guess i'll use node-markdown
06:21 < circlicious> https://github.com/andris9/node-markdown
06:42 < guy> maedi: http://dev.anuary.com/1f1715ac-ad96-536a-a462-74381c7a2baf/
06:43 < maedi> guy: thanks. I don't think I can move though
06:43 < guy> Did you refresh the page..?
06:44 < maedi> oh that's better, used Firefox, Chrome's so good at caching
06:45 < maedi> Great stuff, once you fix the 'reverse' bug it's ready for the masses :)
06:46 < maedi> Do you think it will be easy to 'block' updates for your current square?
07:00 < guy> http://dev.anuary.com/1f1715ac-ad96-536a-a462-74381c7a2baf/

07:19 < zutto> someone give me some kind of hint what i should be looking for when i want to start process from node w/o parent having any kind of control over it :|? child_process seems to be out of question
07:20 < maedi> guy: hey you did it! How?
07:21 < Codedninja> lol
07:21 < guy> It is all on git. Basically it allows for more errors.
07:21 < maedi> okay I'll have a read, so the fix you've come up with is error prone?
07:22 < guy> The fast moving figures are bots, if you are wondering. http://dev.anuary.com/1f1715ac-ad96-536a-a462-74381c7a2baf/
07:22 < Codedninja> guy it's nice idea. Why not make a random color picker for each player
07:22 < guy> sorry, wrong link http://dev.anuary.com/1f1715ac-ad96-536a-a462-74381c7a2baf/?bot=1
07:23 < guy> Codedninja: I've started playing with it only yesterday. Will add it later on. I am planing to add gravitation first.
07:23 < Codedninja> Ah okay. It is nice
07:24 < guy> It is a big of a challenge for the first Node.js/Socket.io project. Though, I don't really understand what's so special about it for now.. just basic JS.
07:25 < Codedninja> Anyone know a good way to do heatmaps? and not use heatmaps.js
07:27 < SubStack> Codedninja: what sort of heatmaps?
07:27 < SubStack> https://github.com/substack/node-heatmap
07:28 < Codedninja> Friend making a home automation system with embed electronics and he wants to make map to show temperature levels and power usage.
07:28 < dr0id> so I am actually thinking of writing a quick node library that can take in html/css/js preprocessor code and spill out the processed code. thoughts ? :P
07:33 < [AD]Turbo> hi there
07:33 < dr0id> where?
07:38 < owen1> https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/nodejs/WrkuKEco1O0   i am confused. what does functional means? functional OO style (using new keyword) or functinal programming style?
07:39 < ljharb> functional usually means *don't* use the "new" keyword
07:39 < guy> ha
07:39 < ljharb> being that "new" is more object oriented, not function oriented.
07:40 < owen1> ljharb: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1557386/prototypal-vs-functional-oop-in-javascript  but here they say functional == traditional OOP
07:40 < ljharb> that's totally wrong
07:40 < ljharb> "traditional" OOP means classical inheritance, which does not apply AT ALL to javascript
07:41 < ljharb> "functional" means more like a functional language, ie scheme or haskell or lisp or something
07:41 < owen1> ok
07:41 < ljharb> as far as im aware, it means using functions as verbs, and passing around data, instead of using objects as nouns
07:41 < owen1> is prototypal inheritance = functional?
07:41 < ljharb> see http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html
07:41 < ljharb> no
07:41 < ljharb> they're 3 distinct patterns
07:42 < owen1> so prototypal means i use extend and extending an object literal, right?
07:42 <@Nexxy> prototypal inheritance is the argyle to OO's houndstooth
07:42 <@Nexxy> or vice versa
07:42 < owen1> Nexxy: sorry. didn't get it (:
07:42 <@Nexxy> well maybe if you had some class ;P
07:43 <@Nexxy> they are both patterns!
07:43 < huamma> Hi all
07:44 < ^3rdEden> :( stupid IRC blocked my nickname
07:44 <@Nexxy> ^3rdEden, that was me
07:45 < ^3rdEden> that's not nice :(
07:45 < ^3rdEden> And also my IRC client stopped working -_-, it's turning in to a horrible day
07:45 <@Nexxy> I never claimed to be :D
07:46 < ^3rdEden> Nexxy: I just made that assumption, I guess i was wrong, ;o
07:46 <@Nexxy> ._.
07:46 <@Nexxy> I... I'm sorry.
07:46 < owen1> ljharb: so i can use functional style regardless of the prototypal or classical patterns?
07:47 <@Nexxy> ^3rdEden, please forgive me
07:47 < ^3rdEden> Now i'm forced to learn irssi =/
07:47 <@Nexxy> I tried to auto-complete your nickname with `<tab> for what it's worth
07:47 < ^3rdEden> Nexxy: \o/
07:47 < owen1> ^3rdEden: try weechat. it's irssi but better
07:47 < zutto> someone give me some kind of hint what i should be looking for when i want to start process from node w/o parent having any kind of control over it :|? child_process seems to be out of question
07:47 <@Nexxy> owen1, define 'better'
07:47 < ljharb> owen1: functional, prototypal, and classical are usually mutually exclusive.
07:48 <@Nexxy> zutto, .exec?
07:48 < owen1> Nexxy: easier to use. better defaults
07:48 < zutto> Nexxy: nope
07:48 < ^3rdEden> owen1: Will check it out, thanks
07:48 < zutto> owen1: dont forget that it supports many more languages as plugins than irssi
07:48 < ljharb> and this is javascript. please don't use the word "class". javascript doesn't have classes.
07:48 <@Nexxy> zutto, why not?
07:48 < zutto> Nexxy: the process starts, but it wont do anything until node process has closed :|
07:49 < zutto> (in short: i'm trying to start process that has a GUI)
07:49 <@Nexxy> zutto, O_o
07:49 < zutto> coding "media center" to my RPI w/node.. atleast trying to
07:49 < justinfr> class class class
07:49 < owen1> ljharb: ok. so when i look at js program. i can identify if it's functional OR prototypal or 'classicl'.
07:50 < zutto> but seems like big no-go when i cant start the video player :|
07:50 <@Nexxy> zutto, you most certainly can
07:50 < ljharb> owen1: it can never be classical, because javascript does not have classes. it can only desperately attempt to be classical.
07:50 < dr0id> what's wrong here - http://pastie.org/private/ijotieiml2s5hz4aywq1sq - why the errors ?
07:50 < owen1> ljharb: by classical, i think i mean - using the new keyword to create instance of objects
07:51 < ljharb> owen1: then you're wrong, because "new" can mean either classical or prototypal inheritance patterns.
07:51 < zutto> i just cant figure out what i am doing wrong >_<, ive been playing around with child_process functions for 4 hours now, and googling.. alot, the video player only after node has been stopped/killed 
07:51 < owen1> ljharb: oh
07:55 < Naeblis> I'm new to node.js/express.js and I want to parse JSON data from a website. Any good tutorials?
07:56 < ljharb> you can parse JSON data with JSON.parse(somejsonstring)
07:57 < huamma> How can I convice my working partners javascript is a good programming language? I tried everything but they still say javascript sucks, ergo Node.js sucks too! D:
07:57 < dr0id> ofcourse, they are right.
07:57 < zutto> huamma: benchmarks, go!
07:57 < choo> q
07:57 < ljharb> huamma: point at the job market?
07:58 < dominictarr> huamma, what do they like?
07:58 < dr0id> PHP
07:58 < ljharb> haha
07:58 < huamma> Yep. PHP+mySQL
07:58 < ljharb> i bet they put javascript inline in their php too
07:58 < dominictarr> then they don't like learning new things
07:58 < ljharb> … philistines
07:59 < huamma> Yes. I think so, but I'm crazy because I like to put js code on server side u_u
07:59 < ljharb> that is absolutely disgusting
07:59 < dr0id> don't do it just because these guys have made it a hipe
07:59 < dr0id> *hype
07:59 < ljharb> javascript should never be anywhere but in .js files
08:00 < dominictarr> someone should write a php -> js compiler so these people can run php on the client.
08:00 < huamma> Hahaha
08:01 < zutto> i'm having a feeling that it wouldnt really work as intended
08:02 < dominictarr> no, and anyone who knew enough js to do it would surely be taking the piss
08:02 < dr0id> ok now who can help me with this - http://pastie.org/private/ijotieiml2s5hz4aywq1sq ?
08:02 <@Nexxy> honestly if it were me I'd let you keep all of it
08:04 < dominictarr> huamma, from my experience, its usually best to just do it your own way when no one is looking.
08:04 < dr0id> Nexxy: you are an OP, so you should definitely help me out :P
08:04 < dominictarr> once a new tool is working then people can't really complain
08:05 < dominictarr> you just need a small secret project suited to node
08:05 < dominictarr> -- it's easier to get forgiveness than permission --
08:05 <@Nexxy> dr0id, I'm an OP, yes... I don't use jade, sorry
08:05 <@Nexxy> I would have gladly offered help if I knew what to tell you :)
08:05 < huamma> I was thinking about doing something like that
08:06 < huamma> Maybe at home and, when I'll have something working, show it to my collegues
08:07 < dominictarr> or, boss is on holiday works great.
08:07 < dr0id> heh
08:07 < dr0id> Nexxy: ok
08:07 < huamma> Hehehe ;)
08:09 < dominictarr> dr0id, your code looks fine to me
08:09 < NodeX> [08:58:18] <huamma> Yep. PHP+mySQL 
08:09 < NodeX> *shudder*
08:09 < NodeX> The MYSQL part at least
08:09 < dr0id> well
08:10 < dr0id> dominictarr: then why the error ?
08:10 < niloy> how to define private functions in javascript?
08:10 < dr0id> Nexxy: dominictarr: what do you have to say about this - http://pastie.org/private/aoqhgq6wd9tgmlt5jz7iiq ?
08:11 < dr0id> the "-e" in stdout especially
08:11 < NodeX> niloy : anonymous functions are by design private
08:11 < niloy> I cant call anonymous functions
08:11 < dominictarr> take out -e and it works
08:12 < NodeX> I dont think javascript has the scope for them iirc
08:12 < NodeX> unless it's a new thing
08:12 < NodeX> most people get round it with object notation to protect inside the namespace
08:13 < NodeX> var foo = { init : function(){...} }; .... foo.init();
08:13 < dr0id> dominictarr: um, yeah I know. but I don't wanna take out -e to make sure the command respects, newlines, etc.
08:13 < dominictarr> it's because exec actually calls sh -c 'echo -e "h1 hello" | jade'
08:14 < dominictarr> I don't know why -e is the problem
08:14 < dr0id> och
08:14 < dr0id> dam kk, heh
08:14 < dr0id> thanks :)
08:14 < dominictarr> what you could do, is just go cp = spawn ('jade')
08:15 < dominictarr> and then pipe your jade into cp.stdin
08:15 < dominictarr> or do cp.stdin.end('h1 hello')
08:15 < dominictarr> that should work.
08:22 < Naeblis> if I have the JSON in another route, like example.com/me, how can I fetch that json from there?
08:23 < Naeblis> In express.js
08:24 < sx20201> How can I renew a sessionid cookie?
08:25 < radiodario> Naeblis: you can do an http request?
08:25 < Naeblis> using app.get()?
08:26 <@Nexxy> Naeblis, use the data represented by the JSON directly
08:26 <@Nexxy> if you're trying to access it from within the app
08:26 < huamma> I think so. If you want only json, you can use a send() instead of render() to send plain JSON
08:27 < huamma> Am I wrong? ._.
08:27 < radiodario> http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/http.html#http_http_request_options_callback
08:27 < radiodario> if you want to grab something via http, that's what you need
08:28 < radiodario> app.get is to *answer* get requests from the users
08:28 < Naeblis_> ok.
08:28 < radiodario> i.e. app.get('/home', routes.homepage);
08:28 < radiodario> etc
08:28 < Naeblis_> and if I have the file running on the same location as the JSON, how will I get the data then?
08:28 < radiodario> running?
08:29 < radiodario> you mean a static file ?
08:29 < Naeblis_> brb
08:34 < huangjs> i'm using connect 2.3.3, how can i define dispatches on method and path?
08:34 < huangjs> it seems I can 't use connect.router method
08:36 < NodeX> 42
08:37 < radiodario> but what was the question?
08:37  * radiodario builds a huge computer to find it
08:39 < huangjs> any recommendation to middleware to allow me define dispatch in connect?
08:42 < stagas> SubStack: new dnode looks awesome!
08:45 < madsdk> Hi guys. Have any of you worked with the xbox DropBox module? I'm having some problems with uploading binary data to DropBox through it. 
08:45 < madsdk> xbox = dbox :)
08:48 < zutto> Nexxy: apparently you were right :|
08:49 < zutto> its all cause of i have fifo sock on the cmd >_<
08:51 < circlicious> require() is not async?
09:07 < simonadameit> will node die if an uncaught exception is generated?
09:07 < simonadameit> if not, how can i get it to die if an uncaught exception occurs?
09:07 < radiodario> yeah it crashes yes
09:07 < simonadameit> thats good!
09:07 < radiodario> it does doesn't it? 
09:07  * radiodario looks at everyone in the channel
09:07 < simonadameit> i saw the 'uncaughtException' handler, so i was unsure about that
09:08 < radiodario> hmm
09:08 < radiodario> now i'm cnfused
09:12 < simonadameit> radiodario: now the docs says that if this handler is installed the exit will not occur
09:12 < simonadameit> i suppose it would be bad practice for any module to install this handler?
09:18 < augustl> anyone here using postgres for an app and have a setup that cleans the DB in between automated tests?
09:30 < radiodario> yep
09:31 < radiodario> altough you could handle it by making it send you a text message screaming HEY DUDE AN UNCAUGHT EXCEPTION!
09:32 < circlicious> i am trying to pass a block fo text through jade via command line, but it throws error and doesn't work, any idea why? - http://pastie.org/4125410
09:38 < radiodario> circlicious: quotes
09:38 < radiodario> use single quotes around 'en'
09:39 < radiodario> you don't really have to specify en enyways
09:40 < circlicious> radiodario: it is user submitted
09:40 < circlicious> if i use single quptes, th error does not stop
09:40 < circlicious> um
09:41 < Node> process.stdin.on('keypress')
09:42 < Node> WHOIS
09:44 < circlicious> radiodario: you are right, single quotes. but it is user submitted. how can i take care of it ? :/ i guess escaping double quotes should fix it then ?
09:44 < circlicious> how can i escape double quotes in node ?
09:44 < radiodario> well
09:45 < NodeX> \"
09:45 < NodeX> same as every other language
09:45 < radiodario> like japanese
09:45 < radiodario> but you're having your users submit jade?
09:45 < radiodario> i can only wonder what you're making
09:45 < radiodario> mind control machine
09:45 < circlicious> NodeX: i mean what function in node to do that?
09:46 < circlicious> radiodario: well, yes, its an interesting thing
09:47 < radiodario> ok why don't you surraound your whole string with single quotes?
09:47 < radiodario> insteado of using single quotes around en?
09:47 < circlicious> um, then i will need t escape single quotes ?
09:47 < NodeX> function escapeStr(str) { return str.replace(str,'\'+str); }
09:47 < circlicious> and i guess in bash its best to quote with double quotes
09:47 < circlicious> NodeX: ok
09:47 < NodeX> or something of that nature
09:48 < upb> haha
09:49 < radiodario> who's this node guy?
09:50 < NodeX> function escapeStr(e,str) { return e.replace(str,'\'+str); } //
09:50 < upb> why not str.replace(str, str)
09:50 < NodeX> who's this radiodario guy ?
09:50 < upb> if you escape something, you need to escape the escape sequence aswell
09:50 < upb> if it appears in input
09:51 < NodeX> he is asking how to addslashes
09:51 < NodeX> ^^ function to addslashes
09:51 < upb> what is addslashes?
09:51 < NodeX> exactly
09:51 < NodeX> what is anything really
09:51 < upb> o_O
09:52 < upb> your escapeStr(input, "'") would replace ' with \'
09:52 < upb> but leave \ itself the same, which is incorrect
09:52 < NodeX> it's not down to the function to check if the input is a backslash
09:53 < circlicious> well
09:53 < circlicious> it replaces only once, i never knew that :P
09:53 < circlicious> so i guess i have to use a regexp in str.replace
09:53 < circlicious> with g
09:53 < NodeX> is it multiple lines?
09:54 < circlicious> "en" is single line
09:54 < NodeX> you might be better with http://phpjs.org/functions/addslashes:303
09:54 < NodeX> "Escapes single quote, double quotes and backslash characters in a string with backslashes"
09:55 < circlicious> everything seems to work gr8 now
09:55 < circlicious> NodeX: i just wwant to escape double quotes , its a bash command "$CMD"
09:55 < circlicious> "{Jade_code}"
09:56 < circlicious> rather
09:56 < circlicious> :)
09:56 < circlicious> getting me ? :P
09:58 < NodeX> Nope :P
09:58 < circlicious> $ echo "html(lang=\"en\") re'st i's coo'ol"
09:59 < NodeX> don't start the rest debate again
09:59 < NodeX> it's as bad as the PC / MAC debate and the PHP vs The worl debate
09:59 < NodeX> world *
09:59 < circlicious> NodeX: ?
10:00 < NodeX> There seems to be an underlying theme to this chan which is a debate about how Good / Bad REST is
10:00 < circlicious> meh
10:01 < circlicious> i like you btw, you seem to be one of those funny guys in IRC, radiodario  too
10:01 < circlicious> its because of you guys channels are persisting
10:01 < circlicious> else the world would be too boring
10:01 < tonyk> I have an equally pointless debate for you
10:02 < stagas> amiga rulez
10:02 < tonyk> BLONDES OR BRUNETTES?
10:02 < tonyk> hello stagas!
10:02 < php10> tits or ass
10:02 < stagas> tonyk: hey!
10:02 < radiodario> nodex not you, Node 
10:02 < tonyk> php10: definitely not pointless
10:03 < php10> tony: only one of them are
10:03 < NodeX> legs or breasts
10:03 < NodeX> (KFC of course)
10:03 < php10> arms or ears
10:04  * php10 going to sleep now
10:04 < upb>  < NodeX> it's not down to the function to check if the input is a backslash
10:04 < upb> interesting
10:05 < upb> care to explain why this 'PHP addslashes' is escaping \ then?
10:05 < dr0id> its raining
10:05 < NodeX> upb : are you serious ?
10:06 < upb> sure
10:06 < NodeX> ok lol, firstly double quotes in json need escaping
10:06 < php10> upb: a backslash is an escape character in mysql queries
10:07 < NodeX> single quotes in SQL need escaping else can lead to injection
10:07 < php10> upb: http://php.net/manual/en/function.addslashes.php
10:07 < upb> da fuq are you on about now?
10:07 < upb> you seemed to claim that the escape sequence itself does not need escaping
10:07 < NodeX> dude are you for real
10:07  * php10 sigh
10:08 < tonyk> maximum trolling
10:08 < NodeX> it must be troll-oclock
10:08 < upb> < NodeX> it's not down to the function to check if the input is a backslash
10:08 < NodeX> it isn't 
10:08 < upb> but it is :)
10:08 < NodeX> how is it
10:08 < upb> because if he just escapes " to \"
10:08 < upb> and not \
10:09 < NodeX> that makes no sense
10:09 < upb> you can break out of the context of a parameter by having \"
10:09 < upb> which will turn into \\" by your function
10:09 < NodeX> again it's not down to THAT funciton to scan for a slash
10:09 < NodeX> if it's aready escaped why would it be put through THAT funciton ?
10:10 < upb> because it isnt already escaped
10:10 < NodeX> ok lol
10:10 < NodeX> cool story ;)
10:10 < upb> haha
10:10 < upb> why would you feed an already escaped string to escapeStr
10:10 < NodeX> I wouldnt
10:10 < NodeX> and I just said that
10:10 < upb> so it's not already escaped
10:10 < NodeX> how so ?
10:11 < upb> just happens to contain \\"
10:11 < NodeX> false
10:11 < upb> erm, just \"
10:11 < NodeX> !==true
10:12 < NodeX> deefing the string \\" to that function would make it \\\" which re-esacapes it
10:12 < NodeX> defin -> feeding
10:12 < upb> yeah and thats the wrong kind of behaviour
10:13 < NodeX> false
10:13 < circlicious> lol, you guys are still fighting
10:13 < circlicious> replace(/"/g, "\\\"") - just do this
10:13 < NodeX> I aint fighting, I am trolling hard
10:13 < circlicious> ;D
10:13 < circlicious> u ro
10:13 < circlicious> x
10:13 < upb> you are only trolling yourself :)
10:13 < NodeX> I am not trolling myself... you're still trying to convince me something
10:14 < circlicious> i am just wondering whether i should use jquery here or write the ajax code in plain JS heh
10:14 < tonyk> if this is for sql then why not use the vendor functions?
10:14 < tonyk> or if your db is decent enough (postgres) use query_params
10:14 < circlicious> mysql is not decent ?
10:14 < upb> consider you have invokeShellCommandWithParam(userinput) { shell('head "-' + escape(userinput) + '"'); }
10:15 < upb> if you just replace " with \" in userinput, it is not sufficient
10:15 < circlicious> upb: really ? :S
10:15 < upb> yup
10:15 < circlicious> what more should be done then
10:15 < NodeX> it is sufficient
10:15 < tonyk> circlicious: did I pinch a nerve there?
10:15 < NodeX> true story
10:16 < circlicious> tonyk: :P
10:16 < upb> consider that userinput could be \";owned;
10:16 < upb> it would invoke shell('head "-\\";owned;')
10:16 < circlicious> no
10:16 < upb> yup
10:16 < circlicious> the command is getting executed with "" not ''
10:16 < tonyk> meaningless discussion, YOU SHOULDNT USE YOUR OWN ESCAPING FUNCTION
10:17 < tonyk> use connection.escape() for mysql, problem solved
10:17 < upb> true, if you dont know wtf youre doing like node-x
10:17 < circlicious> tonyk: its for bash
10:17 < NodeX> it's nodex not node-x
10:17 < circlicious> upb: ok, am i wrong ? 
10:17 < NodeX> kthnxbai
10:17 < upb> circlicious: yes
10:17 < NodeX> upb lol I wouldn't even dream of doing it the way I suggested
10:18 < NodeX> someone asked how to do it in JS and I explained
10:18 < circlicious> upb: i am no sure i get you
10:18 < tonyk> circlicious: oh
10:19 < upb> heh my point is that if you have some parameter enclosed in "
10:19 < upb> the escape sequence is \
10:19 < NodeX> he is saying that you need to escape a bit better if you're after more than just escaping a double quote
10:19 < circlicious> exec("head "-\\";owned;")
10:19 < circlicious> that will break
10:19 < upb> then you need to escape the enclosing character " aswell as \ itself
10:19 < circlicious> oh ye
10:20 < circlicious> hm
10:21 < funktronic> anyone know of something like perfomance counters for node?
10:21 < tonyk> in that case I'd do a whitelist
10:21 < radiodario> funktronic: you have an awesome nick
10:21 < tonyk> only allow a-z, A-Z, 0-9
10:21 < tonyk> yeah im paranoid
10:22 < NodeX> tonyk : what about hex/ascii codes - they're made of those chars ?
10:22 < upb> yeah thats the most foolproof way not to shoot yourself in the foot:)
10:22 < tonyk> NodeX you shouldn't be sending that over the shell anyway
10:22 < NodeX> why even have somehting exposed to the internet be able to execute commands in the first place
10:23 < funktronic> radiodario: it does bring all the boys to the yard
10:23 < funktronic> but srsly, anything like perfomance counters/another way to monitor real time what's going on?
10:23 < radiodario> hmm
10:23 < mmalecki> funktronic: dtrace
10:23 < radiodario> yeah dtrace works
10:24 < radiodario> also you can join it up with cubism http://bost.ocks.org/mike/cubism/intro/
10:24 < funktronic> not enough context and slows things down iirc
10:24 < circlicious> maybe radiodario was right, i should use single quotes and escape single quotes inside. what do you think upb ?
10:25 < funktronic> node-monitor looks interesting though
10:25 < tonyk> circlicious: whats the intended purpose of you calling exec?
10:25 < upb> circlicious: yes
10:25 < upb> then you dont need to worry about $ etc
10:25 < circlicious> yah :3
10:25 < tonyk> *shell even
10:26 < circlicious> tonyk: i want ythe user to be able to convert Jade code and see the processed HTMl in realtime
10:26 < circlicious> and Haml(Ruby thingie)
10:26 < circlicious> so i am using binaries of both
10:26 < guy> What should I do next? http://dev.anuary.com/1f1715ac-ad96-536a-a462-74381c7a2baf/
10:26 < tonyk> you can use a ramfs, write it into a file and use std input
10:26 < tonyk> save you a lot of trouble
10:27 < circlicious> i could write to file, but i guess thats extra work and not sure how would that perform with lots of people using the app
10:28 < funktronic> the answer was also https://github.com/felixge/node-measured
10:29 < tonyk> circlicious: im sure the cost of parsing the code will be way way more than the cost of writing to a ramfs device
10:30 < c3l> ive been googling but not finding; does anyone know of a markdown parser that parses "metadata", like multimarkdown? However the multimarkdown package return a fully formatted html document if you give it metadata. I only want snippets, and I want the metadata returned as json object or similar.
10:31 < tonyk> also isnt here a character limit on shell arguments on some OS'es?
10:31 < jhsto> Can anyone recommend me a good module to extract data from server-side functions to client-side DOM?
10:31 < c3l> wow, just like this but for node http://freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/Meta-Data
10:32 < tonyk> I remember a 32k char limit test on some configure scripts
10:34 < circlicious> tonyk: hmm
10:35 < tonyk> found it
10:35 < tonyk> $ getconf ARG_MAX
10:35 < upb> yup
10:35 < tonyk> 2mb on my system
10:36 < upb> you dont even need to write it to some temp file if you could pipe it in to the process
10:36 < upb> pretty sure you can make a pipe and tie the stdin to it in node somhow :)
10:37 < tonyk> yeah if you can do that
10:39 < tonyk> upb: you're right, this code might be relevant http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/child_process.html
10:39 < tonyk> "A very elaborate way to run 'ps ax | grep ssh'"

10:45 < circlicious> tonyk: theres a lot of code there, which one exactly ? :D
10:46 < tonyk> circlicious: "A very elaborate way to run 'ps ax | grep ssh'"
10:46 < szikael> my x-www-form-urlencode  looks like "  sessid : 12312    sessname: 34242 " now i want this number to my variables   
10:48 < circlicious> tonyk: so i do spawn('echo'', [my_string]) and dont have to worry about escaping ?
10:49 < circlicious> and stdout.on('data' ... pass to jade's stdin.write?
10:49 < tonyk> no, you do jade.stdin.write(my_string);
10:50 < circlicious> oh
10:50 < tonyk> maybe add a "\n" in the end
10:50 < circlicious> and i dont have to worry about escaping ? why';s that?
10:50 < circlicious> what difference does it make ? i am curious, please englithend me :P)
10:50 < circlicious> :)*
10:50 < circlicious> sorry for the typos :/
10:51 < tonyk> because it bypasses the shell, try it yourself and see if you can inject stuff into it
10:51 < circlicious> oh
10:51 < circlicious> i am gonna play with it, wait
10:53 < tonyk> you also have to send an eof with jade.stdin.end()
11:10 < circlicious> tonyk: werid, its making me download file :S
11:10 < staar2> hello
11:13 < circlicious> had to set content type of res.send
11:13 < circlicious> tonyk: working great man :D

12:15 < guy> : )
12:16 < stride> cute :)
12:17 < guy> haha. my girlfriend is jealous that you "hopped" me
12:17 < dr0id> guy: how much time did it take ot build that?
12:19 < guy> dr0id: an hour to read and understand docs for Socket.io, 3 hours to learn everything about Canvas in MDN, and ~8 hours playing around with the code.
12:19 < dr0id> ok
12:19 < dr0id> that means once its done, I could smash out simple similar games every 2 days nice
12:19 < dr0id> then blog , place ads, generate revenue, cool
12:19 < guy> : )
12:20 < dr0id> guy: MDN was nuff to learn abou canvas?
12:20 < guy> Well, that's all there is?
12:20 < dr0id> well, I don't know but maybe we could collab on a blog lol
12:21 < guy> dr0id: are you trolling?
12:21 < dr0id> I usually don't
12:23 < guy> I wouldn't have time for that. I do this mostly for learning reasons. Feel free to use the code, though.

13:12 < augustl> are there any API docs for http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/ ?
13:12 < tonyk> circlicious: I am now
13:13 < tonyk> augustl: I dunno, but the source is very heavily commented
13:13 < tonyk> in a good way
13:15 < augustl> looking to create multiple sets of middlewares and combine them. The "api" middleware that consists of a number of other middlewares, the "status" middleware that also consists of multiple other midldewares, etc, and put them all together as one middleware
13:16 < circlicious> tonyk: i was just owndering whether node does esacping/quoting behind the scenes?
13:16 < circlicious> or is it not required at all since we bypass the shell
13:16 < augustl> seems there's no stand-alone middleware builder
13:17 < tonyk> circlicious: no it doesn't, it just sends the data through standard input
13:18 < circlicious> tonyk: what if i pass the data as an argument instead of writing to stdin?
13:19 < augustl> anyone know if there's a way to turn a collection of middlewares to one middleware with connect?
13:20 < AAA_awright> circlicious: It depends on what you're calling. exec() calls a shell, fork/spawn/etc opens the new process directly
13:21 < circlicious> AAA_awright: what i am confused about is, when i use spawn to open new process directly, then does the arguments that i pass, say a string, does that get quoted/escaped ?
13:22 < AAA_awright> circlicious: child_process.spawn() calls the new process directly, the arguments you pass to it are literally what is going to be that process' argv and argc
13:23 < augustl> nvm, turns out connect can take other connect apps
13:23 < AAA_awright> circlicious: When you start a new program on a shell it has to parse the line of text into an executable to open and a vector (Array) of arguments to open it with
13:24 < AAA_awright> Opening the process directly bypasses that
13:26 < circlicious> AAA_awright: when the process is opened directly via say .spawn() are the arguments passed as a vector array ?
13:26 < circlicious> whcih is what the shell forms by parsing the entire command line
13:29 < AAA_awright> circlicious: Yeah, any of the functions that accepts an "arg" parameter
13:31 < AAA_awright> What you pass as args is what Node.js would read almost exactly, maybe unless there's a NUL character somewhere in the stream, and Node.js prepends the program name to the arguments list for you
13:31 < circlicious> hm, i think i get it now, so its passed as an array and not a string that has to be broken into an array. thats why it need not be escaped/quoted. thanks :)
13:31 < AAA_awright> circlicious: Are you familiar with basic command line programs in C, and reading argv?
13:32 < circlicious> AAA_awright: unfortunately no :(
13:32 < circlicious> but i know little about reading argx
13:32 < circlicious> argv*
13:33 < circlicious> it contains the array of arguments passed to the script
13:33 < AAA_awright> The first one is the name of the program, how it was called, e.g. "node" or "/usr/local/bin/node"
13:33 < circlicious> argc contains the num of arguments
13:34 < circlicious> yup ,the rest are options passed
13:35 < circlicious> AAA_awright: actually what we started at was, i was executing a command via exec that had user input string. so i was worried about security. while it seems like the problem is solved with spawn as i dont need to worry about quoting/escaping the user string. and i was just curious about why? :)
13:35 < AAA_awright> circlicious: the exec() command is a shortcut to opening a shell and passing it a single parameter, the shell in turns evaluates the string you passed it, breaks it up into arguments, and passes those arguments to a new child process. It has a bit more overhead, so is discouraged
13:35 < circlicious> got it! :)
13:35 < AAA_awright> circlicious: Yeah, also look at the execFile command which appears to have a similar interface but bypasses shell
13:36 < circlicious> ok!
13:36 < qbit_> if anyone else here is running openbsd: http://deftly.net/node-dev.tgz 0.7.12 port files 
13:38 < bnoordhuis> qbit_: how well does libuv work on openbsd?
13:39 < bnoordhuis> we have a guy that occasionally submits openbsd fixes but i don't test it myself
13:39 < qbit_> bnoordhuis: pretty well 
13:39  * qbit_ has submitted one for openbsd
13:39 < qbit_> made "make test" work :P 
13:39 < bnoordhuis> qbit_: what does `make test` look like?
13:39 < bnoordhuis> ah right :)
13:39 < qbit_> it still dies part way
13:40 < qbit_> but at least it runs now :D 
13:40  * qbit_ runs it really quick
13:41 < qbit_> brummmmm
13:43 < qbit_> bnoordhuis: [% 100|+ 140|-  14]: Done.  
13:43 < qbit_> gmake: *** [test] Error 14
13:43 < qbit_> core dumps after that 
13:43 < qbit_> run-tests does
13:44 < qbit_> i started debugging it for a bit.. but got distracted by something
13:44 < bnoordhuis> right, not too bad
13:44 < bnoordhuis> for an untested platform that is
13:44 < qbit_> yeah
13:49  * qbit_ fumbles around in gdb
13:50 < dr0id> Hey!
13:51 < augustl> I must say, express 3 is pretty brilliantly put together. The way apps uses (and is a) connect middlewares etc.
13:51 < dr0id> did they release it?
13:52 < augustl> dr0id: I'm using beta3 now
13:53 < dr0id> ok, 2.5.10 here :P
14:02 < qbit_> bnoordhuis: would any info from the core dump be useful to you? 
14:08 < guy> isaacs: may I ask why homepage URLs are not hyperlinks? http://search.npmjs.org/#/bstwitter
14:11 < AAA_awright> guy: They're linked somewhere in the header, though what gets linked and what doesn't I still can't figure out
14:16 < AAA_awright> Bah, MongoDB keys can't contain "."? What is the world coming to
14:16 < AAA_awright> Now how do I make key/value lists of URLs
14:16 < guy> AAA_awright: JSON can't, not MongoDB specifically.
14:17 < AAA_awright> guy: JSON can
14:17 < guy> unlikely.. let me try.
14:17 < dr0id> don't make keys have a '.'
14:17 < NodeX> you need to escape them as keys
14:18 < NodeX> not escape .. replace
14:18 < dr0id> keys shouldn't be more than a-z and _
14:18 < NodeX> AAA_awright : was it not you I went through this with a few weeks ago in #mongodb ?
14:19 < AAA_awright> JSON can encode any Javascript-legal value, including $ . _ unicode characters, NUL, etc
14:19 < NodeX> Mongodb is not Json
14:19 <@maxogden> mongodb is webscale
14:19 < AAA_awright> NodeX: Haven't been there...
14:19 < AAA_awright> Is /dev/null fast?
14:20 < totallymike> /dev/null is super fast when you write your logs to it
14:21 < NodeX> mongodb is the awesomez
14:21 < AAA_awright> Oh nice, I should enable this on my production servers right away
14:23 < AAA_awright> And now... How to escape keys in some sane, Node-ful way
14:23 < NodeX> you cant in mongo
14:23 < NodeX> you'll have to replace / clean them on the way in and out
14:24 < NodeX> most people use an underscore
14:35 < dshap> hey guys - is there any way to set the default assertion library in mocha to should.js?  or do i always have to run my tests with "mocha -r should" ?
14:37 < AAA_awright> NodeX: I'm looking to store completely arbritrary JSON-legal values, though
14:40 < ace> hello guys
14:40 < zjm1126> ??
14:40 < zjm1126> any one ?
14:40 < ace> is there a project that make it possible to make a classic application that you download and then run locally/offline
14:41 < ace> a phonegap but not for phone but for desktop
14:41 < equivoc> ace: app.js?
14:41 < equivoc> http://appjs.org/
14:41 < ace> equivoc: EXACTLY
14:41 < equivoc> :)
14:41 < equivoc> *strike*
14:41 < dshap> i guess that was a dumb question i asked, since "-r" is just shorthand for including require() before executing the test file.  guess i'll add require('should') to the top of each of my tests
14:42 < ace> equivoc: thanks so much, i didn't which word to use in google :)
14:42 < guy> dumb question. but, once I run a node using CLI, is it possible to run anything from the using CLI?
14:42 < guy> like trigger a particular function
14:43 < equivoc> guy: http://nodejs.org/api/repl.html
14:44 < equivoc> maybe that?
14:45 < guy> Wee, I need to run a specific file, and then be able say to trigger foo function from CLI
14:45 < equivoc> guy: check the repl api
14:45 < guy> Ok
14:46 < wereHamster> does vowsjs assume that the callbacks are passed err in the first argument?
14:54 < guy> equivoc: I don't get from docs, so I have https://gist.github.com/1c50854b647947e2af82 Now, how do I define callable functions?
14:55 < guy> should I bind them to repl.start().context = {} ?
14:56 < equivoc> guy: i don't know TBH, I'm just beginning with node
14:57 < guy> I was right.
14:58 < guy> While that's true for variables, no clue how that works with methods
15:00 < augustl> how do you typically do per environment configuration files that aren't checked in to git in express? Is there something built-in?
15:01 < augustl> something like a file config.json, with {"development": {... }, "production": {...}}, that's made available based on the current environment express runs in
15:02 <@isaacs> augustl: hey, what's your username?
15:02 <@isaacs> augustl: i'll fix it
15:02 < augustl> isaacs: augustl
15:05 < jsumners> I'm trying to figure out a bug in my script, but I think my "console.log"s are getting issued out-of-order (not sure). Is there a better way of tracing a script through node.js?
15:06 <@isaacs> augustl: try now
15:07 < context> well i doubt they can be called "out of order"
15:08 < augustl> isaacs: it seems to have worked, thanks
15:08 < jmb_> what's the best data store to use for a node chat server?
15:08 < jsumners> context, I mean that I don't know if the output is being written to stdout at the time that I make the call to console.log or at a later time
15:10 < context> someone can correct me if im wrong but, pretty sure even if console.log is evented, they will still be call[back]ed in the order they were initally called
15:11 < jsumners> okay
15:12 < equivoc> http://mygalaxies.s3.amazonaws.com/f3zxhd.png
15:13 < Geminizer> Hey guys... could anyone explain why I can run 'apt-get install nodejs' on ubuntu 11 but not ubuntu 10 ?  Am I missing something?
15:14 < augustl> Geminizer: the source list for 10 probably doesn't include node? :)
15:14 < jsumners> Geminizer, a backport?
15:17 < Geminizer> would this suffice:  add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js   ?
15:26 < yawnt> Geminizer: yup
15:30 < Geminizer> Nice... works now... thanks guys!
15:37 < eric_f> How can I tell npm to install `a@2.0.0` and `b@1.8.0` where `a` depends on `b`? I don't want `b@latest`.
15:39 < NodeX> 42
15:43 < eric_f> n/m Just realized I can `cd node_modules/a/ && npm i b@1.8.0`.

16:29 < dr0id> that's good
16:29 < dr0id> I want it to die/shutdown
16:29 < bnoordhuis> hacker news has been dead for ages now, it just hadn't realize it yet
16:30 < bnoordhuis> i remember when hn was a place where smart people hung out
16:30 < bnoordhuis> then the unwashed masses came
16:31 < retrobaby> oh yeah, all sort of crap gets upvoted there now
16:31 < dr0id> if you want to know how facebook will die in the next 5 years, or how some shithead company raised $10M funding from drunk VC's, then hackernews is for you
16:31 < retrobaby> woman won $31m against citigroup!? oh cmon, go read bloomberg if you want to post bloomberg links.
16:31 < Wise> 5 years, solid prediction!
16:31 < Wise> that's what it is in my dreams aswell, coincidence? :O
16:32 < retrobaby> well dr0id facebook can change it if they put their data to use and change their business model from making money from cheap ads
16:32 < dr0id> I don't care
16:32 < retrobaby> there was a good article abt this. there is just an ocean of social data it can use. but it doesnt
16:33 < dr0id> if they die, lots of man hours are going to be utilized for real work is all I know, kthx
16:33 < Wise> nah man that new thing is gonna become the new thing and the old thing will become the old
16:33 < Wise> im sure of it
16:33 < retrobaby> i dont have a problem with it giving my data to advertisers as long as it can create some cool tech
16:33 < dr0id> ya it can also give my data
16:33 < dr0id> all my private data
16:33 < dr0id> since its all fake
16:33 < Wise> ??I would rather it didnt
16:33 < retrobaby> if i dont want some data to be given to adverts i DONT upload it simple
16:33 < Wise> I regret signing up to fb
16:34 < dr0id> and I have 46 FB accounts, go FB go
16:34 < retrobaby> lol why uplaod anything "online" and ask it to be private, nothing dies on the interweb
16:34 < retrobaby> for the same reason i dont support online/cloud based  IDEs
16:34 < dr0id> if people don't do that then how are we going to see shitheads post nonsense articles on HN?
16:35 < dr0id> "Google Chrome Tracks your Internet Activity - Stop Using it Now"
16:35 < retrobaby> well there will always be shitheads for entertainment purposes, i dont care abt them
16:35 < dr0id> ye mate, so do we use IE9, cool story bro
16:35 < retrobaby> lol
16:35 < dr0id> "Facebook keeps on tracking you even after you Logout" - ohh cool, so that's what you discover at work instead of getting your shit done ? I'll let your boss no. kthx
16:36 < dr0id> YOUR BOZZ IS NOT PAYING YOU TO DISCOVER SHIT AND POST THEM ON HACKRNEWZ WASTING INTERNATZ BADNWIDTH
16:36 < NotMyself> facebook isnt doing anything doubleclick hasnt been doing for over a decade..
16:36 < retrobaby> there has to be a limit to what one can do on the public domain, i am not saying clouds are not cool, thats just primitive, but only use a cloud if you can set your own preferences
16:36 < dr0id> oh well, the interesting part is, they make it to the frontpage
16:36 < dr0id> :D
16:36 < Wise> >trusting private corporations
16:37 < Wise> is > still a thing?
16:37 < dominictarr> greater than?
16:37 < retrobaby> well meh, private corporation is private. no use talking abt it
16:37 < retrobaby> lets talk abt some socket goodness
16:37 < retrobaby> or some async module declarations
16:37 < retrobaby> ooh
16:38 < retrobaby> god i am going mad with Node, i started a few days ago, now i get node dreams, i need to slow down.
16:39 < nodenoob> hi! :) I've got a question.. I'm trying to port a bit of JS written for node, to the frontend where no node exists. The code explicitly uses Buffer, and i don't know what to make of it. Take a peek at: http://pastebin.com/TBvhncjC . How should i handle Buffer? Can i just assume its like and treat it like a string ? 
16:39 < retrobaby> make your own client side buffer! 
16:39 < nodenoob> i dont even know what a buffer is... :)
16:40 < retrobaby> lol
16:40 < nodenoob> no seriously
16:40 < nodenoob> how do i handle that?
16:42 < retrobaby> http://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html
16:42 < retrobaby> read that first
16:42 < nodenoob> just did. now i'm mad that JS doesnt handle binary data decently.
16:42 < nodenoob> so, wat do?
16:55 < retrobaby> nodenoob: have u tried unit8arrays?
16:59 < retrobaby> nodenoob: https://gist.github.com/2c65dc0435afd4cf208f u can start with this and work ahead.
17:00 < owen1> after reading this - https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/nodejs/WrkuKEco1O0 i made up my mind to learn the diffrence between classical, prototypal and functional OOP in javascript. here is my gist - http://pastebin.com/jn0Ht4jL  did i got it right? i still don't know what functional means or how it relates to classical or protytypal. any feedback is welcome.
17:05 < saapas> I'm trying to write a script that executes the ssh binary creating an ssh tunnel. the tunnel is created ok, but for some reason the callback function given to the child_process.exec() never returns.
17:06 < saapas> if I write child_process.exec('ls'), then the callback function returns.
17:07 < saapas> if I run 'ssh -f -N host' manually in the terminal, that also exits nicely and quickly
17:07 < game16> Hi
17:07 < game16> does anyone know any good resources for learning geddy?
17:07 < saapas> hello
17:13 < guy> retrobaby: did you have time to take a look at https://github.com/anuary/ay-game ?
17:14 < retrobaby> yeah i did look at it for a bit, i am working on adding some stuff
17:14 < guy> did you see the demo?
17:14 < guy> http://dev.anuary.com/1f1715ac-ad96-536a-a462-74381c7a2baf/
17:14 < retrobaby> its kinda random, i was thinking of adding different colors for new connections
17:14 < retrobaby> and stuff
17:15 < retrobaby> no
17:15 < guy> it is much less laggy now
17:15 < retrobaby> i will take a look at it
17:15 < retrobaby> did u change somehting?
17:15 < guy> Quiet a bid.
17:15 < guy> bit*
17:15 < retrobaby> oh good, push that shit, i will update my fork
17:16 < guy> I did
17:17 < retrobaby> lol good job with the colors
17:17 < guy> spacebar changes color
17:18 < retrobaby> cool i will read the new source at lunch time today
17:22 < milani> ping benvie
17:26 < milani> why there is no tag for v0.7.11 ?:)
17:27 < dshap> Does anyone here use mocha?  I'm trying "mocha --ignore-leaks --debug" but my code isn't breaking on debugger; statements.  Am I doing something wrong?
17:27 < milani> isaacs: node-gp tries to download http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.6.7/node.lib and 404 is returned.
17:33 < spasen> ciao
17:33 < spasen> list
17:37 <@isaacs> milani: yeah, that was before node-gyp was really supported as well as it is now.  you should be using a newer 0.6
17:38 <@isaacs> milani: we're not going to go back and re-do all the builds.
17:38 <@isaacs> milani: there is, it's just an orphan, because I had to hotpatch
17:38 <@isaacs> milani: (there is a tag for 0.7.11 and 0.7.11-fix
17:38 <@isaacs> but it's not an ancestor of master
17:40 < guy> isaacs: http://search.npmjs.org/ has annoying bug where it says no result for every query at first.
17:44 <@isaacs> guy: yep
17:46 < guy> Do you welcome contributions? I am exploring Node.js \w socket.io. Could play around to create new search for NPMs.
17:47 < guy> That's what I did yesterday. http://dev.anuary.com/1f1715ac-ad96-536a-a462-74381c7a2baf/ : )
17:47 < creationix> btw, the ws module is great!
17:47 < creationix> if you only care about web-socket capable browsers

17:53 < milani> guy, you can contribute on it. npm-www at isaacs' github
17:53 <@isaacs> guy: we're building a new website.
17:53 <@isaacs> guy: i've gotta get to some of the pull reqs, and upgrade some of the npm bits it's using.  been busy with getting 0.8 out
17:54 < guy> I can't see https://github.com/joyent/npm-www so I guess it is not public.

18:14 < otaku_coder> Hi, wondering if someone can help me. I am having issues running my express 2.x app. npm install -d runs successfully but when I try and start the app I get this - http://pastebin.com/XhViz166 . Any ideas? looks like npm isn't installing express properly. I am running npm v1.3.0 and node v0.6.19
18:26 < dshap> hey everyone, i'm having a strange issue with mocha - (http://pastebin.com/Pkqd11wf) - for some reason the console.log(i) outputs the last index every time.  what am i missing?
18:31 < AAA_awright> dshap: Because the loop has finished looping all the way through before the callback ever gets called.
18:31 < AAA_awright> *It is because
18:32 < dshap> AAA_awright: but aren't i "defining" the callbacks on each iteration of the loop?
18:32 < AAA_awright> Not quite
18:32 < dshap> AAA_awright: with a different value for "i" in each definition?
18:32 < AAA_awright> try this: for(var i = 0; i < partnerKeys.length; i++) (function(i){ ... })(i);
18:32 < dshap> if that makes sense..
18:34 < dshap> AAA_awright: yea i actually tried something similar a few minutes ago and it works.  i defined a function outside of the for loop that takes "i" as a parameter and then i call that function within the for loop
18:34 < dshap> AAA_awright: trying to understand why it works and the other doesn't
18:34 < AAA_awright> dshap: It might have something to do with your placement of the "var" operator and if the variable is a primitive or not
18:35 < dshap> hm
18:35 < Geminizer> does anyone happen to be using node highcharts?
18:38 < AAA_awright> dshap: What's the code that does work?
18:39 < dshap> AAA_awright: http://pastebin.com/MpArNqhG
18:41 < dshap> AAA_awright: i still don't understand…calling that external function is executing the same code that sets up the callback
18:41 < dshap> callbacks*
18:41 < AAA_awright> dshap: It's because it's inside a function. A function creates a new variable context in the closure chain, a for loop doesn't (though you'd expect a var j=i; in the body of the loop to, it doesn't.)
18:43 < dshap> AAA_awright: what causes i in the body of the loop to equal the last one?
18:44 < AAA_awright> dshap: It's all considered the same variable, and since the callback is executed after the for loop has run, it'll always have the same value
18:46 < dshap> AAA_awright: is this subtle or am i being dumb?  i sort of get it but don't feel like i understand it 100%
18:46 < AAA_awright> dshap: Or put it this way, you're only defining the function, not calling it. A new variable scope is only created when you call the function
18:47 < dshap> AAA_awright: ah
18:47 < AAA_awright> As opposed to if you did: for(var parent_i=0; ...) (function(i){ ... })(parent_i);
18:47 < AAA_awright> er, that's how to create the scope
18:48 < AAA_awright> So now if you looked at i vs parent_i you'd see what you expect in i, versus the same value every call for parent_i
18:48 < AAA_awright> Because they're in different scopes.
18:49 < dshap> AAA_awright: so on each iteration of the loop in my broken example, i'm calling "it()", but i'm only defining the callback as opposed to calling it
18:49 < AAA_awright> It's about as intuitive as global variables.
18:49 < AAA_awright> Right
18:49 < dshap> AAA_awright: so is the callback definition overwritten by each subsequent loop iteration?
18:50 < AAA_awright> dshap: Another thing you could do is have a function factory, have: function callbackFactory(i){ return function(){ /* existing callback code */ } }
18:50 < dshap> AAA_awright: at this point i'm not trying to solve the problem (already got that), just for my own education's sake trying to understand the concept that lead to thep problem in the first place
18:51 < dshap> AAA_awright: if i put a really slow operation in the for-loop, would that change things?
18:52 < AAA_awright> dshap: Maybe if it was threaded, but Node.js is not, the I/O won't be called until you finish the tick
18:52 < QaDeS> i'm having problems compiling node.js due to some openssl crap on osx. does anybody have experiences and knows how to solve that?
18:53 < AAA_awright> dshap: Maybe just open up node-inspector and look at the variable scope stack, note that i exists in the parent scope, not the local callback
18:54 < AAA_awright> If you want to have the behavior you expect you need to clone the value of i to a child scope
18:54 < AAA_awright> To a variable that won't change
18:55 < AAA_awright> QaDeS: Maybe post an error message?

19:12 < eddyb> wait, I know /facepalm
19:12 < denysonique> I am looking for a node module which makes this dead simple
19:12 < Octane> do you guys think it's gonna be a headche to upgrade from .6 to current?
19:13 < WarheadsSE> Octane: depends, have you checked your modules :P
19:13 < WarheadsSE> denysonique: maybe? http://search.npmjs.org/#/multiparter
19:15 < eddyb> WarheadsSE: NEEDED libv8.so.3 - not an exact version
19:16 < WarheadsSE> heh
19:16 < WarheadsSE> we all have derp in us
19:17 < eddyb> :(
19:17 < denysonique> WarheadsSE: I was hoping for something as simple as: a post request in jQuery: $.post("/test", { name: "John", time: "2pm" } );
19:17 < huangjs> hmm... cookie: {secure: true} is the problem. but why?
19:18 < WarheadsSE> eddyb: trust me, I've done that before, plenty of times
19:19 < jfroma_> denysonique use the request module
19:19 < eddyb> I had to use a different repo to get 0.6.19, because any other version would SEGFAULT when exiting
19:19 < jfroma_> https://github.com/mikeal/request
19:19 < Astro-> http://2010.nodeknockout.com/ :-(
19:20 < Octane> WarheadsSE that's what scares me lol
19:20 < denysonique> jfroma_: the request module doesn't allow me to easily define a POST querystringified request body
19:20 < jfroma_> oh, you can do this
19:20 < WarheadsSE> that body part is the "hard" part i think, for denysonique 
19:21 < denysonique> I want to do it exactly like here: $.post("/test", { name: "John", time: "2pm" } );
19:21 < jfroma_> denysoique it will be like request({url: .... + encodeURIComponents({stuff...})
19:21 < denysonique> why does it need to be more complicated?
19:21 < WarheadsSE> looks like its shown right in the README.md there denysonique 
19:21 < CIA-75> node: isaacs reviewme * r02a2898 / (4 files): Apply --no-deprecation to C++ warnings as well (+15 more commits...) - http://git.io/gcAu7Q
19:21 < jfroma_> that's not correct Sir.. when you do $.post(..., {}), the data part is in the body form encoded, not in the url
19:22 < jfroma_> when you do $.get(url, ...) is form encoded in the url
19:23 < denysonique> thats right
19:23 < denysonique> I would like a sugar for formencoded body
19:23 < denysonique> POST request
19:24 < WarheadsSE> "body - entity body for POST and PUT requests. Must be buffer or string"
19:24 < WarheadsSE> should be as simple as a methodcall
19:24 < jfroma_> then request({url: url, form: {your things} )

19:28 < jfroma_> does that work for you? in the request readme said that if you put "form" in the options .. it will form encode the body and put the right content type for the request
19:28 < jfroma_> so i think it should work fine
19:29 < denysonique> jfroma_: Yes it does, somehow I have skipped this option when reading the README when initially I tried to use request
19:29 < eddyb> WarheadsSE: do you have shared v8 or not?
19:29 < eddyb> I want to make sure of something
19:30 < CIA-75> node: isaacs master * r48c3d20 / (4 files): Apply --no-deprecation to C++ warnings as well - http://git.io/d1geJw
19:31 < WarheadsSE> eddyb: yeah, we use shared V8 on Arch Linux ARM
19:31 < denysonique> jfroma_: I am just curious, do you use CoffeeScript?
19:31 < WarheadsSE> If I compile from git with a non-matching V8 system lib i get those exact kinds of errors
19:31 < jfroma_> denysonique: yes, but i keep it in secret
19:32 < eddyb> WarheadsSE: can you paste the result of this in query for me? objdump -T /usr/lib64/libv8.so | grep IsNull
19:32 < eddyb> brb, food
19:32 < jfroma_> actually i am using both javascript, coffeescript and another weird thing called "iced coffee script" which i like for some cases
19:32 < jfroma_> the three
19:32 < WarheadsSE> I can, but it wont be lib64 :p
19:33 < WarheadsSE> 00031314 g    DF .text  00000084  Base        _ZNK2v85Value6IsNullEv

19:34 < WarheadsSE> pacman thats on V8 3.9.9 to match out 0.6.19

19:50 < WarheadsSE> k, then I would make sure that the 2 packages (V8 & Node) are matched to relatively the same package date
19:51 < eddyb> IsNull is an inlined function, something must've went wrong when it was compiling
19:51 < WarheadsSE> so you *are* compiling?
19:52 < eddyb> WarheadsSE: node-ref uses IsNull, and is compiled
19:53  * WarheadsSE tilts head
19:53 < eddyb> if you scroll up, the IsNull not found error comes from loading a native module

20:29 < ericm_> Hello all. I have a quick question. I have a base class that is in controller.js. I have a separate file called testController.js that uses Object.create to create a subclass of the object defined in controller.js. What I want to do is figure out, from within the base class, the name of the file that contains the subclass. Any ideas? __filename always returns controller.js.
20:30 < ericm_> Basically, I need the method in the base class to be aware of its subclass, if that makes sense.
20:35 < zomg> ericm_: why?
20:36 < zomg> Usually if a base class needs to know about its subclasses, something is wrong =)
20:36 < zomg> Of course there might be some use case for it but at least in my experience most of the time there are better ways
20:37 < ericm_> I'm working on a node.js application framework. I'm trying to create a base class for a controller that will be inherited from for specific controllers. The controller needs to return the name of an associated client-side JS file. For instance, the controller firstController.js would return "first.js" as its client-side JS file name. Instead of specifying the name of the file in all the subclasses, I wanted a method on the 
20:37 < ericm_> base class that could infer it somehow.

20:40 < ericm_> zmog: BTW, I generally agree with you, but I think this is one of those exceptions.
20:41 < ericm_> zomg: Whoops, typo there
20:45 < zomg> ericm_: have you considered using some kind of a constructor method of your own? Eg. Controller.create('nameOfController', { foo: function() { ... }, bar: ... })? That way the name could easily be taken from the name string given as the parameter
20:46 < ericm_> zomg: Yup, that's my fallback if there is no other way to infer it.
20:47 < ericm_> zomg: I think I'll go that route. It would give me some good opportunity to do some other things too. Thanks for your help.

21:19 < motiooon_> how would I measure the content-length of a req.body
21:19 < motiooon_> ?
21:23 < motiooon_> does anybody know how to make a request and not to be with chunks ?
21:23 < motiooon_> a http post
21:23 < motiooon_> with req.write("data")
21:23 < viric> ah sqlite is not sqlite3.
21:23 < bnoordhuis> motiooon_: set a Content-Length header
21:23 < motiooon_> yes but how would I know the content length ?
21:23 < bnoordhuis> motiooon_: are you the client or the server?
21:24 < motiooon_> client in this case
21:24 < game16> Does anyone here use geddy?
21:24 < motiooon_> I am both client and server 
21:24 < bnoordhuis> motiooon_: in that case you're at the mercy of what the server sends you
21:25 < motiooon_> I'm making a call from my web app to a web service 
21:25 < motiooon_> I can control both
21:25 < bnoordhuis> motiooon_: have your server set the Content-Length header. i'm assuming you know how big the response body is going to be
21:25 < bnoordhuis> if not, well, that's what chunked encoding was invented for
21:26 < bnoordhuis> motiooon_: btw, your data callback may still get called multiple times
21:26 < bnoordhuis> node doesn't buffer
21:26 < bnoordhuis> it just hands off the data as it comes in over the wire
21:26 < motiooon_> how would I do that ?
21:26 < motiooon_> is there any event ?
21:27 < bnoordhuis> event for what?
21:27 < motiooon_> for the server to know when receives data and when the receive was complete 
21:28 < bnoordhuis> motiooon_: your client sending is sending data to the server?
21:30 < motiooon_> yes
21:31 < motiooon_> the client is sending in chunks because i don't know the content length
21:31 < motiooon_> but the server responds on the first chunk
21:31 < motiooon_> I want the server to know when the client finished sending so it can process the data that I'm sending
21:32 < motiooon_> this is how I write on client
21:32 < motiooon_> req.write(JSON.stringify(data));
21:32 < bnoordhuis> motiooon_: attach 'data' and 'end' listeners to the req object (in the server)
21:32 < motiooon_> aha!
21:32 < motiooon_> that's the secret
21:32 < motiooon_> I think that will work
21:33 < bnoordhuis> it should, we built it that way :)
21:33 < motiooon_> but what if I'm using express on the server
21:33 < motiooon_> ?
21:33 < bnoordhuis> then you should ask tjholowaychuk
21:33 < bnoordhuis> i hear he's pretty good with express
21:33 < motiooon_> :)
21:33 < motiooon_> ok thanks for your help
21:33 < bnoordhuis> my pleasure :)
21:33 < tjholowaychuk> motiooon_ req, res are the same objects that node gives you
21:34 < tjholowaychuk> so you can do what bnoordhuis mentioned
21:34 < motiooon_> cool, thanks both of you
21:34 < tjholowaychuk> instead of req.write(JSON.stringify(data)); you can do
21:34 < tjholowaychuk> res.send(data) though
21:34 < tjholowaychuk> up to you
21:35 < tjholowaychuk> that will json-stringify it for you and set the content-{type,length} etc

21:53 < bnoordhuis> jfroma: not unless you copy them to the new context
21:55 < jfroma> thanks
22:20 < AlbireoX`Laptop> Hi, how could I do a bidirectional relationship like this in Mongoose: http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-mongodb-odm/en/latest/reference/bidirectional-references.html
22:24 < aheckmann> AlbireoX`Laptop: http://mongoosejs.com/docs/populate.html
22:24 < AlbireoX`Laptop> aheckmann: thanks
22:25 < aheckmann> AlbireoX`Laptop: anytime
22:26 < myndzi> i have a module that i call like: require('./helpers')();
22:26 < myndzi> the module's export assigns various functions to the global object
22:26 < myndzi> global.foo = function () {};
22:27 < AlbireoX`Laptop> aheckmann: one more question, why would you use [{ type: Schema.ObjectId, ref: 'Person' }] over [Person.schema] ?
22:27 < myndzi> i was trying to pass a parameter to affect the behavior of these functions without success, i expect there's some weird scoping stuff going on that i don't understand
22:27 < myndzi> any idea how i can get that to work?
22:28 < aheckmann> myndzi: its b/c all you are saving is an objectid, not the entire tree
22:28 < aheckmann> the objected is a ref to the actual doc from the other collection
22:28 < myndzi> i thought i would be able to change the parent module's global variable directly but that didn't work either
22:28 < AlbireoX`Laptop> I see
22:28 < AlbireoX`Laptop> thanks
22:29 < myndzi> i put a conditional inside the function to check a variable, tried setting a variable in the helper module based on passed parameters, and tried setting a variable on the parent module's global object
22:29 < myndzi> i can't seem to access either
22:29 < aheckmann> myndzi: once you pass a schema into model() it gets compiled into a new "class" so changing it after the fact has no affect
22:30 < aheckmann> myndzi: we also have the #mongoosejs room
22:30 < myndzi> mmk
22:30 < aheckmann> btw, feel free to post a gist
22:30  * AlbireoX`Laptop joins that room
22:30 < AlbireoX`Laptop> aheckmann: I'm assuming you were talking to me, not myndzi?
22:30 < myndzi> it's not a big deal, just a convenience
22:30 < myndzi> AlbireoX`Laptop: yeah, i think his nick completer went haywire ;D
22:31 < AlbireoX`Laptop> :p
22:31 < aheckmann> haha
22:31 < aheckmann> fail

22:51 < Weems> I got an error whan running make test, is this the place for support for it?
22:52 < Weems> when*
22:52 < Weems> http://pastie.org/4129056
22:55 < bnoordhuis> Weems: yes, you're in the right place
22:55 < bnoordhuis> that test is a little spotty
22:56 < bnoordhuis> if you run `python tools/test.py --mode=release simple/test-regress-GH-1697` there's a fair chance it'll pass 2 out of 3 runs
23:08 < php14> i'm looking at mongoose source, can someone explain why "handleSave" is called(?) as the callback for tick() http://pastie.org/4129128
23:11 < lohkey> i was just source diving around in socket.io. It appears that the "flash socket" works by implementing web socket support in flash. Does anybody know if this is true?
23:12 < bnoordhuis> lohkey: yes, it's a fallback mechanism for when the browser doesn't natively support websockets
23:13 < lohkey> thats awesome, thanks for clearing that up for me bnoordhuis

23:21 < axisys> I just copied the snmpjs code from http://wesolows.github.com/node-snmpjs/ and ran it in ubuntu 12.04 and I get this error http://dpaste.com/762177/
23:21 < axisys> what gives?
23:22 <@Nexxy> axisys, you should install the snmpjs module
23:23 < axisys> I ran this first.. let me run it again
23:23 < axisys> npm install snmpjs
23:25 < axisys> Nexxy: http://dpaste.com/762179/
23:26 < axisys> [Error: Cannot find module './DTraceProviderBindings'] 
23:26 < axisys> hmm.. so can't run on ubuntu?
23:27 <@Nexxy> lol
23:27 < axisys> also Error: Cannot find module 'bunyan'
23:27 <@Nexxy> last I've heard dtrace doesn't work out of the box on anything but SmartOS
23:27 <@Nexxy> but I could be wrong
23:27 <@Nexxy> axisys, also you should probably install bunyan as well
23:27 < axisys> so cannot use snmpjs 
23:28 <@Nexxy> you probably can with enough work
23:29 < axisys> $ sudo node file.js
23:29 < axisys> [Error: Cannot find module './DTraceProviderBindings']
23:29 < axisys> {"name":"snmpd","hostname":"ghar-iqbala","pid":27401,"component":"snmp-agent","level":30,"msg":"Bound to 0.0.0.0:161","time":"2012-06-21T23:29:11.723Z","v":0}
23:29 <@Nexxy> \o/
23:29 < axisys> it should have been warning .. not error
23:29 <@Nexxy> great success!
23:29 < othiym23> Nexxy: axisys: large bits of DTrace work on OS X, and it's shipped with the dev tools
23:30 <@Nexxy> http://youtu.be/v3rhQc666Sg
23:30 < axisys> othiym23: i know.. not sure why dtrace is needed for snmpjs
23:30 < othiym23> but all the super nice bits dpacheco uses in his debugging posts only work on Illumos
23:31 < othiym23> https://github.com/mcavage/node-ldapjs/issues/64
23:31 < axisys> othiym23: thanks
23:32 < othiym23> axisys: so maybe 'sudo npm install dtrace-provider' will do the trick?
23:33 < axisys> othiym23: error still there http://dpaste.com/762182/
23:35 < othiym23> axisys: cd node_modules/snmpjs ; rm -r node_modules/dtrace-provider ; sudo npm install dtrace-provider@0.0.8 ?
23:38 < axisys> cd node_modules you mean?
23:38 < othiym23> nope!
23:38 < othiym23> node modules have their own local copies of modules
23:40 < axisys> iqbala@ghar-iqbala:~/node_modules/snmpjs$ ls 
23:40 < axisys> agent.js    deps  lib       Makefile.deps  node_modules  README.md  test
23:40 < axisys> agent.json  docs  Makefile  Makefile.targ  package.json  smf        tools
23:41 < axisys> there is a node_moudles dir inside 
23:41 < othiym23> yeah
23:41 < axisys> i follow you
23:41 < othiym23> and there should be a dtrace-provider directory in that node_modules directory
23:41 < othiym23> that you want to nuke and then replace, rebuilding it with root permissions
23:42 < axisys> i see
23:42 < WarheadsSE> that part of the packaging system is annoying
23:42 < WarheadsSE> jus'sayin
23:43 < othiym23> WarheadsSE: it's annoying until you have two packages with conflicting dependencies
23:43 < othiym23> and then it suddenly gets a lot less annoying
23:43 < axisys> othiym23: still no worky
23:43 < axisys> iqbala@ghar-iqbala:~$ ls node_modules/
23:43 < axisys> bunyan  dtrace-provider  ldapjs  snmpjs
23:43 < axisys> iqbala@ghar-iqbala:~$ ls node_modules/snmpjs/node_modules/
23:43 < axisys> asn1  bunyan  dtrace-provider  jison
23:44 < axisys> it kind a works like before
23:44 < axisys> http://dpaste.com/762188/
23:44 < othiym23> hmmm... I'm out of ideas, then
23:45 < CIA-75> libuv: Bert Belder master * rea3e2cd / (src/win/fs.c src/win/internal.h src/win/util.c): windows: get rid of overly complicated uv_filetime_to_time_t helper - http://git.io/HtVzkQ
23:48 < othiym23> axisys: reading the source, the absence of the DTrace provider shouldn't affect you too much
