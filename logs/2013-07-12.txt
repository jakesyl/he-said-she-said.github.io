00:04 < azbyin> guys, anyone want to explain this?
00:04 < azbyin> >> function t(o){return Object.create(o);}; t({v:42});
00:04 < purr> azbyin: (object) {}
00:04 < durango> azbyin: :D
00:05 < durango> told you guys
00:05 < durango> @isaacbw @sorensen
00:05 < durango> same result in 0.8.25 and 0.10.12
00:06 <@isaacbw> what do you think Object.create does
00:06 <@xyxne> lol
00:06 <@xyxne> oh dear
00:06 <@isaacbw> >> function t(o){return new Object(o);}; t({v:42});
00:06 < purr> isaacbw: (object) {v: 42}
00:07 <@isaacbw> Object.create(proto [, propertiesObject ])
00:07 < durango> so it needs a prototype
00:07 <@isaacbw> 0.8.* is still really old
00:07 <@xyxne> hey, no
00:08 <@isaacbw> DON'T TOUCH MAH NODE

00:11 < serapath> i now have read a bit about async and similar libs and promises and some other kind of approaches. they all do lots of stuff, but the only thing i'm curently searching for is a library, that gives me a way of specifying dependencies between them
00:11 < serapath> and giving me a method of how to combine different results into an input for a function which is dependent on one or more predecessors
00:12 < serapath> of which some could be optional predecessors
00:12 < serapath> all could run in parallel expect that which cannot
00:12 < serapath> which is specified through the dependency model i write down
00:12 < serapath> does that sound familiar to anyone?
00:14 < serapath> avoiding 'pyramid of doom' or having a 'error handling mechanism' is secondary for me
00:15 < xyxne> serapath, https://github.com/caolan/async#auto 
00:15 < xyxne> ?
00:17 <@isaacbw> secret op
00:17 <@isaacbw> ninja op
00:17 < briefcaseofguts> op op
00:17 < briefcaseofguts> serapath: xyxne is right, async.auto looks tight
00:18 < serapath> i'm reading
00:18 < xyxne> xyxne is always right
00:18 < briefcaseofguts> that burger in the topic is lookin right
00:19 < briefcaseofguts> who has a cool app to show off? im waiting for a compile, someone show off their stuff
00:21 < briefcaseofguts> whatever ill go smoke :p
00:26 < serapath> briefcaseofguts: xyxne looks like it's going in the right direction, but i'm not yet sure if it can handle arbitrary dependencies (circular dependencies aside)
00:27 < serapath> maybe it can, but i'm not yet sure. it feels like it cannot
00:27 < briefcaseofguts> serapath: php is what you need bro
00:27 < briefcaseofguts> lmao
00:27 < serapath> php?
00:27 < serapath> why?
00:27 < briefcaseofguts> ahh y not/
00:27 < serapath> i dont know, have coded a bit of php and it did not feel right
00:28 < briefcaseofguts> ;P
00:28 < Pl2> And layers of nested callbacks feel right? :p
00:29 < sorensen> blah
00:29 < sorensen> back, comp ran out of battery
00:29 < sorensen> briefcaseofguts: https://www.genoglyphix.com/browser/18/1/212100000/234600000/
00:29 < serapath> but back to javascript, how would i write the following dependency tree, given all letters represent functions and  xyz|b means b depends on the results of xyz, while xyz|ab is shorthand for xyz|a , xyz|b ... eventually, options, to signal wether some dependencies are optional or not would be great
00:29 < briefcaseofguts> i know right, but if you think w/ concurrency they do feel right, its a trip tho, 
00:31 < briefcaseofguts> this is pretty cool
00:31 < serapath> but without the "options thing", i wonder if i could use async.auto to  (a,b,c,d,e,f,g), ab|h, ac|i, ad|j, def|k, hi|L, hj|M, hik|N, LMN|O
00:32 < briefcaseofguts> sorensen: how high was your ui designer wow this is good
00:32  * sorensen was the UI designer
00:33 < briefcaseofguts> heh
00:33 < briefcaseofguts> i suspected that ;)
00:33 < sorensen> wrote all of it
00:33 < sorensen> css/js
00:33 < niggler> hi friends
00:33 < niggler> hi euphrate 
00:33 < sorensen> best part is you can only see 5% of the data on public
00:34 < azbyin> lol niggler 
00:34 < niggler> sorensen you have the notation inverted
00:34 < sorensen> nothing like rending ~700k elements in canvas :P
00:34 < sorensen> oh?
00:34 < sorensen> what notation
00:34 < niggler> it should be b|xyz
00:34 < niggler> b conditional on x,y,z
00:34 < neeky> briefcaseofguts, not mine, but: http://www.node-console.com/ is pretty cool
00:34 < sorensen> have no idea what you mean
00:35 < niggler> nope that was serapath 
00:35 < niggler> nvm
00:35 < sorensen> are you referring to the basepairs of the chromozone?
00:35 < serapath> niggler: ok, i dont know, made up the syntax
00:35 < niggler> no serapath wrote "xyz|b means b depends on the results of xyz,"
00:35 < sorensen> i think my genetic sequence is correct :P
00:35 < niggler> whereas the syntax is traditionally b|xyz
00:35 < serapath> if u prefer it that way, i'm fine with that
00:35 < sorensen> also, your handle is fucked
00:35 < serapath> ok, so be it :-)
00:35 < briefcaseofguts> thats like a meme or something... i dont always render 700,000 html elements, but when i do, <canvas>
00:36 < niggler> sorensen http://wordsmith.org/words/niggler.html
00:36 < sorensen> niggler: what reference is your handle other than the obvious?
00:36 < niggler> its the obvious
00:36 < sorensen> :(
00:36 < niggler> if you define the obvious as the dictionary definition
00:37 < sorensen> when was the word created
00:37 < niggler> earliest documented use 1781
00:37 < futuredale> at the beginning of repl.js there's `module.filename = path.resolve('repl');`
00:37 < serapath> niggler, is it possible to define such a dependency graph for functions in javascript?
00:37 < futuredale> meant to fix relative requires
00:37  * sorensen sigh
00:37 < niggler> serapath have you looked at npm.im/async
00:37 < serapath> and combine results when dependencies are met and just execute them in parallel when there is no dependency?
00:37 < sorensen> niggler: like when faggot was just a bundle of sticks?
00:37 < niggler> faggot is still a unit of measure
00:38  * sorensen sigh
00:38 < serapath> niggler: yes, i'm currently doing this, but from the example its hard to grasp how to do that in async
00:38 < futuredale> is that because the defaultEval doesn't create a module and thus uses the eval's filename?
00:38 < brainproxy> sorensen: very cool looking :)
00:38 < niggler> in fact sorensen faggot was standardized in 1474
00:38  * garthk is also running into https://github.com/substack/tape/issues/40 but without using test.only…
00:38 < niggler> predating niggler by 3 centuries
00:39 < sorensen> i do love that you miss the point entirely, or are just avoiding it
00:39 < sorensen> ++
00:39 < brainproxy> sorensen: on the internet, someone is always wrong
00:39 < niggler> are you on queer street sorensen ?
00:40 < serapath> hey, this channel is called #node.js for a reason
00:40 < briefcaseofguts> to talk about php
00:41 < niggler> you know briefcaseofguts id bet that the collective php competency on #node.js exceeds that in #php
00:41 < serapath> if its possible to do that with async, could someone give me a pastebin or something with a dependency graph like the one i described?
00:41 < niggler> or ##php or whatever they call the chat
00:41 < briefcaseofguts> thats why im here
00:41 < serapath> i really dont get it how to do more complex dependency structures from the examples provided by async
00:41 < niggler> how do you handle optional dependencies?
00:41 < serapath> is there parallel execution in php?
00:42 < serapath> why would i need this dependency thing in php?
00:42 < briefcaseofguts> ill write one imo
00:42 < niggler> serapath do you know the dependencies ahead of time?
00:43 < niggler> or is that stored in a special structure?
00:43 < serapath> niggler i dont know, i would do something like (o)abcd|g and o contains information wether some of abcd is optional this time
00:43 < euphrate> how are you niggler 
00:43 < serapath> or maybe the other way round, because u like it traditionally
00:43 < serapath> so g|dcba(o)
00:43 < serapath> or something
00:43 < niggler> what i mean serapath is that do you know the functions upfront?
00:43 < niggler> or is it completely dynamic
00:43 < niggler> hey euphrate 
00:43 < serapath> niggler: yes i do
00:44 < serapath> not thought about what happens when dependencies can be decided in the proces, maybe i update o and its checked constantly
00:44 < niggler> can you give a concrete example?
00:44 < serapath> which means, after a function 'returned'
00:44 < serapath> initialize a database
00:44 < serapath> have a function authCallback
00:45 < serapath> which is used if the password needs a password
00:45 < serapath> and not if it doesnt
00:45 < serapath> depends on wether a password is given or not
00:46 < serapath> eventually there is some information the db will give me, which decides what kind of stuff it needs from me, thus, as soon as i get that information, i update the options given to the dependencies
00:47 < serapath> but even without the options, it would be fine to just have the dependency thing, because i can still make an if statement in the functions that are optional and check whether something has to be done or not
00:49  * sorensen sigh...
00:50 < sorensen> nothing like using your intelect to avoid an obvious racist handle/nick
00:50 < sorensen> its almost as if... the meaning of words change over 200 years
00:50 < sorensen> so strange
00:50 < brainproxy> sorensen: not sure how long you've used irc; but typically if someone has a nick like that, they want to have a nick like that, and giving it attention is actually what they want
00:51 < sorensen> i understand that ;)
00:51 < sorensen> but i do like pointing out the obvious
00:51 < serapath> niggler: the module i was writing that caused me to dig into this was: http://pastebin.com/1e3yNgE9 which has three statements which could be run in parralel, but it depends on wether a password is given or not to decide about the execution of redis_client.auth(...)
00:51 < sorensen> i also like this channel / community and hate to see someone subtley alienate anyone
00:52 < sorensen> if i were to change my nick to faggot could i just reference a dictionary link on what it used to mean?
00:52 < sorensen> probably be ok right?
00:52  * sorensen just sayin
00:53 -!- mode/#Node.js [+o TooTallNate] by ChanServ
00:53 < niggler> sorensen in this particular case it's pretty apt
00:53 < sorensen> says the guy/gal with the handle in question ;)
00:53 < serapath> hey, there is a dependency programming question and this channel is called #node.js
00:54 < serapath> wtf? are u talking about?? :-)
00:55 < niggler> sorensen the dictionary has rendered judgment in my favor
00:55 < andrewaclt> Does node not support Number.toLocaleString() ?
00:56 < niggler> andrewaclt its a prototype function
00:56 < sorensen> niggler: perhaps: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/swastika
00:57 < andrewaclt> niggler, I know I have a number and it's not being printed in a locale friendly manner
00:58 < niggler> sorensen swastika itself is not offensive
00:59 < niggler> in fact, most hindu temples have depictions of the swastika
00:59 < andrewaclt> niggler, I think this is the issue https://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=1034
01:00 < sorensen> we are getting too off topic
01:00 < sorensen> sorry for finding your name offensive and rascist niggler
01:00 < sorensen> you have the dictionary on your side
01:00 < sorensen> case dismissed
01:00 < niggler> strictly speaking sorensen the fact that you take offense to particular uses of the words "niggler" or "faggot" or "swastika" reflects poorly on yourself
01:00 < niggler> but again, we end the discussion
01:01 < sorensen> as much as i would love to refute that, i will not, off topic ;)
01:01 < sorensen> another time perhaps?
01:02 < niggler> andrewaclt that's funny http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.7.4.3
01:02 < andrewaclt> This function is implementation-dependent, and it is permissible, but not encouraged, for it to return the same thing as toString.
01:02 < andrewaclt> boo
01:03 < andrewaclt> I hate adding a dependency for one currency being displayed on one page
01:04 < briefcaseofguts> did anyone ever see that lil bow wow movie, like mike? thats how i feel about php, it is lil bow wow over node
01:06 <@isaacbw> did v8 get a new logo recently
01:11 < niggler> andrewaclt is there a standard implementation?
01:11 < niggler> the spec is too vague
01:11 < andrewaclt> niggler, no there are packages that provide i18n currency support
01:11 < niggler> but it seems that chrome does something
01:16 < altusllc> anyone have any general tips for flattening out this nested callback hell I feel like i'm entering?
01:16 < euphrate> async.js atatsu 
01:16 < euphrate> altusllc*
01:17 < altusllc> this one: https://github.com/caolan/async?
01:18 < euphrate> yes
01:20 < altusllc> cool thx
01:36 < serapath> wow, found something interesting
01:36 < serapath> https://github.com/olado/causeeffect
01:44 < vrlogrs> hi guys
01:44 < vrlogrs> if an uncaughtexception error is thrown in a module, can the parent process not see the stack/line numbers?
01:45 < vrlogrs> like, if i had process.on(uncaughtException...) 
01:45 < vrlogrs> but the exception happened in a module
01:46 < vrlogrs> im only getting error = Uncaught Exception: ReferenceError: hands is not defined
01:46 < vrlogrs> no stack or line numbers
01:46 < briefcaseofguts> i dont know but if theirs an exception object that stuff should be encluded
01:47 < briefcaseofguts> included*
01:47 < vrlogrs> does the module need to explicitly throw the error for the parent to get all the info?
01:49 < briefcaseofguts> no
01:49 < briefcaseofguts> i guess you should use domains
01:49 < briefcaseofguts> the docs say:
01:49 < briefcaseofguts> Note that uncaughtException is a very crude mechanism for exception handling and may be removed in the future.  Don't use it, use domains instead. If you do use it, restart your application after every unhandled exception!
01:49 < rhalff_tc> serapath, it seems more elegant than promises. setState is a bit of a weird naming though.
01:49 < briefcaseofguts> You have been warned.
01:49 < briefcaseofguts> so i dunno, use domains?
01:49 < vrlogrs> never heard of domains :S
01:50 < vrlogrs> used for error handling?
01:50 < briefcaseofguts> ya
01:50 < briefcaseofguts> vrlogrs: http://nodejs.org/api/all.html#all_event_uncaughtexception
01:51 < briefcaseofguts> vrlogrs: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7310521/node-js-best-practice-exception-handling see the last code block in the first answers
01:53 < vrlogrs> i dont this will help in my problem though briefcaseofguts ..
01:53 < vrlogrs> im not seeing stack/line numbers in the output
01:54 < niggler> serapath did you look at async.auto?
01:54 < serapath> yes, but like i said, i dont get it from the example given
01:55 < briefcaseofguts> vrlogrs: wait your doing php right?
01:56 < mscdex> konobi: voila.js?!
01:57 < vrlogrs> no, node.js
01:57 < briefcaseofguts> vrlogrs: kidding :/  yea that stackoverflow was wrong topic i think
01:57 < briefcaseofguts> vrlogrs: the main thing is from nodejs docs. "uncaught exception Emitted when an exception bubbles all the way back to the event loop. If a listener is added for this exception, the default action (which is to print a stack trace and exit) will not occur."
01:58 < briefcaseofguts> so basically u dont want to catch it if you want the stack trace, my bad
01:58 < vrlogrs> oh
01:58 < vrlogrs> that sux .. :(
01:58 < briefcaseofguts> seems so
01:58 < vrlogrs> i wanted to catch the error, output it, and then exit 
01:59 < vrlogrs> wait, the process would do that on its own anyways ..
01:59 < vrlogrs> right, but i wanted to add a time
01:59 < briefcaseofguts> yea
01:59 < vrlogrs> so, 17:00: error: uncaughtexception: blahblah
02:00 < briefcaseofguts> you can pipe your program output to some sort of script that adds that time cmd, forget the unix cmd for this, im sure its built in
02:00 < briefcaseofguts> but then you dont see anything 
02:00 < briefcaseofguts> unless u write a script that both prints it and logs the output and pipe your whole app through that
02:00 < shoky> uhm don't the error objects have a "stack" property?
02:00 < briefcaseofguts> idk, this is getting overly complex
02:00 < vrlogrs> shoky: for whatever reason, it doesnt :S
02:00 < vrlogrs> its just a string
02:01 < shoky> when using domains?
02:03 < niggler> serapath oh its an object
02:03 < vrlogrs> shoky: i havent used domains yet ..
02:03 < vrlogrs> it says they are unstable
02:03 < vrlogrs> and im on v10.4
02:03 < niggler> vrlogrs you need to update
02:04 < vrlogrs> but domains are still unstable :P
02:04 < serapath> niggler what?
02:05 < mscdex> konobi: boom!
02:05 < shoky> vrlogrs: so what? docs for uncaughtException say "Don't use it, use domains instead."
02:05 < vrlogrs> lol
02:05 < vrlogrs> fine fine .. 
02:06 < vrlogrs> are there any issues with the latest version of node.js ?
02:06 < vrlogrs> anything i should be aware of? i dont want everything crashing as soon as i update
02:07 < mscdex> vrlogrs: read the changelog?
02:09 < vrlogrs> mscdex: im paranoid :P
02:09 < briefcaseofguts> vrlogrs: i think its not a string, im debugging this
02:09 < briefcaseofguts> and if i get a referencceError
02:09 < briefcaseofguts> it has a type of uncaughtException
02:09 < briefcaseofguts> so their might be hidden properties on this
02:10 < vrlogrs> so .. :S
02:11 <@konobi> mscdex: =0)
02:13 < shoky> vrlogrs: so yeah, uncaughtException's also have a "stack" property
02:14 < vrlogrs> when i do process.on('uncaughtException', function(err) { console.log(JSON.stringify(err)); });
02:14 < vrlogrs> outputs {}
02:16 < shoky> huh
02:16 < shoky> why would you JSON.stringify it
02:16 < briefcaseofguts> ugh
02:16 < briefcaseofguts> i just did all that too
02:16 < shoky> console.log( err.stack )
02:16 < briefcaseofguts> to see whats in it, they arent strings, but objects
02:16 < briefcaseofguts> vrlogrs: http://www.node-console.com/script/errs-are-not-strings
02:16 < briefcaseofguts> or what shoky just put
02:16 < briefcaseofguts> its err.stack
02:17 < briefcaseofguts> also my require at the top does nothing so yea
02:17 <@konobi> vrlogrs: or use node.panic
02:17 <@konobi> um... node-panic
02:19 < briefcaseofguts> ^^
02:19 < briefcaseofguts> or rewrite it in a real language, like php
02:19 < briefcaseofguts> >:]
02:20  * Aredridel snorts.
02:23 < LoneSoldier728> hey
02:23 < vrlogrs> got it
02:23 < vrlogrs> thanks guys
02:23 < vrlogrs> appreciate it :)
02:24 < briefcaseofguts> gl
02:24 < LoneSoldier728> so guys, $('input').change(function() {
02:24 < LoneSoldier728>     				if(!this.model.isValid()) {
02:24 < LoneSoldier728>     				console.log('run');
02:24 < LoneSoldier728>     				$('.save').attr("disabled", "disabled");
02:24 < LoneSoldier728>     				} else {
02:24 < LoneSoldier728>     					console.log('run2');
02:24 < LoneSoldier728>     					alert('Changes have been made.')
02:24 < LoneSoldier728>     					$('.save').removeAttr("disabled");
02:24 < LoneSoldier728>     					this.render();
02:24 < LoneSoldier728>     				}
02:24 < LoneSoldier728> what is wrong with this picture?
02:24 < shoky> no
02:24 < LoneSoldier728> the disabled attr stays
02:25 < LoneSoldier728> I am trying to have it keep re-validating
02:25 < shoky> is that even node related
02:25 < LoneSoldier728> its js
02:25 < LoneSoldier728> backbone
02:25 < LoneSoldier728> front end of my node
02:25 < shoky> so, not node
02:25 < LoneSoldier728> i guess technically not so i guess nvm it
02:26 < jesusabdullah> LoneSoldier728: tab characters, useless console.logs, jquery and not noads
02:26 < LoneSoldier728> hate client side shit
02:26 < jesusabdullah> LoneSoldier728: try .keyup instead of .change ?
02:26 < LoneSoldier728> I am all about the SERVER SIDE
02:26 < jesusabdullah> LoneSoldier728: saw that trick in an angular demo of all things XD
02:27 < LoneSoldier728> yeah I am actually having bigger problems than I thought though
02:27 < LoneSoldier728> it is saying isValid is undefined
02:28 < shoky> "this" is the input element
02:28 < LoneSoldier728> let me see maybe I can do something
02:28 < LoneSoldier728> with the keyup
02:28 < LoneSoldier728> ya i know let me take a crack
02:28 < shoky> with keyup as well
02:28 < shoky> #jquery
02:32 < LoneSoldier728> ya the keyup is like steroids
02:32 < LoneSoldier728> keeps popping up every character lol
02:34 < LoneSoldier728> yo trying to meet cool people
02:34 < LoneSoldier728> jesus anyway we can link up?
02:35 < LoneSoldier728> or shoky so i can spew more non node stuff to u lol jk
02:36 < shoky> wat
02:36 < LoneSoldier728> anyone from ny?
02:36 < LoneSoldier728> or ca?
02:36 < LoneSoldier728> wanted to connect on skype or something
02:36 < vrlogrs> CA
02:37 < vrlogrs> Canadian, currently in California :)
02:37 < vrlogrs> CA and CA
02:37 < LoneSoldier728> haha visiting?
02:37 < vrlogrs> working
02:37 < LoneSoldier728> anything exciting?
02:37 < vrlogrs> definitely :)
02:37 < vrlogrs> money-making :)
02:37 < LoneSoldier728> programming?
02:38 < vrlogrs> i got way too much stuff going on right now .. i'll have to tty in a bit .. 
02:38 < vrlogrs> im me later if u wanna chat
02:38 < LoneSoldier728> kk

02:41 < shoky> yes
02:41 < LoneSoldier728> why do all israelis
02:41 < LoneSoldier728> well a lot of them hate it
02:41 < LoneSoldier728> and try to get out of it
02:41 < LoneSoldier728> i think its a great duty and experience
02:41 < shoky> i'm not gonna get into it ;p
02:41 < LoneSoldier728> how old are you
02:41 < shoky> into a discussion about it, i mean

02:41 < shoky> 30
02:42 < LoneSoldier728> oh ok, did you do ur time?
02:42 < shoky> 3 months :P
02:42 < LoneSoldier728> my dad did 5 yrs
02:42 < LoneSoldier728> he was born there i wasnt

02:43 < shoky> yup
02:43 < LoneSoldier728> anything exciting, you get a cut of waze? lol
02:44 < shoky> not too exciting lately. and no.. ;P i also heard that deal might not actualize due to monopoly shits
02:46 < LoneSoldier728> oh really
02:46 < LoneSoldier728> i tried to dcc u btw idk if thats how it works
02:46 < shoky> personally i'd hate to see how google shits all over a nice app
02:47 < shoky> no need for dcc you can just /msg or /query but i'm not available for a privchat now anyways sry
02:48 < LoneSoldier728> oh kk
02:48 < LoneSoldier728> ya waze is awesome
02:51 < LoneSoldier728> where is the rest of the 943 users from?
02:52  * ImBcmDth is trapped in New Jersey, USA
02:53 < LoneSoldier728> haha
02:53 < LoneSoldier728> you trying to leave NJ?
02:53 < briefcaseofguts> i think you want $(this)
02:53 < briefcaseofguts> but i dont know where your this.model
02:53 < briefcaseofguts> so probably not
02:53 < ImBcmDth> LoneSoldier728: yes!
02:53 < briefcaseofguts> just inspect this.model cuz it doesnt have that isvalid func
02:54 < LoneSoldier728> Well brief the isValid works when
02:54 < LoneSoldier728> I do not have the function surrounding it
02:54 < LoneSoldier728> can i dcc u
02:54 < briefcaseofguts> well the change is its own environment
02:54 < LoneSoldier728> is there an easier way to dcc?
02:54 < Guest34097> does anybody know Th0masR0ss?  which channel is he in?
02:54 < briefcaseofguts> with its own this
02:54 < LoneSoldier728> i keep going on the right
02:54 < LoneSoldier728> imbcmdth why dont u like it, which part of jers are u in
02:55 < briefcaseofguts> so the this in change() is a different this() its a jQuery obj now, so u need $(this), or you need to re-lookup your this obj, ie myapp.whatever.isValid()
02:55 < LoneSoldier728> I dcc u brief so i can show you the code without pasting 20 lines here
02:56 < briefcaseofguts> k
02:56 < LoneSoldier728> did you get it
02:56 < LoneSoldier728> or am I doing it wrong because I have yet to do a successful dcc
02:58 < briefcaseofguts> i dont know
02:58 < LoneSoldier728> can you try IMing me?
02:58 < briefcaseofguts> just go like this
02:59 < briefcaseofguts> mysuperelement = this
02:59 < briefcaseofguts> $('#something').change(function () { 
02:59 < briefcaseofguts> if (mysuperelement.model.isValid())
02:59 < LoneSoldier728> here I will paste it sorry people ahead of time lol
02:59 < briefcaseofguts> dostuff()
03:00 < LoneSoldier728> saveEdits: function () {
03:00 < LoneSoldier728>     		var form = $(this.el).find('form#updateUser');
03:00 < LoneSoldier728>     		this.model.set({
03:00 < LoneSoldier728>         		firstName : form.find('.firstName').val(),
03:00 < LoneSoldier728> 		        lastName : form.find('.lastName').val(),
03:00 < LoneSoldier728> 		        email: form.find('.email').val(),
03:00 < LoneSoldier728> 		        phone: form.find('.phone').val(),
03:00 < LoneSoldier728> 		        birthday: form.find('.birthday').val()
03:00 < LoneSoldier728>     	
03:00 < LoneSoldier728> 		   	}, {validate: true} );
03:00 < briefcaseofguts> b/c jquery reassigns this, as the init func is called.
03:00 < LoneSoldier728> var i = this.model;
03:00 < LoneSoldier728>     			$('.save').attr("disabled", "disabled");
03:00 < LoneSoldier728>     		
03:00 < LoneSoldier728>     			$('input').keyup(function() {
03:00 < LoneSoldier728>     				if(!i.isValid()) {
03:00 < LoneSoldier728>     				console.log('run');
03:00 < LoneSoldier728>     				$('.save').attr("disabled", "disabled");
03:00 < LoneSoldier728>     				} else {
03:00 < LoneSoldier728>     					console.log('run2');
03:00 < LoneSoldier728>     					alert('Changes have been made.')
03:00 < LoneSoldier728> I tried to use i
03:00 < LoneSoldier728> to get around it and that isnt working either
03:00 < LoneSoldier728> and originally i have .change
03:00 < briefcaseofguts> weird
03:01 < briefcaseofguts> you cant use var
03:01 < briefcaseofguts> well maybe u can
03:01 < briefcaseofguts> but if the keyup is triggered before that func is called its busto
03:01 < briefcaseofguts> i wouldnt use var, because it will be a global var
03:01 < LoneSoldier728> oh ok
03:01 < briefcaseofguts> and i would try something like if(i.isValid && i.isValid())
03:02 < LoneSoldier728> so it is part of a backbone view
03:02 < LoneSoldier728> which takes a model too
03:02 < briefcaseofguts> to make sure its set so javascript doesnt break the browser
03:02 < briefcaseofguts> but i dunno
03:02 < briefcaseofguts> you should set a breakpoint in keyup, and inspect the i object
03:02 < briefcaseofguts> and see if it has functions and stuff
03:03 < LoneSoldier728> the problem I have with the setup is
03:04 < LoneSoldier728> the attribute gets disabled
03:04 < LoneSoldier728> but then I cannot remove it
03:04 < LoneSoldier728> like it does not know that change is occuring
03:04 < briefcaseofguts> like to remove the actual disabled attribute?
03:04 < LoneSoldier728> ya
03:05 < briefcaseofguts> use .removeAttr('disabled') or .attr('disabled', null)
03:05 < LoneSoldier728> let me try the latter
03:06 < LoneSoldier728> hm nope, it seems to be still invalid even when I do have a valid
03:06 < LoneSoldier728> input
03:06 < LoneSoldier728> ok i got to do more surgery on it
03:08 < LoneSoldier728> ya im going to stackoverflow it
03:14 < LoneSoldier728> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17606925/backbone-validate-gurus-attention-please
03:14 < LoneSoldier728> brief check it out
03:17 < LoneSoldier728> So anyone else here from NY
03:20 < harumph> anyone have a recommendation for a book on node?
03:21 < xadillax> Help!
03:21 < xadillax> I'm a newbie of bash
03:21 < xadillax> anyone can help me to find the error?
03:21 < xadillax> thx
03:21 < xadillax> http://paste.ubuntu.com/5866944/
03:22 < Leo2> Hi guys
03:23 < dtudury> pascal is still a thing?
03:23 < Leo2> well this room is pretty deserted
03:23 < xadillax> emmm.. don't care about it
03:23 < xadillax> i mean the syntax err
03:23 < Leo2> can anybody recommend me a casual channel to talk about programming for beginners?
03:24 < dtudury> if there's no experts that answer right away I'll eventually verify your syntax error :)
03:24 < xadillax> @leo2, what do you mean about casual?
03:25 < carpii> anyone looking for a few hours node.js/jQuery work a week? Ive just listed a job on reddit.. http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/1i4ohp/hiring_experienced_nodejs_and_jquery_for_adhoc/ 
03:25 < xadillax> @dtudury, it says something like "nojsub.sh: 4: nojsub.sh: USERNAME: not found"
03:27 < briefcaseofguts> carpii y u no use angular
03:28 < carpii> is there a reason i should be other than personal pref?
03:28 < briefcaseofguts> yes: its not c#
03:28 < dtudury> based on almost no experience I think "a = 1" will not work when "a=1" will
03:28 < carpii> where does c# fit into it ?
03:29 < briefcaseofguts> just a random language, sry trolling hard today
03:29 < dtudury> (the first errors go away when I drop the extra spaces anyway)
03:29 < xadillax> so i couldn't use space?
03:29 < xadillax> emm... it's so urly
03:29 < dtudury> type it at your terminal
03:29 < carpii> ok well good effort :)
03:29 < dtudury> a = 1
03:29 < dtudury> then a=1
03:29 < briefcaseofguts> i know right
03:29 < carpii> yup
03:29 < dtudury> echo $a
03:29 < carpii> were you testing if i was just some braindead recruiter or something?
03:30 < xadillax> thx
03:30 < xadillax> it works
03:30 < briefcaseofguts> nah it was a real question, i imagined coding a whole app interface in jquery (again)
03:30 < briefcaseofguts> and threwup a little in my mouth
03:30 < carpii> hehe
03:30 < xadillax> but i think it's urly
03:30 < carpii> i dont mind jquery, i still remember the days where everything was done in vanilla js
03:30 < carpii> so i still feel kinda spoilt
03:31 < briefcaseofguts> agreed
03:31 < carpii> but even so, gui work is the devil :(
03:31 < briefcaseofguts> yea its way easier to fail at art than code in some sense
03:32 < briefcaseofguts> deviantart has the best ui crap on there
03:32 < briefcaseofguts> just hidden
03:32 < briefcaseofguts> and i dont think anyone uses it, i scroll through there in awe all the time
03:33 < carpii> heh yea
03:33 < carpii> im a software engineer and all my interfaces look like they were coded by an engineer :/
03:34 < briefcaseofguts> thats ok
03:34 < briefcaseofguts> my boss is a db admin, and i design interfaces he mocks up in ms word
03:34 < briefcaseofguts> so yea...
03:35 < briefcaseofguts> w/e at least ive never had to use any shadows, css, or rounded corners in 5 years
03:35 < briefcaseofguts> lol
03:52 -!- mode/#Node.js [+o TooTallNate] by ChanServ
04:01 < jmmy> with node, you don't use apache2, you use its own web server?
04:02 < mindcruzer> yeah, but usually you proxy through something like nginx in production
04:02 < jmmy> yeah, nginx or apache2 right?
04:02 < mindcruzer> .. or apache
04:02 < mindcruzer> yeah
04:03 < mindcruzer> but technically a node app _is_ a server, yes
04:03 < jmmy> so you use traditional webserver for hosting your page, and then you use node for the application functionalities
04:03 < carpii> it depends
04:04 < carpii> you *can* serve standard http from node.js too if you want too
04:04 < carpii> via express etc
04:04 < jmmy> carpii, yeah buy why would you?
04:04 < carpii> personally i dont like this setup, and would rather use node to serve as a socket server only
04:04 < carpii> i guess some people just like being able to deploy a website in node
04:04 < jmmy> carpii, exactly what I thought was the case
04:05 < carpii> but nothings is written in stone, if you dont want to serve http from node, theres no reason to
04:05 < dtudury> personally I've found writing a server in a language I already know well easier than maintaining apache (which I don't know well)
04:06 < carpii> and theres quite a few comercial websites serving from node, but given that fastcgi can serve up 20 concurrent pages compared to nodes one trhead, i dont see why you would either
04:06 < jmmy> carpii, see I'd like to buy bootstrap templates and then use node for the web apps stuff
04:06 < carpii> buy bootstrap templates?
04:06 < carpii> you mean html ones?
04:06 < jmmy> dtudury, whats to maintain, maybe some stuff to setup ssl, how would you do it in node?
04:07 < dtudury> depends on what you are using apache for
04:07 < dtudury> usually it's just serving files
04:07 < dtudury> which is a few dozen lines
04:08 < jmmy> carpii, yeah, you know, twitter bootstrap template for bootswatch or wrapbootstrap, or any html5/css3 template like on template monster or tons of other sites too
04:08 < dtudury> apache is fine though
04:08 < dtudury> when it works it's great
04:08 < dtudury> when you want to serve some special service in some special way you're in a rough spot (or at least I've been)
04:09 < jmmy> maybe I should wait a year or so until we get into node 1.0
04:09 < carpii> ah i see now
04:10 < jmmy> carpii, ready made front end design
04:10 < carpii> i prefer to use lighttpd for serving static files, but its a dying project so probably move to nginx at some point
04:10 < carpii> apache is probably great these days, but 1.3 wasnt up to the job for me, and so once bitten etc
04:10 < dtudury> the 1.x 2.x thing broke apache for me
04:10 < jmmy> carpii, whats wrong with apache2, not like I have a stake in the competetion between them, but out of curiosity
04:10 < dtudury> made it very hard to google for apache solutions
04:11 < carpii> nothing wrong that I know of, just I migrated and never looked back
04:11 < ningu> apache2 has plenty of docs
04:11 < jmmy> dtudury, I struggled a few years ago, but this year, when I tried again, everything worked very easily for me, subdomain, virtualhosts, ssl, all no problem
04:11 < carpii> when i migrated apache 2 was still quite young, and wasnt recommended for production
04:11 < dtudury> cool, good to hear
04:11 < ningu> apache2 has been fine for production for years 
04:12 < ningu> like, 5 years or something
04:12 < dtudury> I guess at the core node is fun, and everything else is just trying to justify it :)
04:12 < jmmy> ningu, yeah, I think way longer than that, I was just meaning about how easy it is configure
04:12 < carpii> yeah, i started my business in 2004 :)
04:12 < carpii> and if lighttpd had a problem, i woulda looked at apache 2 again, but i had no reason to, thats all i mean
04:12 < ningu> node is fun but it's based on a solution to a very real issue
04:13 < dtudury> yeah, yeah, didn't mean to short sell it
04:13 < jmmy> ningu, you can push data to the client, right?
04:13 < dtudury> I just mean my driving motivation for fighting for it
04:13 < ningu> jmmy: how to handle async operations efficiently
04:13 < ningu> pushing data to the client is a bonus
04:14 < jmmy> so what you guys saying about the development phase so far.  Still experimental, or ready for production?
04:14 < carpii> node ?
04:14 < ningu> the development phase?
04:14 < jmmy> carpii, yes
04:14 < dtudury> node is production
04:14 < jmmy> is it good to go?
04:14 < carpii> its already widely deployed
04:14 < jmmy> cool, so I'd better try to learn it eh
04:14 < ningu> if you mean node 0.11 then not ready for production
04:14 < carpii> just if you deploy it, there might be some things you need to rework as it progresses
04:14 < jmmy> I got it installed
04:14 < ningu> if you mean 0.10 then more than ready
04:14 < dtudury> 1.0 is very close and won't be very different
04:15 < jmmy> its gonna go from 0.1 to 1.0, what about 0.2, 0.3...?
04:15 < carpii> but most of us are here because we want to deploy node in production, not just because we want an academic exercise :p
04:15 < ningu> jmmy: 0.10, not 0.1
04:16 < jmmy> what the best book?
04:16 < dtudury> 0.11 is experimental if you want to play with something more rough but slightly closer to 1.0
04:16 < ningu> I wouldn't use a book
04:16 < jmmy> dtudury, no I want production and start showcasing to attract clients and get rich
04:16 < dtudury> but 0.10 is solid
04:16 < dtudury> jmmy :)
04:16 < jmmy> ningu, frig man, no book? c'mon, I got like three four of em
04:17 < carpii> books are no use if you dont just get your hands dirty and start coding 
04:17 < jmmy> dtudury, lol, right?
04:17 < ningu> jmmy: there are books, sure, I just think they aren't much help
04:17 < beardtree> Can someone recommend a rock-solid router?
04:17 < beardtree> jmmy: the bible, duh.
04:17 < ningu> haha
04:17 < dtudury> the docs are pretty good
04:17 < dtudury> node is actually pretty small
04:17 < ningu> beardtree: you mean a standalone module for url routing, or what?
04:18 < dtudury> it's as elegant as it is fun :)
04:18 < carpii> yeah its mostly conceptual thinking that is an obstacle to node development i think, rather than masses of apis you have to learn
04:18 < jmmy> I luv bible stories, don't understand em.  Dave built a nice pad for Queen Sheba and she relinquished her thrown.  So woman just need a nice home and they are happy?
04:18 < jmmy> beardtree, what bible?
04:19 < dtudury> vampire bible? (my…. wife…. loves true blood)
04:19 < ningu> jmmy: watch http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0pjVcIsU6A
04:19 < jmmy> I got jump_start_node, learning_node, node for php developers
04:19 < jmmy> ningu videos suck cause you cant skim though
04:20 < jmmy> I wish node was in jquery
04:20 < beardtree> ningu: hardware router. :)
04:20 < beardtree> jmmy: just kidding. :)
04:20 < carpii> jimmy, have you started writing a node project yet?
04:20 < jmmy> I feel like I should read elequent javascript first
04:20 < ningu> jmmy: that video is worth your time
04:20 < jmmy> carpii, ha, no just cracked open a three books
04:20 < jmmy> ningu, ok I am gonna check it out, be back later, thx guys
04:21 < dtudury> indeed, there is some knack to js (closures and scope) and some idiom to the community
04:21 < dtudury> don't think there's good books for either though
04:21 < jmmy> when you start using node, you have no need for php or any other server scripts?
04:22 < dtudury> js stem to stern :)
04:22 < dtudury> and/or php… ewe ;)
04:23 < jmmy> dtudury, I hear that about all programming languages on irc channels.  But you know sitepoint, I really find their books easy to learn.
04:24 < jmmy> I spent a lot of hours on php, and I am almost at the point where I can start making apps, but I just stopped last night and openned these node books.  So all that time is going in the trash
04:24 < ningu> knowledge of how to put together a web app is transferable
04:24 < jmmy> None of the php developing books take advantage of ajax
04:24 < jmmy> ningu, good, I hope so
04:24 < dtudury> jmmy, I don't, but I think the node community is a top feature.  you should transition from books to irc/twitter/github completely as soon as your comfortable
04:25 < ningu> dtudury: yes, I agree
04:25 < jmmy> dtudury, twitter?
04:25 <@mbalho> it means be a peer and not a disciple
04:25 < dtudury> jmmy, I know, right? they love it here :)
04:25 <@mbalho> write a node module today, its not too hard
04:25 < jmmy> I never got into twitter or github.  irc made me a computer guy as much as I am.  I owe to kind ppl on irc
04:26 < dtudury> oh, right and npm
04:27 < jmmy> Basically node is taking over and php, ruby, asp are going down the drain
04:27 < rom1504_> I don't think so
04:27 < dtudury> also node developers smell better
04:28 < jmmy> dtudury, i can't get anything out of twitter, dunno how it works, you gotta just follow people and they tell you I am having coffe at star bucks, I like this new technology, and had that epiphany...
04:28 < jmmy> rom1504_, why not?
04:28 < jmmy> rom1504_, its real time, anything less is garbage now
04:29 < rom1504_> I don't know why, it is just not happening
04:29 < dtudury> jimmy, yeah, the signal to noise is pretty high when you're following the node folks
04:29 < jmmy> req=request, and res=?
04:29 < rom1504_> that's like saying linux is taking over and windows and mac are going down the rain
04:29 < rom1504_> that'd be nice, but it's not happening
04:30 < dtudury> jmmy, sorry my mac keeps "
04:30 < dtudury> jmmy, "correcting" your name
04:30 < carpii> as a mac user, i can confirm osx IS going down the drain
04:30 < jmmy> I like to spell it like that cause then it almost the same forward and backwards, what the word for that?
04:31 < dtudury> anagram? maybe
04:31 < carpii> plaindrome ?
04:31 < carpii> palindrome ?
04:31 < jmmy> dtudury, no, carpii yeah, I think thats it
04:31 < rom1504_> really... even osx has a lot more users than (desktop) linux
04:31 < carpii> as in radar
04:31 < ningu> ugh, npm 1.3.3 is broken
04:31 < dtudury> my name is onomatopoeia, it is what I sound like
04:32 < carpii> yeah rom, i love linux as a server os, but as a desktop even after 10 years its pitiful
04:32 < LoneSoldier728> NY People shout yeaaaaah
04:32 < jmmy> Toronto in the houseeeee
04:32 < carpii> i used it for my main os until kde 4 came out, and 4.x was just a disaster
04:32 < LoneSoldier728> toronto is close to NYC
04:32 < carpii> i love how linux fans mock windows, but then the next release of kde copies vista entirely
04:32 < LoneSoldier728> in style
04:32 < jmmy> I use xfce 4, its like the windows xp of the linux world
04:33 < rom1504_> well I can't use windows for desktop anymore, too used for linux, never tried mac but it doesn't seem a lot better, it's very closed source and everything..
04:33 < rom1504_> *to
04:33 < jmmy> yeah, ubuntu copied Mac, and I hate the top file options to be separated from the window, I think they are best inside the application windows, that why I prefer windows or linux over mac.  But I love other things about mac, which you can setup linux to have using compiz
04:34 < LoneSoldier728> jimmy what do you do?
04:34 < dtudury> they're all dumb terminals now anyways, mine's just the most elite dumb terminal
04:34 < jmmy> LoneSoldier728, lots of masterbation
04:34 < carpii> rom, osx is nice because its consistent, all apps with same gui. but i find osx tries to be too simple and most apps lack all the config features youd want
04:34 < LoneSoldier728> nice, what is the code for that?
04:34 < carpii> and of course its all heading in the direction of a paid app store even for desktop apps
04:34 < LoneSoldier728> you using node js for the backend and headers from html?
04:35 < jmmy> LoneSoldier728, I am trying to be a webdesigner, but mostly, to be honest, I am just a stay at home single man
04:35 < LoneSoldier728> oh so your available thats good to know
04:35 < carpii> isnt that what a web designer is?
04:35 < jmmy> LoneSoldier728, available for what, yes I need money badly
04:35 < LoneSoldier728> so frontend stuff only?
04:36 < jmmy> LoneSoldier728, ok, I like twitter bootstrap, but I mostly use templates
04:36 < LoneSoldier728> oh twitter bootstrap is easy
04:36 < jmmy> LoneSoldier728, itsource.pw
04:36 < rom1504_> yeah the trouble with linux is its ui, windows and mac are better at it imho, probably because they are coming from big companies who have money to do design and everything
04:36 < LoneSoldier728> do you use any frameworks
04:36 < LoneSoldier728> for frontend js
04:36 < LoneSoldier728> ?
04:36 < rom1504_> but appart from that I prefer linux
04:37 < jmmy> LoneSoldier728, yeah, I quit learning front end once I found bootstrap, now I am trying to learn php and now node
04:37 < LoneSoldier728> yeah bootstrap makes it easy, how long have you been working with node
04:37 < jmmy> LoneSoldier728, what are you looking for
04:37 < LoneSoldier728> friends : /
04:38 < jmmy> LoneSoldier728, cool me too. I am just starting tonight.  Its been years, off and on as hobby I've been trying to learn php.  I've struggle, but I think I grasped it pretty good, and can make some server stuff now, but I am skipping applying my skills and going through the troubleshooting hell and jumping into node now
04:39 < LoneSoldier728> ya i heard to forget about php
04:40 < LoneSoldier728> send me an IM jimmy
04:40 < jmmy> LoneSoldier728, yeah, thats my best guess too, node rules now, cause of real time capabilites and listeners and stuff
04:45 < ningu> hmm
04:45 < ningu> what could make a .cache directory randomly appear? :P
05:03 < DiegoMax> o.o
05:06 < ayr_ton> everyone knows if theres a node.js app like pinax symposion? I'm trying to do one, but I don't if theres some working progress somewhere.
05:07 < ayr_ton> anyone*
05:08 < azbyin> are there any benchmarks of running node.js and compiled programs (c/c++/fortran/etc.) where the same functionality is implemented?
05:09 < ForSpareParts> I'm building an IRC app, figuring I'd use socket.io. Can anyone recommend a good frontend framework? There are a lot of choices, and I'm not sure what I want/need.
05:10 < ruby-lang605> Any freelance node.js developers available?
05:22 < othiym23> man, if only there were a nexxy in this channel
05:23 < ningu> othiym23: ?
05:24 < othiym23> I need a nexxy email address for reasons
05:24 < ningu> I see
05:26 < niggler> othiym23 have you considered the obvious?
05:27 < ningu> niggler: nexxy doesn't use email?
05:28 < niggler> there's a nonzero chance that you can find a person's email address by looking at their public commit history (bitbucket, github, etc)
05:29 < ningu> most chances are nonzero
05:29 < niggler> a nonzero number of chances are zero
05:30 < niggler> hence saying something is nonzero provides nonzero information
05:30 < ningu> in WWII the Japanese flew a nonzero number of zeros
05:31 < niggler> they also flew a nonzero number of nonzeros
05:36 < sorensen> lol
05:36 < sorensen> love the nonzeros
05:36 < ningu> I think they need to link github with grubhub
05:36  * sorensen has a nonzero chance of drinking more beer
05:37  * ningu is out of beer :(
05:37 < sorensen> :(
05:37  * sorensen should be
05:37 < ningu> hehe
05:37 < sorensen> pretty sure i'm already in trouble with the lady
05:37 < ningu> see if you linked grubhub with github you could just git pull it, or raise an issue
05:37 < sorensen> lol
05:37 < ningu> sorensen: with my gf it's kind of the other way around
05:38 < SomeoneWeird> ಠ_ಠ
05:38 < sorensen> how... i... cant compute
05:38 < sorensen> ಠ_ಠ
05:38 < sorensen> (╯°□°）╯ ︵ ┻━┻
05:38 < niggler> sorensen what if i told you that … ningu was the lady?
05:38 < ningu> haha
05:38 < sorensen> then you told me?
05:38 < ningu> not sure what the disapproval is, you've never been like... hmm that person is drinking too much? :P
05:38 < niggler> the heisenberg gender
05:39 < sorensen> i dont understand the point of the hypotheitcal
05:39 < ningu> sorensen: niggler has met me but he didn't check that closely
05:39 < sorensen> lol
05:39 < SomeoneWeird> ningu, he wants to
05:39 < niggler> there's a nonzero chance that ningu is male
05:39 < sorensen> my gf doesnt like it when i drink so much
05:39 < ningu> sorensen: but you've never decided someone else had too much?
05:40 < sorensen> well, back when i was in my teens perhaps
05:40 < sorensen> nowadays i'm in a foreign state and i know 2 people
05:40 < ningu> I don't mean like you too the drinks away
05:40 < ningu> but you were just like: hmm, this person is no longer that pleasant to be around
05:40 < ningu> took*
05:41 < sorensen> its interesting, its really just me and the gf
05:41 < ningu> ah well
05:41 < sorensen> so primarly its just me :
05:41 < ningu> what foreign state?
05:41 < sorensen> :\
05:41 < sorensen> washington
05:41 < sorensen> i'm from nebraska
05:41 < niggler> tragic that there's no "nonzero beer"
05:41 < ningu> oh *that* kind of foreign state
05:42 < sorensen> lol yes
05:42 < altusllc> most of my restful modules don't export the functions they use for handling routes, so how would i unit-test that?
05:42 < sorensen> foreign / new
05:43 < ningu> sorensen: my former long-term lady ran off with a guy from nebraska :P
05:45 < mscdex> those nebraskans are missing out on Windows 1.0
05:45 < ningu> niggler: would that be like 0.1% alcohol content?
05:45 < ningu> or something else?
05:45 < sorensen> dam nebraskans
05:45 < ningu> well they left the bay area and went back to nebraska for some reason
05:45 < sorensen> strange
05:46 < ningu> $ I think
05:46 < sorensen> biggest city in nebraska is only 1.6 million
05:46 < ningu> sorensen: SF is half that size
05:46 < sorensen> lol
05:46 < sorensen> you cray
05:46 < sorensen> ;)
05:46 < ningu> no, I am not
05:46 < ningu> SF is under a million
05:46 < ningu> San Jose has a larger population
05:46 < sorensen> you are correct
05:47 < sorensen> never knew
05:47 < sorensen> omaha is bigger than manhattan...
05:47 < sorensen> well...
05:47 < sorensen> hard to really say
05:47 < sorensen> considered a *metropolitan area*
05:47 < sorensen> cities are divided by a single street
05:48 < sorensen> but are all contiguous
05:48 < ningu> in manhattan they just have a metropolitan opera
05:48 < sorensen> lol
05:48 < sorensen> i dont miss manhattan
05:49 < briefcaseofguts> my ex was a total whore
05:49 < briefcaseofguts> fml
05:50 < ningu> is fml a variant of xml?
05:50 < sorensen> ಠ_ಠ
05:50 < sorensen> not appropriate
05:50 < sorensen> for the channel
05:51 < sorensen> want appropriate? electronic/dubsteps!!! http://open.spotify.com/user/beausorensen/playlist/3lQalkEDf7vLsrNP8G7Vzr
05:51 < sorensen> :D
05:51 < niggler> sorensen which part was not appropriate?  xml or fml or something else?
05:52 < sorensen> total whore
05:52 < sorensen> lol
05:52 < sorensen> or xml
05:52 < sorensen> never appropriate
05:52 < sorensen> :P
05:52 < ningu> xml is a total whore
05:52 < sorensen> acceptable
05:53 < ningu> ... but at least it uses UTF-8
05:53  * sorensen cant think of a mom joke for that
05:53 < sorensen> dam...
05:53 < sorensen> its too late
05:53 < niggler> oh come on sorensen 
05:53 < ningu> sorensen: ... she only consists of wide characters?
05:53 < sorensen> dude... i'm sorry
05:53 < sorensen> i just.. its late...
05:53 < niggler> "she does utf-8?  mine only does ascii"
05:54 < niggler> or something like that
05:54 < ningu> she doesn't even fit in the basic multilingual plane?
05:54 < sorensen> no no, ningu won the rounjd
05:54 < sorensen> oh dam stop
05:54 < niggler> haha ningu 
05:54 < niggler> ++ ningu 
05:54 < sorensen> i have beer up my nose from the first one
05:54 < sorensen> well done
05:54 < sorensen> (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ
05:55  * sorensen (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞
05:55 < ningu> sorensen: did you know the look of disapproval comes from Kannada?
05:56 < sorensen> i have no idea what kannada is
05:56 < ningu> a south indian language
05:57 < ningu> actually I meant from Kannada script
05:57 < sorensen> interesting
05:57 < sorensen> yes, the script
05:57 < sorensen> i assumed
05:58 < sorensen> i love how off topic we get
05:59 < ningu> niggler: you still haven't said what kind of a brew nonzero beer would be
06:01 < jmmy> none of this make any sense to me, but I am getting error: module.js:340 throw err; Error: Cannot find module 'mongoose'
06:01 < ningu> jmmy: perhaps you didn't install mongoose
06:01 < ningu> npm install mongoose
06:02 < jmmy> ningu, wow, that was it
06:03 < sorensen> :D
06:03 < TehShrike> no u
06:03 < sorensen> love the easy fixes
06:03 < pplcf> how to make synchronous error tolerant function queue?
06:03 < TehShrike> with an array?
06:03 < sorensen> i wish all my problems could be solved with `npm install`
06:03 < sorensen> :(
06:03 < leichtgewicht> Wouldn't be error messages like Error: Cannot find module 'mongoose'. Is it installed? Maybe this helps: npm install mongoose
06:04 < TehShrike> npm install love
06:04 < leichtgewicht> awesome?
06:04 < sorensen> leichtgewicht: problem already solved ;)
06:04 < pplcf> I have cron module wich does some tasks
06:04 < pplcf> but if one task somehow fails
06:04 < pplcf> whole app dies
06:04 < leichtgewicht> Well: i mean generally. If nodejs would give that sort of help.
06:05 < sorensen> pplcf: i dont quite understand the issue
06:05 < sorensen> if its synchronous you can use try/catch
06:05 < leichtgewicht> instead of a generic "Cannot find module" something more specific like "How about ... "
06:05 < sorensen> its not node's job
06:06 < sorensen> python doesnt tell me how to deal with pip
06:06 < sorensen> nor does node.js tell me about npm
06:06 < TehShrike> oh man
06:06 < TehShrike> please forgive this next horrible comment
06:06 < sorensen> package managers are replacable and can iterate much faster
06:06 < sorensen> not the job of the language in any way
06:06 < TehShrike> But I feel like the most appropriate immature comment to follow that one is "your mom doesn't tell me how to use a condom"
06:06 < sorensen> just my opinion
06:07 < sorensen> TehShrike: bad comment and not very funny
06:07 < sorensen> :P
06:07 < sorensen> mainly just not funny
06:07 < sorensen> to which i am the sadz
06:07 < TehShrike> sorensen: you are correct on both counts, and I apologize, yet I still could not resist
06:07  * TehShrike blames the beer
06:07  * sorensen blames tgh berreer
06:08 < TehShrike> DON"T BLAME TEH BEERZ WHAT DID IT EVAR DO TO YOU
06:08 < pplcf> <sorensen> http://pastebin.com/WNpsVsKf
06:09 < pplcf> maybe I don't quite understand how try catch works in js
06:09 < sorensen> wiat no
06:09 < sorensen> thats not async at all
06:09 < sorensen> err, sync
06:09 < TehShrike> Where does the func come from?
06:09 < sorensen> its very much async
06:09 < pplcf> crap
06:10 < sorensen> besides of the issue of 'why the closure'
06:10 < sorensen>  if (err) throw err
06:10 < sorensen> if (err) this.emit('error', err)
06:10 < Guest88292> I need a module to transfer objects between two servers. What you guys recommend?
06:10 < mscdex> try { beer(); } catch (drunks) {}
06:11 < zomg> Bah, why does it look like there are next to no good ways to use phantomjs from node to do browser testing..
06:11 < sorensen> i thought phanton was only for scraping?
06:11 < sorensen> :P
06:11 < TehShrike> Guest88292: dnode?
06:11 < sorensen> Guest88292: not dnode?
06:11 < TehShrike> mscdex: throw "TehShrike"
06:12 < zomg> sorensen: it can be used as a headless browser for testing too
06:12 < sorensen> i know, was a joke
06:12 < zomg> hehe
06:12 < sorensen> :P
06:12 < zomg> used it in a rails project and it worked really well so now I'm trying to see if there's any libs for node to do the same
06:12 < zomg> and... nope
06:12 < zomg> well, there are some but they all seem kinda.. experimental, or crap
06:12 < zomg> =)
06:12 < sorensen> Guest88292: one of the ways we've done it many times is using a pub sub system
06:12 < sorensen> either with redis or zeroMQ or rabitMQ
06:13 < mscdex> hareMQ
06:13 < sorensen> which so far has worked fantastic for us, since it doesnt care about the language or app that is pushing / reading the queue
06:13 < sorensen> very agnostic
06:13 < sorensen> we had a .net app push into the queue, a node app read it, then push into a python app
06:14 < TehShrike> oh, unrelated
06:14 < sorensen> ftw
06:14 < TehShrike> but sqs is awesome
06:14 < TehShrike> seriously
06:14 < mscdex> don't cross the streams!
06:14 < TehShrike> A system-agnostic work queue
06:14 < sorensen> mscdex: brb, gotta cross... not the streams
06:14 < sorensen> LOOK AWAY
06:15 < TehShrike> It makes some parts of life so easy
06:15 < mscdex> :O
06:15 < sorensen> also: sqs?
06:15 < pplcf> I still don't get why whole app dies when 'popped' function fails
06:15 < TehShrike> sorensen: Amazon Simple Queue Service
06:15 < sorensen> because you likely raised a JS error and did not handle it
06:15 < sorensen> in which case the app exits
06:15 < sorensen> most similar to how most every other language exits
06:15 < sorensen> when an error occurs
06:16 < mscdex> >> raise "A good question";
06:16 < purr> mscdex: SyntaxError: Unexpected string
06:16 < jmmy> this syntax is totally unfamiliar to me
06:16 < mscdex> how dare you give me a syntax error purr!
06:16 < sorensen> jmmy: thats a good thing! :D
06:16 < sorensen> i feel the same about lua
06:16 < TehShrike> Main difference is, in other languages, the error doesn't shut down the whole server, just the current connection
06:16 < TehShrike> I need to work with lua, I keep hearing tantalizing things
06:17 < sorensen> lol
06:17 < sorensen> well
06:17 < pplcf> so why we even have 'try catch' then? only for manually raised exceptions like throw 'err'?
06:17 < sorensen> in other languages
06:17 < sorensen> current connection== process
06:17 < sorensen> server == nginx / apache
06:17 <@konobi> need to find an excuse to play with manta i reckons
06:17 < sorensen> very different paradigm
