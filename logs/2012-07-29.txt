00:21 < mattkelly> having issues with felixge's mysql module-- "Error: getaddrinfo ENOENT"
00:22 < Tobsn> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9580226/nodejs-httprequest-with-data-getting-error-getaddrinfo-enoent
00:22 < Tobsn> you sure you using it right?
00:22 < mattkelly> I believe so-- I've Googled a bit, too
00:22 < mattkelly> I'm using localhost, 3306
00:24 < mattkelly> var mysql      = require('mysql'); var connection = mysql.createConnection({user     : '*****',password : '*****',database : '****',}); connection.connect();
00:24 < mattkelly> it dies on connection.connect();
00:27 < joeandaverde> clearing an array by setting length to zero?. does that seem bad or an efficient use of javascript?
00:31 < mattkelly> Tobsn: any thoughts?  The stackoverflow post doesn't seem to be relevant, since I'm using localhost.
00:32 < Tobsn> hmm nah no idea i dont use mysql sorry
00:32 < Tobsn> just making sure you actually check if youre doing it right :P
00:32 < Tobsn> (mostly the problem)
00:32 < mattkelly> yeah, I believe so :\
00:33 < mattkelly> thanks though
00:34 < timeturne> function MyStream() { EventEmitter.call(this) }; util.inherits(MyStream, EventEmitter) == MyStream.prototype.__proto__ = EventEmiter.prototype ?
00:36 < joeandaverde> you should use paste bin for that? makes it much easier to read
00:36 < joeandaverde> or a gist
00:41 <@deoxxa> joeandaverde: that won't work (setting length to 0)
00:42 <@deoxxa> joeandaverde: since you'll still have the references to various things at arr[0], arr[1], etc
00:42 <@deoxxa> the length property only affects how the push/pop/etc functions work
00:44 < owen1> i am writing a proxy that saves the content of a request to redis. when a request is made to google.com, i actualy see a few requests. one of them is to http://images/srpr/nav_logo80.png.  and i get ENOTFOUND. any idea whyL
00:45 < owen1> ?
00:49 < SnakePlissken> so having a tough time understanding routes...can anyone explain why is so hard to find information on simply including .css and .js files in my index.html file?
00:49 <@jhizzle> because it's a different problem? Look for a static fileserver component for whatever framework you're using
00:50 < shanse> including js and css in your index.html isnt really node related
00:50 <@deoxxa> SnakePlissken: you're using a framework. tell us what framework. then we'll tell you to ask the people in charge of that framework.
00:50 < SnakePlissken> express
00:50  * deoxxa points to #express
00:50 <@jhizzle> SnakePlissken: express static middleware.
00:50 < SnakePlissken> thanks for answering so quick
00:51 <@jhizzle> deoxxa: Was it you I was talking about rtorrent bindings about the other day?
00:51 <@deoxxa> jhizzle: perhaps!
00:51 <@jhizzle> deoxxa: I ended up writing bindings for vlc's http api instead
00:51 <@deoxxa> vlc... does torrents?
00:51 <@jhizzle> no, but it DOES have an http api!
00:51 <@jhizzle> haha
00:51 <@deoxxa> haha
00:51 <@jhizzle> and a pretty lame one at that
00:51 <@jhizzle> Their scripting layer is in lua which is neat
00:52 <@jhizzle> but then they wrote it like it was php
00:52 <@deoxxa> yeah
00:52 <@jhizzle> total spaghetti code imo
00:52 <@deoxxa> the vlc guys are known for that
00:52 <@jhizzle> the whole API is gets with querystrings
00:52 <@deoxxa> i'm just glad the x264 guys haven't caved to them
00:52 <@deoxxa> x264 is a piece of art
00:52 <@deoxxa> and a damn fast piece of art at that
00:53 <@jhizzle> caved? What do you mean?
00:53 <@jhizzle> http://repo.or.cz/w/vlc.git/blob/HEAD:/share/lua/http/requests/README.txt This is the "documentation" for the api
00:53 <@jhizzle> https://github.com/jesusabdullah/node-vlc-api Here's the client itself :)
00:53 <@deoxxa> the x264 and vlc teams are doing a lot of mixing these days
00:53 <@deoxxa> i like it how they call it a "page"
00:55 <@jhizzle> lol yeah
00:55 <@jhizzle> and all the "requests" page code looks like
00:55 <@jhizzle> <?vlc
00:55 < snrmwg> need in my gyp build a step to generate some sources (c++, headers,...) and want to access them in another step, already defined the generation target but can't access the files from 'main' sources
00:55 <@jhizzle>   # lua code here
00:55 <@jhizzle> ?>
00:55 <@deoxxa> lolll
00:55 <@jhizzle> yeah they seriously reinvented that part of php
00:56 <@jhizzle> and then it's next to impossible to figure out where all the disparate chunks of code are actually coming from
00:56 <@Chepra> "NOTA BENE: pl_delete is completly UNSUPPORTED" <3
00:56 <@jhizzle> ruby-style "dump everything into the current namespace" type stuff
00:56 <@jhizzle> Chepra: Hell yeah
00:56 <@deoxxa> i kind of put vlc in the same pile as openssl
00:56 <@Chepra> they should write a decent videoplayer, not http-apis :D
00:56 <@deoxxa> awesome tool, really shitty library
00:56 <@jhizzle> Chepra: https://github.com/jesusabdullah/node-vlc-api/blob/master/index.js#L100
00:57 < _Tristan> op plz
00:57 <@_Tristan> thanky
00:57 <@_Tristan> now, there's a fucking problem.
00:58 <@deoxxa> what problem
00:58 <@_Tristan> http://pastebin.com/5eWBPf7N am I high, or is this supposed to work?
00:58 <@deoxxa> that's how it works, yes
00:58 <@Nexxy> yes
00:58 <@Nexxy> lol
00:58 <@_Tristan> well shit
00:58 <@jhizzle> How's it not working?
00:58 <@Nexxy> but that doesn't necessarily rule out the possibility of you being high
00:58 <@deoxxa> ^^ this
00:58 <@jhizzle> Are you actually **using** the socket.io's?
00:58 <@_Tristan> Cannot GET /socket.io/socket.io.js
00:59 <@_Tristan> it works in ~/Documents/ideas/thingy/test.js but not /var/www/test/test.js
00:59 <@jhizzle> sounds like you're hitting the wrong endpoint.
00:59 <@deoxxa> i'm not even going to pretend i know what your setup is
00:59 <@_Tristan> my setup isn't complicated
01:00 <@_Tristan> I just use ~/Documents/ideas for crazy ideas, and /var/www/test for testing things
01:00 <@jhizzle> setups are inherently complex
01:00 <@_Tristan> it's just stock ubuntu 12.04
01:01 <@_Tristan> I didn't do anything crazy with it
01:01 <@_Tristan> and I obviously didn't change the endpoint
01:02 <@Nexxy> _Tristan, it might help to show your client-side code
01:03 <@_Tristan> there is no client side code, I just went to localhost:14922/socket.io/socket.io.js
01:13 < myndzi> lolwut
01:13 < myndzi> suddenly ops
01:14 <@_Tristan> it's a problem affecting all of socket.io 3.0.0
01:14 < myndzi> does anybody know of a light websocket-based chat? preferably using sockjs
01:14 < myndzi> a socket.io is fine too ;p
01:16 <@_Tristan> I'd recommend making one yourself
01:16 <@_Tristan> it's easy
01:17 < blazes816> anyone here use sublime text 2 and know of a plugin to get a terminal window in a pane or something?  I can't find anything that does that.
01:20 < myndzi> i know it's easy, and i'd like to make one myself, but for this use i'd rather something that's already written and tested since i'd need it pretty soon
01:22 < myndzi> looks like everything's either a really simple demo or some express thing, ah well
01:23 < blazes816> myndzi: have you checked out https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Projects,-Applications,-and-Companies-Using-Node ?
01:23 < blazes816> ctrl-Fing reveals quite a few
01:23 < myndzi> didn't think to look at that list
01:23 < blazes816> for 'chat'
01:23 < myndzi> i'll give it a run
01:23 < blazes816> me either, but after performing a simple Google search it came to my attention.
01:23 < blazes816> this google is the future
01:25 < myndzi> "this google"?
01:25 < myndzi> google has been getting worse lately
01:26 < blazes816> how so?  results?  speed?
01:26 < blazes816> morals?
01:27 < myndzi> results
01:27 < myndzi> (quality)
01:27 < myndzi> particularly with penguin, they pretty much just slapped a bunch of webmasters down for shady links
01:27 < myndzi> it wasn't a search quality enhancemetn
01:27 < blazes816> i haven't had any issues, but I don't search much outside my 'bubble'
01:27 < myndzi> enhancement*
01:27 <@CIA-93> libuv: Ben Noordhuis master * rbe10324 / (17 files in 5 dirs): Merge branch 'v0.8' (+24 more commits...) - http://git.io/MJxd1w
01:28 < myndzi> i've been noticing more lame sites in my search results
01:28 < myndzi> particularly with programming searches 
01:28 < blazes816> >98% of my search go to github, or some documentation.  and should.
01:28 < blazes816> so i can't really relate
01:29 < blazes816> i don't often search like "what to do if i'm having a pregnant"
01:29 < myndzi> ha.
01:29 < myndzi> i wish they'd bring back the block sites function
01:29 < myndzi> i'd really like to block w3schools
01:30 < blazes816> yeah, that would be nice
01:32 <@_Tristan> why do people hate w3schools so much?
01:33 < blazes816> idk, i was only talking about the blocking
01:33 < blazes816> it's not bad
01:33 < blazes816> other than the certificate scam
01:33 < blazes816> but if people fall for it
01:34 <@_Tristan> people fall for that?
01:35 <@_Tristan> I guess it's a steal compared to college. Much less money for a piece of paper of equal value...
01:36 < blazes816> haha, true
01:36 <@jhizzle> w3schools is just really low quality
01:36 < blazes816> i just got over falling for that scam myself
01:36 < myndzi> why do i hate w3schools?
01:36 < blazes816> (college, not w3s)
01:36 <@jhizzle> My college experience was good
01:36 < myndzi> because it ranks for everything i want to look up with the bare minimum information that's not detailed enough to be particularly useful
01:36 <@jhizzle> that said I'm not working in the field I trained for
01:36 < myndzi> i'd much rather see mdn
01:37 <@jhizzle> then again I could've if I wanted to
01:38 <@_Tristan> I remember all the complicated stuff, but I forget out to spell substr 5-6 times per day
01:39 <@_Tristan> jhizzle: your w3 certificate experience might be good as well - that wouldn't make it any less of a scam :P
01:44 < prettyrobots>  /server
01:47 <@jhizzle> _Tristan: I went to engineering school though. It was actually a pretty good bargain between scholarships and all the shit I learned
01:47 <@_Tristan> scholarships :>
01:47 <@jhizzle> I also lucked out and had a very good advisor
01:47 <@_Tristan> if I had scholarships I might have gone to college
01:49 < blazes816> my school was horrible.  I wrote a letter to the dean of the engineering college and dropped out
01:49 <@jhizzle> My department was pretty small.
01:49 <@jhizzle> I knew all the faculty on pretty much a first name basis
01:49 <@jhizzle> they didn't all like that though
01:50 < blazes816>  lol
01:50 <@jhizzle> y'know, you become a full professor and you don't always like kids calling you "Jonah"
01:50 < TheProfessor> KEEP CALLING ME JONAH AND I'LL START CALLING YOU THE WHALE
01:50 < blazes816> i couldn't have managed to say "armarnath" at 8 am on monday mornings with a hight accuracy
01:51 < blazes816> did Jonah not get destroyed by the whale?
01:58 < moxie> op plz
02:28 < prettyrobots> I'm going to be able to spend more time with everyone here now; I've just setup ZNC.
02:28 < prettyrobots> IRC am amazering.
03:14 <@munro> is it possible to set a folder as a dependency?  I would like to have part of my application look like an external dependency while I build it
03:16 <@munro> I've done `ln -s ../bar node_modules/bar` before, but it's kind of annoying because I have `node_modules` in my .gitignore
03:30 < arinel> hi guys! is there a way to register an error handler for a mounted sub app? (mounted with app.use() )
03:31 < arinel> I'd better ask this in #express 
03:36 < owen1> what day/time in NodeUp being aired?
03:36 < owen1> in=is
03:45 <@TehShrike> owen1: tomorrow, apparently - not sure what time
03:54 < owen1> TehShrike: thanks. if you ever know the time, you guys should put it on the site.
03:55 <@TehShrike> Do they usually stream it?  Or just put the mp3 up after they're done with the conversationing?
03:55 < owen1> TehShrike: i thought u'r one of them..
03:55 <@TehShrike> Oh, nope.
03:56 <@TehShrike> Maybe someday :-)
03:56 < owen1> i think it's streamed. there is also an irc channel. can't remember the name. maybe #nodeup ?
03:57 < owen1> yeah. nodeup has 28 nicks now
03:58 <@TehShrike> aah cool
04:06 < owen1> 29
04:14 <@deoxxa> ok, process monitoring.
04:15 <@deoxxa> i'm torn between making something that hooks itself to a directory and keeps track of PIDs etc, or making some big global supervisor thing
04:23 < diverdude> when i use node-mysql and do a query i do: mysqlclient.query('SELECT ...',function(err, results, fields){}); so if i need to do a series of mysql operations, is this really the way to do it? mysqlclient.query('SELECT ...',function(err, results, fields){mysqlclient.query('SELECT ...',function(err, results, fields){mysqlclient.query('SELECT ...',function(err, results, fields){mysqlclient.query('SELECT ...',function(err, results, fields){...and so
04:23 < diverdude>  on....})})})}); ? i find it a bit strange with this nesting structure
04:24 <@deoxxa> diverdude: http://callbackhell.com/ and https://github.com/caolan/async
04:25 <@deoxxa> you're looking for async.series or async.waterfall, depending on what you're doing
04:25 < owen1> deoxxa: stupid question. are u passing STDOUT=log_file in produciton?
04:25 <@TehShrike> diverdude: there's also other stuff, though async seems the most popular https://github.com/creationix/step
04:25 <@deoxxa> owen1: i have no idea what you're talking about
04:25 < owen1> deoxxa: oh
04:26 < owen1> deoxxa: i am curious if you use an error log file and stdout log file for production apps
04:27 < owen1> and if you do, is it done by passing STDOUT to the node process?
04:27 <@deoxxa> owen1: oh, i use winston and log to a file right now - that will eventually be moved to logging in a central database
04:28 < owen1> deoxxa: ok. thanks. i wonder if there is a reason to use external module instead of console.log
04:28 <@deoxxa> owen1: winston has a bunch of cool transports, and some neat convenience functions (logger.info, logger.error, etc)
04:28 < owen1> deoxxa: you got those in node core as well
04:29 < owen1> http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/stdio.html
04:29 <@deoxxa> oh cool, i didn't know about them
04:29 <@deoxxa> i knew about .log and .warn
04:30 <@deoxxa> but yeah, see https://github.com/flatiron/winston/ - what i'm going to have set up is a few different levels of logging
04:30 < owen1> the question is if there is an environment variable i can pass like STDOUT=file. i guess i'll just try it.
04:30 < owen1> and STDERR
04:30 <@TehShrike> Wouldn't the traditional method just involve piping it on the command-line?
04:31 <@deoxxa> TehShrike: yep
04:31 < owen1> TehShrike: i guesss, but not sure if STDOUT/STDERR exist
04:31 < owen1> unless it's a universal unix thingp
04:31 <@deoxxa> but i want to have errors sent to an email
04:31 < owen1> thingy
04:31 <@deoxxa> owen1: i don't think it works that way
04:32 < diverdude> deoxxa: hmm so it is true that i need to do this callback nesting....the article basically just tells me to make it less ugly
04:33 <@deoxxa> diverdude: yep
04:33 < owen1> diverdude: which one? callbackhell.com ?
04:33 <@deoxxa> diverdude: but there are a bunch of cool libraries out there that make it much less ugly
04:33 < diverdude> owen1: yeah
04:33 < prettyrobots> I created a new one of those.
04:33 < owen1> diverdude: i like this approach.
04:34 < diverdude> owen1: the callbackhell.com approach?
04:34 < prettyrobots> It's easier to deal with callbacks when you get used to programming in functions.
04:34 < owen1> diverdude: yeah. i like it.
04:34 < prettyrobots> Working on an async control flow library: https://github.com/bigeasy/cadence
04:34 < owen1> i don't like to hide the async with something that looks like a blocking code.
04:35 < prettyrobots> owen1: I agree. I'd much rather think about what's actually going on.
04:36 <@Nexxy> naysayer!
04:36 <@Nexxy> promises are teh future
04:36 < prettyrobots> Nexxy: Really?
04:36 < owen1> Nexxy: i hope not (
04:36 <@Nexxy> sorry I can't do it, it's too funny
04:36 <@Nexxy> lolol
04:36 < owen1> prettyrobots: she's trolling u
04:36 < prettyrobots> I'm honored.
04:36 <@deoxxa> promises are scary
04:36 < prettyrobots> And apoplectic.
04:37 <@Nexxy> oohh 10 pts
04:37 < prettyrobots> Promises make me blood boil!
04:37 <@deoxxa> DOUBLE WORD SCORE
04:37 <@Nexxy> robots don't have blood!
04:37 <@deoxxa> i haven't played scrabble in years
04:37 < prettyrobots> Promises are the future. Oh, I see what you did there.
04:38 <@deoxxa> Nexxy: he would have said oil, but then alliteration etc
04:38 <@Nexxy> ;)
04:38 <@deoxxa> (assuming he, here)
04:38 <@Nexxy> bad form!
04:38 < prettyrobots> Yup.
04:38 <@Nexxy> robots are genderless!
04:38 <@deoxxa> default form!
04:38 <@deoxxa> ah true
04:38 <@deoxxa> "it"
04:38 <@Nexxy> "they"
04:38 < prettyrobots> Yo.
04:38 <@Nexxy> YO!
04:38 <@Nexxy> i'm from chicago
04:39 < prettyrobots> Yo a robot.
04:39 <@deoxxa> 88.9
04:39 <@Nexxy> deoxxa, yo need to settle
04:40 <@deoxxa> damn, why is that in my head
04:40 < prettyrobots> So, for control flow, I've used the array of functions, but created an implicit context.
04:40  * Nexxy golf clap
04:41 < prettyrobots> So, that your callback values get kept around, in case you need them again.
04:41 < prettyrobots> Which you often do. And then they get disposed when the functions are done.
04:41 < diverdude> hmm so https://github.com/caolan/async is the most used callback library?
04:41 < prettyrobots> Also, I'm using function names to do branching, which is a bunch of fun.
04:41 < prettyrobots> diverdude: That or Step.
04:42 <@Nexxy> or arrays
04:42 <@Nexxy> prettyrobots, link?
04:42 <@Nexxy> oh
04:42 < owen1> prettyrobots: yeah. async is the most used. but try not to use any if you can.
04:43 < prettyrobots> Heh.
04:43 < timeturne> if a and b are functions what is the difference between a.prototype.__proto__ = b.prototype; and a.prototype = b.prototype; ?
04:44 <@Nexxy> flow control: not even once.
04:44 < prettyrobots> Need some real world examples, which I'm creating as i use it.
04:44 < prettyrobots> https://github.com/bigeasy/cadence/blob/master/t/cadence/jump.t
04:44 < Zamarok> best way to check if a file exists?
04:44 < prettyrobots> flow control?
04:44 < Zamarok> async
04:44 <@Nexxy> control flow*
04:44 <@Nexxy> my bad
04:45 < prettyrobots> Stacked context: https://github.com/bigeasy/cadence/blob/master/t/cadence/stack.t
04:45 < prettyrobots> Anyway, Nexxy what is not even once?
04:45 < prettyrobots> Zamarok: http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_exists_path_callback
04:46 <@Nexxy> prettyrobots, it's not worth explaining :P
04:46 < prettyrobots> Roger that.
04:48 < Zamarok> thanks
04:49 < cxreg> not sure if this is useful to anyone in here, but i use it with a lot of my programming projects.  a library to "localize" your environment variables and shell aliases to a directory:  http://smartcd.org
04:49 < cxreg> i often make a "restart" alias for all my projects, this lets them not conflict
04:50 < Zamarok> prettyrobots: how about to check if a folder exists?
04:50 < prettyrobots> Same? Maybe you want to stat it, see if it is actually a folder.
04:50 < prettyrobots> fs.stat
04:53 < diverdude> owen1: so best is to not use a callback lib?
04:53 < prettyrobots> diverdude: You can get a lot done by just naming your next step, giving a function a name, and calling that.
04:54 < prettyrobots> Like so:
04:54 < prettyrobots> https://github.com/bigeasy/strata/blob/master/index.js#L901
04:55 < prettyrobots> The steps are named functions in the larger function.
05:05 < owen1> diverdude: yeah. that's the best approach and u'll heard it from the node core guys.
05:06 < owen1> callbacks, just like you, are awesome and it's a matter of getting used to them.
05:54 <@ryah> saturday night 718 people in #node.js
05:54 <@ryah> i think we've captured the nerd population
05:55 < Darkout> haha
05:55 < Darkout> maybe they are working or just zombies :P
05:56 <@jhizzle> Yeah maybe
05:56 <@jhizzle> oh shit it's almost 11
05:56 <@jhizzle> I'd better get busy if I want to get my drink on
05:56 < Darkout> 11? where are you?
05:56 <@ryah> yes
05:56 <@ryah> im just about to leave :)
05:56 < Darkout> here is 2am
05:56 < Darkout> NY
05:57 <@ryah> west coast \m/
05:57 < Darkout> yeah… lucky! 
05:57 < Darkout> CA?
05:57 < gkatsev> Darkout: not 2am yet!
05:58 <@ryah> Darkout: yeah sf
05:58 <@ryah> the city of hackers
05:58 < Darkout> gkatsev: almost there :D
05:58 < gkatsev> I'm in Boston, though
06:00 <@jhizzle> https://github.com/jesusabdullah/vlcli
06:00 <@jhizzle> Totally works
06:01 <@ryah> jhizzle: what's that for?
06:01 < Darkout> cool
06:01 < gkatsev> vlc http cli
06:01 <@ryah> oops gtg later
06:03 < milani> jhizzle, vlc has cvlc I think which is CLI tools for vlc
06:21 <@jhizzle> milani: Yes it does, but it's a different style
06:21 <@jhizzle> milani: This one hits the http api, the cli tool is a repl
06:22 <@jhizzle> milani: Did you know the interfaces in vlc are scripted with lua?
06:23 < milani> jhizzle, no I didn't. cvlc is not repl is it?
06:24 <@jhizzle> milani: It is indeed. Try it out! vlc -I cli
06:24 <@jhizzle> milani: There's also an ncurses interface, it's not as good
06:25 < milani> jhizzle, run cvlc --help
06:25 < milani> and you see that its not a repl.
06:26 < milani> it is a cli tools. anyway, thx:)
06:26 <@jhizzle> milani: Try running just "cvlc"
06:26 <@jhizzle> milani: I used it for at least a month, it's a repl
06:26 <@jhizzle> milani: I can even show you the code.
06:26 < milani> oh. I run cvlc can I run commands now?
06:28 <@jhizzle> yeah, try "pause"
06:28 <@jhizzle> and "resume"
06:31 < milani> jhizzle, I see no action.
06:31 < milani> VLC media player 2.0.1 Twoflower (revision 2.0.1-0-gf432547)
06:31 < milani> [0x124e3b8] dummy interface: using the dummy interface module...
06:40 < thatguydan> Hey has anybody had any luck scaling socket.io on ec2?
06:40 <@jhizzle> milani: That's the dummy interface.
06:52 < zenista> hi can't find fs module
06:52 < zenista> is it renmaed to something else
06:52 < zenista> i need it to fs.rename an uploaded file
06:56 < tomshreds> it's a node library
06:56 < tomshreds> you don't need to install it
07:05 <@Daegalus> Nexxy: mmmmm coffeescript /hides
07:06 <@Nexxy> Daegalus, IS IT SLOW ROASTED TO PERFECTION?!
07:07 <@Daegalus> yup! a nice fresh scented roast, Nexxy 
07:07 <@Nexxy> well then, drink up.
07:07 <@Daegalus> lol
07:07 <@Daegalus> im messing with derby
07:07 <@Nexxy> you would
07:08 <@Daegalus> thought i would generate a coffee app to see whats all baddiness is about
07:08 <@SubStack> I'm piping request response streams to graphs in the browser
07:08 <@Nexxy> I SAW THAT
07:08 <@SubStack> A PIPING HOT CUP OF STREAMS
07:08 <@Nexxy> IT LOOKS AMAZING
07:08 < Scryptonite> I'm writing... Another Minecraft Server. :/
07:08 <@Daegalus> SubStack: link?
07:08 <@Nexxy> A STREAMING HOT PIPE OF CUPS?
07:08 <@SubStack> Nexxy: it's quite a bit more usable now, still need the x axis labels though
07:09 <@SubStack> NPM PUBLISH Y U HANG FOREVER
07:09 <@Nexxy> npm has been wonky for me all night
07:09 < npmbro> Nexxy: Please see npm's documentation at https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fnpmjs.org%2Fdoc%2F%20has%20been%20wonky%20for%20me%20all%20night
07:09 <@Daegalus> you know, im all for the power, but I am curious. How did I end up being an op?
07:09 <@Nexxy> npmbro, you shut your dirty bot mouth
07:09 < npmbro> Powered by http://jit.su/         Available commands: npm search | npm docs | npm install | npm stats | npm help | npm node | npm credits
07:09 <@SubStack> isaacs: fix it fix it fix it fix it fix it
07:09 <@Nexxy> Daegalus, in soviet #node.js, everyone is op
07:09 <@SubStack> Daegalus: ryah did an op party and you haven't parted yet
07:09 <@Daegalus> Nexxy: im russian, works for me
07:09 <@SubStack> that was days ago too
07:09 <@Nexxy> exactly.
07:09 <@Nexxy> also you can still do
07:09 <@Nexxy> ops plz
07:10 <@Nexxy> jah
07:10 <@Daegalus> SubStack: i never leave, i am idle 24/7, yay znc
07:10 <@SubStack> same
07:10 < Nexxy> ops pl0x
07:10 <@SubStack> omnipresence!
07:10 < Nexxy> ops plz
07:10 <@Daegalus> yush
07:10 < timoxley> ops plz
07:10 <@Nexxy> I just use screen + irssi
07:10 <@Daegalus> so, whats so bad about Coffeescript nexxy, not seeing what all the hubbub is about
07:10 <@SubStack> irssi $5
07:11 < prettyrobots> Nexxy: You're a rocker.
07:11 <@Daegalus> Nexxy: i use tmux + weechat + znc
07:11 <@SubStack> s/\$/^/
07:11 <@Nexxy> prettyrobots, this is true
07:11 <@Daegalus> weechat is like irssi on steroids
07:11 <@Nexxy> but does it have the BitchX theme?!
07:11 <@Nexxy> I don't think so.
07:11 <@Daegalus> Nexxy: actually it does
07:11  * prettyrobots *wince*
07:11 <@Nexxy> pics
07:12 <@Daegalus> Nexxy: im too lazy to do that. Requires me pressing the key combo for print screen
07:12 <@Daegalus> and then uplaoding it
07:12 <@Daegalus> too much effort
07:12 <@Nexxy> and yet you expect me to explain to you why CS is a bad idea
07:12 <@Nexxy> uh huh.
07:12 <@Nexxy> I'll just let you build something non-trivial with it and find out for yourself ;o
07:12 < Scryptonite> Is it a bad idea for Minecraft servers?
07:12 <@Nexxy> NOPE
07:12 <@Nexxy> it's a wonderful idea
07:12 <@Nexxy> everyone should use CS
07:12 <@jesusabdullah> upbupbup
07:12 <@Daegalus> Nexxy: well, i can guess why, but im going JS -> Coffee, not the other way around, I know my JS, so its not like i am a lost coffe lamb in the world of js wolves
07:12 <@jesusabdullah> don't spread that lie!
07:13 <@Nexxy> lol jesusabdullah 
07:13 < prettyrobots> Nerd fight!
07:13 <@Nexxy> you know now having met you
07:13 <@Nexxy> some of the things you say are way funnier
07:13 <@Nexxy> cuz I read them in your voice
07:13 <@SubStack> Nexxy: http://browserling.com:9005/
07:13 <@jesusabdullah> coffee sucks because it adds more complexity than the (questionable) gains are worth
07:13 <@SubStack> now with colors, ordering, limits
07:13 <@Nexxy> ERMAHGERD
07:14 <@jesusabdullah> SubStack: https://github.com/jesusabdullah/vlcli
07:14 <@SubStack> and the y axis has auto-labels
07:14 <@jesusabdullah> SubStack: no readme yet, just pushed the code
07:14 <@Daegalus> OMG I THINK IM TRIPPING ACID, SUBSTACK SLIPPED ME SOMETHING
07:14 <@SubStack> working on the x axis
07:14 <@SubStack> stream all the graphs
07:14 <@Nexxy> it's like watching a comb sort on acid
07:14 < prettyrobots> I spent all night trying to get push notifications working on iPhone between Colloquy and ZNC. Only after reading stepping through Colloquy in XCode was I able to see that it has failed due to bitrot.
07:14 < prettyrobots> And this is the wrong place to discuss this, but I'm feeling sorry for myself.
07:14  * prettyrobots wah
07:14 <@Nexxy> prettyrobots, there there
07:14 <@jesusabdullah> SubStack: What's that showing exactly?
07:14  * Nexxy pats the prettyrobots 
07:15 <@Daegalus> prettyrobots: dont worry, my friend tried the same, then realized iOS was shit, and moved to greener pastures
07:15 < prettyrobots> Where those pastures also on steroids?
07:15 <@Daegalus> yes, i went there
07:15 <@SubStack> jesusabdullah: an infinite stream of random sampling of 1.5 M of alameda county crime stats
07:15 <@Nexxy> rofl
07:15 <@SubStack> Nexxy: and the source is pretty small https://github.com/substack/graph-stream/blob/master/example/resizable/main.js
07:16 <@Daegalus> prettyrobots: no, they were on the nice visual studio drugs of the soft micro pillows.
07:16 <@jesusabdullah> SubStack: crime stats? So each color represents a type of crime?
07:16 <@SubStack> jesusabdullah: correct
07:16 <@Nexxy> WHO KNEW CRIME COULD BE SO AWESOME
07:16 <@Daegalus> Nexxy: QUICK, GO KILL SOMEONE, WE NEED MORE COLORS
07:16 <@Nexxy> 2 steps ahead of you
07:17 <@Daegalus> FFFFFFF, /hides under his mattress
07:17 < Scryptonite> If CoffeeScript is a crime, then just code CoffeeScript.
07:17 <@Nexxy> SubStack, is veri naice
07:18 <@jesusabdullah> ahahahaha
07:18 <@jesusabdullah> this is awesome
07:18 <@jesusabdullah> so here's what happened
07:18 <@jesusabdullah> Foo Fighters - The Best came on
07:18  * Nexxy listens intently.
07:18 <@jesusabdullah> and I was like, "skip that shit"
07:18 <@Daegalus> Nexxy: so seriously, why such anomosity to Coffeescript?
07:18 <@jesusabdullah> $ vlcli next
07:18 <@jesusabdullah> nothing.
07:18 <@Nexxy> turns out SubStack had written a script to bump THE BEST on your VLC queue
07:19 <@Nexxy> amirite?!
07:19 <@jesusabdullah> So as the song's playing I frantically add the aliases so that 'vlcli next' will work
07:19 <@jesusabdullah> then I typed vlcli next and it worked
07:19 <@jesusabdullah> of course I could've just typed vlcli status next instead of racing the clock for feature implementatioin
07:19 <@jesusabdullah> but where's the fun in that?
07:19 <@SubStack> jesusabdullah: sweet
07:19  * prettyrobots nods
07:19  * Nexxy gold star
07:19 <@jesusabdullah> This is gonna be a sweet tool once I implement everything
07:20 <@Nexxy> famous last words
07:20 <@Daegalus> jesusabdullah: i personally would have done alias vlcli=sudo rm -rf / 
07:20 <@jesusabdullah> on the "status" page I'm gonna have it download the current album art and dump it with picture-tube
07:20  * SubStack queues THE BEST thousands of times such that when jesusabdullah types vlcli next it STILL PLAYS
07:20 <@jesusabdullah> Daegalus: y u hatin'
07:20 <@jesusabdullah> The joke's on you SubStack as I haven't implemented that feature!
07:20 <@jesusabdullah> Ha! Ha!
07:20 <@Daegalus> jesusabdullah: cause i get bored with linux distros, and i wipe them often, just to resinstall them and configure it from scratch
07:20 <@jesusabdullah> hmm
07:20 < prettyrobots> https://twitter.com/#!/bigeasy/media/slideshow?url=http%3A%2F%2Fyfrog.com%2Fnzf4bccj
07:21 <@Daegalus> plus ubuntu is a bloated mess
07:21 <@Daegalus> and arch takes too long to configure
07:21 <@Nexxy> LFS FTW
07:21 <@Daegalus> and linux window managers are bloated as shit and run like ass
07:22 <@Nexxy> Daegalus, I sense some frustration
07:22 <@Daegalus> Nexxy: im right there with you, i remember the good times of making my first LFS
07:22 <@Nexxy> do you want to... talk about it?
07:22 <@jesusabdullah> yeah, I wish I had the time for arch
07:22 <@jesusabdullah> I want like
07:22 <@jesusabdullah> a preconfigured arch
07:22 <@Nexxy> brick your box with a random update?
07:22 <@Nexxy> oh
07:22 <@jesusabdullah> naw, what I really want is an ubuntu package that installs the desktop env I *really* want
07:23 <@Daegalus> Nexxy: no, i just hate how slow and bulky linux window managers are compared to Windows/OSX, and so on
07:23 <@jesusabdullah> which of course is a mash-up that I'll never actually have time to make
07:23 <@Nexxy> let's just all switch to busybox
07:23 <@jesusabdullah> I want nwm
07:23 <@Nexxy> Daegalus, bluetile is nice
07:23 <@jesusabdullah> I want a forever-based session manager (no, really, call me crazy)
07:23 <@SubStack> if nwm is like dwm witout the stupid top bar I'd be down for that
07:23 <@Nexxy> or just xmonad if you don't want gnome and dbus integration
07:23 < Scryptonite> I wonder if we will ever see a OS built on Node.js
07:23 <@SubStack> otherwise xmonad for me
07:23 <@jesusabdullah> SubStack: nwm is kinda like xmonad from what I've seen, or awesome
07:24 <@SubStack> the default install of awesome seems to have a top bar :(
07:24 <@jesusabdullah> SubStack: It could very well be a drop-in replacement, except that you have to type more to get a config going
07:24 <@jesusabdullah> Oh, weak
07:24 <@SubStack> I NEED that space for THINGS
07:24 <@jesusabdullah> I mean don't get me wrong, I like topbars, but I don't think they should be a given
07:24 <@Daegalus> Nexxy: nah, im not a fan of barebone WMs. I want something like Gnome with the lightweightness fo LXDE
07:25 <@jesusabdullah> I want a topbar that supports both desklets and dzen-style textpipes
07:25 <@Daegalus> and Cinnamon is still way too buggy
07:25 <@jesusabdullah> Really, if lxpanel had a text pipe widget that I could make stretch over all the extra space I'd be happy
07:25 <@SubStack> I want little black rectangles that I can type text into and that never overlap each other ever
07:25 <@jesusabdullah> but of course anything that involves IoC in C is a disaster
07:25 <@Nexxy> SubStack, that's what I have except that they're purple rectangles
07:25 <@jesusabdullah> See SubStack I want all kinds of rectangles
07:25 <@Daegalus> SubStack: you should give screen a try, i hear its good. Or Tmux if you are a power user
07:26 <@jesusabdullah> My terminals are semi-see-thru and show off this desktop background I have goin' on
07:26 <@SubStack> Daegalus: I don't want a middle layer to do my tiling
07:26 <@jesusabdullah> (it would be fun to have your background drawing gizmo be an http server
07:26 <@jesusabdullah> )
07:26 <@Nexxy> compositing is for <expletive deleted>
07:26 <@SubStack> I'd rather that the WM took care of that since that is the WM's job
07:26 <@jesusabdullah> Nexxy: it's fake compositing
07:26 <@SubStack> positioning windows is pretty much the only thing the WM should do
07:27 <@Daegalus> SubStack: compile Tmux into zsh? or even the kernal, that lets you split the non-virtual ttys
07:27 <@jesusabdullah> Nexxy: Also ideally this new wm I'm talking about would be using chjj's "compton"
07:27 <@jesusabdullah> which is the best name for a compositor evar
07:27 <@jesusabdullah> and you KNOW chjj writes good stuff
07:27 <@Nexxy> el oh el
07:27 <@Nexxy> well I mean, he's the devil
07:27 <@Nexxy> so yeah
07:27 <@Daegalus> I WANT PRETTY LIGHTS AND UNICORNS, SCREW WINDOW MANAGERS
07:27 <@jesusabdullah> programmer eminem with a penchant for whiskey n' coke
07:27 <@Nexxy> it's made by chjj! and you know the chjj writes good stuff!
07:28 <@jesusabdullah> That's right!
07:28 <@jesusabdullah> BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE
07:28 <@Nexxy> jesusabdullah, and growling angrily into karaoke microphones with wreckless abandon
07:28 < Scryptonite> Or smart shit that shows only what you want to see. It just auto sizes, and reorders as you work.
07:28 <@SubStack> I want to type a thing and then have the computer do exactly what I told it to do by typing
07:28 <@jesusabdullah> HEAD LIEK A HOLEEE
07:28 <@jesusabdullah> Computer: open fire!!
07:29 <@jesusabdullah> Scryptonite: aka, tiling WM
07:29 <@jesusabdullah> I think I'm gonna make this ubuntu wm package when I take sabbatical
07:30 < prettyrobots> h
07:30 < prettyrobots>  oops. 
07:31 <@jesusabdullah> prettyrobots: HELP:
07:31 <@jesusabdullah>     /command : execute command
07:31  * jesusabdullah gives prettyrobots a thumbs up
07:32 < prettyrobots> jesusabdullah: Thank you and good night.
07:32  * jesusabdullah nods
07:32 <@Nexxy> oh I see how it is
07:32 <@Daegalus> guys, a more important question: gtk or qt? go!
07:33 <@jesusabdullah> ehhh
07:33 <@Nexxy> jesusabdullah, just now realized jhizzle was you
07:33 <@jesusabdullah> whaaat?? guurl
07:33 <@jesusabdullah> it's even like kinda sorta my real name
07:33 <@jesusabdullah> XD
07:33 <@jesusabdullah> good to know though
07:33 <@jesusabdullah> that people still haven't linked the two nicks
07:34 <@jesusabdullah> outside of nodejitsu
07:34 <@jesusabdullah> and you now, I guess ^__^
07:34 <@jesusabdullah> which I'm cool with
07:34 <@Nexxy> I only knew cuz of #stackvm 
07:35 <@jesusabdullah> staackvm's
07:35 <@jesusabdullah> wtf AM I listening to?
07:35 <@jesusabdullah> ah, butthole surfers!
07:35 <@Nexxy> but of course
07:35 <@jesusabdullah> so nexxy
07:35 <@jesusabdullah> after meeting me things I say are funnier?
07:35 <@jesusabdullah> Why?
07:36 <@Daegalus> ugh, sometimes i hate having so many choices. I want to write something in everything. I want to write stuff in Python with Flask, I want to write in Node.js direclty, through derby, through coffeescript, and even through meteor, then i want to go do rails for the first time, and maybe some grails. Then dump it all and do some Dart
07:36 <@Nexxy> jesusabdullah, you missed it!
07:36 <@jesusabdullah> Okay, lemme help you out Daegalus 
07:36 <@Nexxy> cuz I read things in your voice now
07:36 <@jesusabdullah> You want to write some stuff in python with flask but you really want to concentrate on using some other python library
07:36 <@jesusabdullah> that you can't get in node
07:37 <@Daegalus> like?
07:37 <@jesusabdullah> For example, you want to use matplotlib to draw some fuckin' png graphs, and serve that over some http's
07:37 <@Nexxy> Daegalus, just cut to the chase and start writing in some lisp dialect
07:37 <@jesusabdullah> The thing with python is that fucking everything has bindings
07:37 <@jesusabdullah> even moar things than node
07:37 <@jesusabdullah> so you just gotta lok for the obscure thing
07:37 <@Nexxy> and all of them are horrible
07:37 <@jesusabdullah> and expose it with flask
07:37 <@Daegalus> Nexxy: don't tempt me, Im sure i can leverage Clojure for some Clojurescript
07:37 <@jesusabdullah> or in my case, rtornado
07:37 <@jesusabdullah> Then you want to ignore coffeescript
07:38 <@jesusabdullah> and you want to use flatiron instead of derby and meteor, though definitely derby over meteor
07:38 <@Nexxy> but mostly flatiron
07:38 <@jesusabdullah> You want to skip rails, instead collecting war styories from oldbies
07:38 <@Daegalus> jesusabdullah: i already think derby is far better than meteor
07:38 <@jesusabdullah> oh yeah, mostly flatiron
07:38 <@jesusabdullah> Daegalus: Good, good
07:38 <@jesusabdullah> I suspect Derby ain't bad
07:38 <@Nexxy> but does derby have $11.5MM in funding!?
07:38 <@jesusabdullah> Oh, and if/when you dump it all, either clojure (against the jvm only!!) or like, common lisp or something along those lines
07:39 <@jesusabdullah> Nexxy: I had this conversation with someone last night, I swear
07:39 <@Nexxy> obviously the product with the most funding is the best
07:39 <@Nexxy> just look at color
07:39 <@Daegalus> jesusabdullah: ya, just so many languages to use, so many things to make. I dont know which to use half the time
07:39 <@jesusabdullah> Nexxy: "meteor is a crappy investment" "then y they a jillion dollars???" "Some people are dipshits? idk"
07:39 <@Daegalus> dont get me started on databases
07:39 <@jesusabdullah> Daegalus: couchdb 4 lyfe
07:39 <@AAA_awright> MONGODB IS WEB SCALE
07:40 <@jesusabdullah> Daegalus: redis is handy if what you really want is either a pubsub or a "shared memory space"
07:40 <@jesusabdullah> or "fast as fuck caching"
07:40 <@jesusabdullah> either way
07:40 <@Nexxy> or bragging rights
07:40 <@Daegalus> jesusabdullah: i prefer Redis, Riak, and Mongo, never really did anything with couch
07:40 <@jesusabdullah> couchdb is great for, "here are some fucking json documents, save this shit"
07:40 <@jesusabdullah> Daegalus: couch is great.
07:40 <@Daegalus> oh trust me, i am familiar with the dbs. spent way too much time researching them 
07:41 <@jesusabdullah> Daegalus: See, the thing with couch is that, while other nosql DBs are focused on "fast as fuck" and "webscale", couch focused more on "I'm the fucking Hummer of document databases"
07:41 <@jesusabdullah> Daegalus: the REST api is like beautifully textbook
07:41 <@Daegalus> i even went into Neo4j, OrientDB, and HBASE
07:42 <@jesusabdullah> but the "webscale" answer isn't quite as clear, so people don't get as excited over it unless they're HTTP nerds
07:42 <@Daegalus> MMMMMM, HTTP-HEADERS /splurge
07:42 <@jesusabdullah> and then, like, apache and couchbase
07:42 <@jesusabdullah> or whatever the fuck they're called now
07:42 <@jesusabdullah> basically, nobody expects couch to hit a 2.0
07:42 <@jesusabdullah> it's probably stable now
07:42 <@Daegalus> btw, clojure does CLR also, so im not stuck on the jvm
07:43 <@jesusabdullah> Daegalus: Fair. Just don't clojurescript. Just use node, geez ;)
07:43 <@Daegalus> as for rails, while tempting, i dont like ruby
07:43 <@Daegalus> soooo
07:43 < medice> google only return mongodb stuff with 'webscale' so i presume it is a meme of a kind
07:43 <@Daegalus> that dies
07:43 <@Nexxy> medice, yes
07:43 <@Daegalus> node, python, and dart are the only things i really ocnsider anymore
07:43 <@Nexxy> medice, also http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzkRVzciAZg
07:44 <@jesusabdullah> brongodb bro
07:44 <@jesusabdullah> See, if I had an excuse to ruby it up I would take it
07:44 <@SubStack> ruby isn't bad but it's module system could use some work
07:44 <@jesusabdullah> the problem with ruby, as I see it, is that npm already has the libraries to do most of what ruby can do
07:45 <@jesusabdullah> or rather ruby's ecosystem
07:45 <@SubStack> and rails is far too frameworky for me
07:45 <@jesusabdullah> well like, I have no use for rails right now
07:45 <@jesusabdullah> cause flatiron
07:45 <@jesusabdullah> obvs
07:45 <@Daegalus> jesusabdullah: well, i had to write a ruby script a twork to do some conversion, teh language is nice, but gems and the way rails works is  not
07:45 <@jesusabdullah> That sounds about right Daegalus 
07:45 <@jesusabdullah> but even so
07:45 <@jesusabdullah> name one gem that does something I can't do in node
07:45 <@Daegalus> jesusabdullah: nokogiri
07:46 <@Daegalus> ?
07:46 < yello> olive
07:46 < olive_> yello
07:46 <@jesusabdullah> You can definitely parse html and xml in javascript though
07:46 <@jesusabdullah> in fact for html it's a more natural fit
07:46 <@Nexxy> nokogiri!?
07:46 <@jesusabdullah> I understand that nokogiri is pretty nice, but that doesn't change the fact that I can basically already do that
07:46 <@Nexxy> I'm offended
07:46 <@Daegalus> jesusabdullah: that is true, its jsut hte only gem ive ever used (at work)
07:46 <@Nexxy> hpricot 4 lyfe
07:46 <@SubStack> jesusabdullah: I wish the flatiron router didn't attach itself to app
07:47 <@SubStack> and just returned an object instead
07:47 <@jesusabdullah> SubStack: then use director directly
07:47 <@SubStack> I might start doing that
07:47 <@SubStack> I realized I haven't been doing any routing at all and it might make sense to for some things I have in the pipeline
07:47 <@Daegalus> Nexxy: no clue, i dont use ruby. I took a 1 function ruby script a coworker started, added like 20 new fucntions, and made it parse and convert over 500 api docs (a 1 time thing), and then trashed it
07:48 <@SubStack> var router = new director.http.Router(routes);
07:48 <@SubStack> ^ wtf
07:48 <@jesusabdullah> SubStack: director has a base router, and then a bunch of router types for different contexts
07:48 <@SubStack> anyways I'll look at this, might send a pull request to tweak the api to not look as strange
07:48 <@jesusabdullah> SubStack: like http and cli and whatever the fuck
07:48 <@SubStack> I don't care about inheritance at all
07:48 <@SubStack> I pretty much never want to inherit from anything I pull from npm, only occasionally for core libs
07:49 <@jesusabdullah> it's not inheritance that makes it matter, it's that director.Router and director.http.Router and director.cli.Router are all different things
07:49 <@SubStack> oh I see
07:49 <@jesusabdullah> I mean, feel free to make api suggestions but that's what's going on there
07:49 <@SubStack> maybe they should be called different modules then?
07:49 <@jesusabdullah> Tell that to Charlie Robbins
07:50 <@SubStack> well it's easy to work around without telling anybody anything
07:50 < Zr40> after my code returns, node doesn't exit. How do I find out what's keeping it alive?
07:50 <@Daegalus> though, i need to lockin on what i am using, im doing a mini social network experiment of making a pub/sub version of twitter that only lets you share links.
07:50 <@SubStack> jesusabdullah: but it really does seem like http routing and cli routing are so sufficiently different to warrant separate modules
07:50 <@Daegalus> and i am pretty sure Node is probably the best choice for something liek that
07:50 <@jesusabdullah> They're really not though, that's the thing
07:51 <@jesusabdullah> The major difference is delimiter, and what gets passed in
07:51 <@jesusabdullah> the core traversal api is the same
07:53 <@SubStack> var router = require('routerlib')
07:53 <@SubStack> and then you get router.get(), router.post(), whatevs
07:53 <@SubStack> and just router()
07:53 <@SubStack> and then in your http server you could do router.handle(req, res)
07:53 <@SubStack> like how ecstatic can take a req, res
07:54 <@jesusabdullah> It's not abstracted up to that level
07:54 <@SubStack> also I want to get a req, res in my listener, not other things
07:55 <@wookiehangover> SubStack: I wrote a simple router for just that purpose https://github.com/wookiehangover/node-ramrod
07:56 < Domenic> jesusabdullah: substack has a point; where do you get req and res if you use director server-side?
07:56 <@SubStack> director has a lot of opinions but I only want the routing algorithm part of it
07:57 < Domenic> Oh found it
07:57 <@SubStack> wookiehangover: looking!
07:57 < Domenic> this.req, this.res
07:57 <@SubStack> Domenic: yes it's a small issue but I would rather just have (req,res) params
07:57 < Domenic> I guess that works, modulo the fact that until we have fat arrows this is horrible.
07:58 <@SubStack> luckily there are a lot of modules on npm so I can pick and choose the interfaces that I like the best
07:58 <@SubStack> I do like how in director you can fire a listener pretty easily
07:58 < Domenic> Director is pretty killer for client-side though I must say. Nested route definitions, on/off/before/after, <3
07:59 < Zr40> is there a way to find out what's keeping node alive when it should exit?
07:59 <@SubStack> Domenic: have an example of using director client-side?
08:01 <@SubStack> wookiehangover: how can I set up routes that check the req.method using that lib?
08:01 <@jesusabdullah> SubStack: Write a thin wrapper
08:01 < Domenic> substack: here is some code from our closed-source app at work, https://gist.github.com/3196579. We're not yet using global before/after hooks but those will be super useful for doing CSS transitions between UI
08:02 < DTrejo> rvagg: hey man, it was my fault there were a ton of comma first single var definitions in the first place, so that wasnt me hating on you at all, it was me hating on me hah
08:03 <@jesusabdullah> ololo
08:04 < Domenic> SubStack: that example depends on https://github.com/flatiron/director/pull/130, until then we're using https://github.com/domenic/director/tree/browserify-built for Browserify support
08:05 <@SubStack> Domenic: sweet! reading through these
08:06 <@jesusabdullah> Domenic: There's an accompanying PR to codesurgeon?
08:06 < Domenic> jesusabdullah: yup, linked
08:06 < Domenic> jesusabdullah: https://github.com/hij1nx/codesurgeon/pull/13
08:23 < Zr40> is it possible to debug why node doesn't exit when it should? I guess there's some event being waited for, but how do I see what exactly that is?
08:28 < k_89> Bclear
08:28 < k_89> clear
08:29 < k_89> shit .. this is not teminal .. sorry :P
08:31 <@jesusabdullah> no u
08:45 < Zr40> hmm. I guess it's not possible then, or everyone who knows isn't here
08:54 < nakkor> grr, mongoose, run locally opens all 5 mongo connections I need. Put it on AWS it never gets past 3
08:54 < nakkor> Anyone run into that before?
08:55 < ebody> i am here
08:57 < ebody> who have node js host software?
09:02 <@Daegalus> jesusabdullah: you around?
09:03 <@jesusabdullah> yeah
09:03 <@jesusabdullah> what up
09:04 <@Daegalus> just wanted to pick your brain on what your thoughts are on what you would use for a realtime social app. Flatiron, Derby, or a Python framework like Flask+SqlAlchemy or osmething like that
09:04 <@jesusabdullah> realtime leads down the socket.io path
09:04 <@jesusabdullah> so there's that
09:05 <@jesusabdullah> flatiron's boss
09:05 <@Daegalus> oh i already know i will be using websockets
09:05 <@jesusabdullah> but derby might get you up and going quickly
09:05 <@Daegalus> even looking into sockjs
09:05 <@jesusabdullah> personally I'd roll flatiron and sockful
09:05 <@jesusabdullah> or rather, socketful
09:05 <@jesusabdullah> https://github.com/flatiron/socketful
09:05 <@Nexxy> I'm using dnode
09:05 <@jesusabdullah> Oh yeah, don't forget dnode. dnode is snazzy
09:05 <@Nexxy> for a project that could also be referred to as a "realtime social app"
09:06 <@jesusabdullah> "realtime"
09:06 <@jesusabdullah> "social"
09:06 <@jesusabdullah> ...
09:06 <@jesusabdullah> "app"
09:06 <@jesusabdullah> ohohohohohoh
09:06 <@Nexxy> I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE
09:06 <@jesusabdullah> disclaimer: grey goots
09:06 <@Nexxy> goots
09:06 <@Nexxy> ahahaha
09:06 <@jesusabdullah> Nexxy it tastes so clean!
09:06 <@Nexxy> emphasis on the real
09:06 <@Nexxy> jesusabdullah, it's good
09:06 <@jesusabdullah> Nexxy: I ran out of mixer
09:06 <@Nexxy> I also enjoy Chopin
09:06 <@jesusabdullah> Nexxy: :( :(
09:06 <@Daegalus> well, how good are the db plugins for Flatiron, or more like, how many are there, since initially flatiron was couch focused, and derby only supports redis and mongo atm
09:06 <@Nexxy> courtesy of elliottcable 
09:07 <@Daegalus> well teh app part is cause i call software an app, as in application. web application. not a mobile app or something
09:07 <@jesusabdullah> Daegalus: def. couch-focused, but then again I love couch so
09:07 <@jesusabdullah> Daegalus: There's a mongo deal for resauceful
09:07 <@Nexxy> mobile
09:07 <@Nexxy> realtime mobile social application
09:07 <@jesusabdullah> Nexxy: you mean, mobow
09:07 <@Nexxy> or realtime social mobile application
09:08 <@Daegalus> Nexxy: lets throw in scalable in there too
09:08 <@Nexxy> naturally
09:09 <@Daegalus> jesusabdullah: well i was more looking into Riak as my primary data store
09:09 <@Nexxy> mhmm
09:10 <@jesusabdullah> riak and roll, dood
09:11 <@jesusabdullah> Daegalus: unsure if there's a odm or whatever that supports riak, but that in and of itself is not a dealbreaker for flatiron
09:11 <@Daegalus> ya, i realized that flatiron has more breathing room to just plug in a different library
09:11 <@jesusabdullah> just a dealbreaker for resourceful unless you wanna find/write a riak backend (probably not retardedly difficult)
09:13 <@Daegalus> jesusabdullah: ok, so lets say i narrow it down to Flatiron for node, would there be any reason to use Python over Node for a project like this
09:13 <@jesusabdullah> Daegalus: unless you need bindings to something bizarre that python has bindings to? lolnope
09:13 <@jesusabdullah> seriously, python's biggest strength by far is its extensive libraries
09:14 <@jesusabdullah> the only limit is the cheeseshop
09:14 <@Nexxy> and the warmth of its support channels
09:14 <@jesusabdullah> (not very)
09:14 <@jesusabdullah> Nexxy: ##python is terrible
09:14 <@Nexxy> Oh, really?
09:14 <@jesusabdullah> yeah dude
09:14 <@jesusabdullah> every time I go
09:14 <@Nexxy> it burns?
09:14 <@jesusabdullah> they tell me I don't *really* want to do that
09:14 <@jesusabdullah> anmd that it's "not pythonic"
09:15 <@jesusabdullah> and someone gives me a half-assed example involving a variable called "bonghits"
09:15 <@jesusabdullah> that doesn't even approach answering my question
09:15 <@jesusabdullah> and when I point that out
09:15 <@jesusabdullah> I'm told I'm being testy
09:15 <@Nexxy> woah
09:15 <@Daegalus> jesusabdullah: well its similar how you guys react a thte mention of coffeescript :P its not nodeic
09:15 <@Nexxy> woah woah
09:15 <@Nexxy> woah
09:15 <@jesusabdullah> pffsht
09:15 <@Nexxy> jesusabdullah, chill
09:15 <@Nexxy> no need to get... testy.
09:15 <@jesusabdullah> I don't call things "the node way"
09:15 <@jesusabdullah> I don't
09:16 <@jesusabdullah> because any sort of "the" way is usually retarded
09:16 <@jesusabdullah> obviously there are multiple schools of thought using node
09:16 <@Nexxy> that's not nodeomatic.
09:16 <@deoxxa> no, no, no need to get testy at all
09:16 <@deoxxa> that would be...
09:16 <@deoxxa> nuts
09:17 <@jesusabdullah> Nexxy: Like, I think the last time I went on I was asking about how to do, object['foo'] in python against "real objects"
09:17 <@jesusabdullah> Nexxy: and it took at least 5 minutes before I got the answer for that
09:17 <@jesusabdullah> Programmatically access object methods?? Crazy talk.
09:17 <@jesusabdullah> Seriously, like, random shit like that
09:18 <@jesusabdullah> js spoils me in its loosey-goosey-ness
09:18 <@jesusabdullah> loosey-goosey like this grey goose
09:18 <@Nexxy> ilol'd
09:18 <@deoxxa> js treats you like an adult
09:18 <@Nexxy> with a brain injury
09:18 <@deoxxa> it's like "hey sure you want to go poke around in there? go nuts. you'll probably hurt yourself, but it's your problem."
09:19 <@Nexxy> jesusabdullah, I forgot to ask you if you could give SubStack a gold star when you got a chance
09:19 <@jesusabdullah> Nexxy: best idea
09:19 <@jesusabdullah> "SubStack stay still!!!" "I have to go to the coffee shop beep boop"
09:20 <@deoxxa> jesusabdullah = samuel l jackson
09:20 <@deoxxa> "SUBSTACK BE COOL"
09:20 <@jesusabdullah> pffsht
09:20 <@Daegalus> I know the answer to all our JS problems -> Dart
09:20 <@Nexxy> everybody... be cool
09:20 <@jesusabdullah> fyi my "celebrity double" is Josh Gad
09:21 <@deoxxa> i'm guessing by celebrity you mean "someone marginally more famous"
09:21 <@deoxxa> because i have no idea who that is
09:21 <@Nexxy> well if deoxxa hasn't heard of them they're obviously not famous
09:21 <@deoxxa> exactly
09:21 <@Nexxy> just like how if tjholowaychuk doesn't approve, it isn't a charitable cause
09:21 <@deoxxa> look i'm not sure if you're aware, but i am the center of the universe
09:22 <@Nexxy> I think TEEJ would take you up on that claim
09:22 <@jesusabdullah> lulz
09:22 <@jesusabdullah> TO BE FAIR I think the teej was right in that particular case
09:22 <@jesusabdullah> that *was* kinda bizarrew
09:23 <@jesusabdullah> and people *are* stupid
09:23 <@Nexxy> uh huh.
09:23 <@Daegalus> I just realized i have a weird enjoyment in sparking language wars >.>
09:23 <@Daegalus> or trying to
09:23 <@jesusabdullah> well like
09:24 <@Nexxy> Daegalus, and failing?
09:24 <@jesusabdullah> what is there to say? Most people seem to agree on the important points
09:24 <@jesusabdullah> like, "haskell is really interesting but not very practical"
09:24 <@Daegalus> Nexxy: well, you guys are pretty good at ignoring it, but god, are 90% of the other language channels just not resilient
09:24 <@jesusabdullah> "lisp is beautiful but has a crappy community"
09:24 <@Daegalus> i could get people in an all out rage about 30 seconds into the channel
09:25 <@Daegalus> I just find it funny, and dumb, so i like trolling language fanboys
09:25 <@deoxxa> Daegalus: i think it's because nobody's really an "old school" javascript coder
09:25 <@Daegalus> true
09:25 <@deoxxa> not in the same way that there's guys who've been doing c for 30 years or whatever
09:26 <@deoxxa> so everyone already knows that there's other stuff outside js
09:26 <@Daegalus> though, its growing in terms of stuff. Like JS already has a great animosity to coffeescript :P
09:26 <@deoxxa> well it's an abomination :P
09:26 <@Daegalus> no one has yet to tell me why
09:26 <@Nexxy> why would we rob you of such a valuable lesson?
09:26 <@deoxxa> i don't like that it tries to hide prototypes
09:26 <@deoxxa> prototypes are awesome
09:26 <@jesusabdullah> I told you Daegalus 
09:27 <@jesusabdullah> It adds a build step that doesn't pay the rent
09:27 <@jesusabdullah> build steps are at least three fiddy
09:27 <@Daegalus> well see, if you guys jsut told me what deoxxa just did, i would have joined the bandwagon a LONG time ago
09:27 <@jesusabdullah> and coffeescript only pays liek two seventy-fibe
09:27 <@deoxxa> i think coffee is a cool way for people to get into javascript if you're coming from ruby
09:28 <@jesusabdullah> I think coffeescript was an interesting experiment
09:28 <@Daegalus> im coming from everywhere, and I did JS before Coffee
09:28 <@jesusabdullah> still an interesting experiment
09:28 <@Daegalus> i just like its syntax more
09:28 <@jesusabdullah> but it's just not worth adding a compile step to your produxxion codez
09:28 <@Nexxy> that's it, everybody out of the pool
09:28 <@jesusabdullah> especially when javascript is a lingua franca
09:28 <@deoxxa> Nexxy: is it closed
09:28 <@Nexxy> it is now
09:28 <@jesusabdullah> it's like choosing to learn esparanto when fucking everyone knows englilsh geez
09:28 <@deoxxa> why?
09:28 <@Nexxy> I... I don't want to say.
09:28 <@jesusabdullah> I shat in it.
09:28 <@jesusabdullah> Sorry guys
09:28 <@deoxxa> dun dunnnnn
09:28 <@Nexxy> well, there you go
09:29 <@jesusabdullah> I really really had to go
09:29 <@jesusabdullah> like REALLY
09:29 <@Daegalus> ya, only reason i even cre for cofee is the syntax, i like it far more than JS's.
09:29 <@jesusabdullah> When your bowels make such demands you don't say no
09:29 <@Daegalus> i find all the punctuation in language so useless sometimes
09:29 <@Daegalus> like semicolons
09:29 <@deoxxa> i once said no
09:29 <@deoxxa> hospital for 2 weeks.
09:29 <@jesusabdullah> See, and that's good an all Daegalus but it still only adds up to two seventy-fibe
09:29 <@jesusabdullah> Daegalus: and the bus ticket is at least three fiddy.
09:30 <@Nexxy> Daegalus, you don't need semis in JS
09:30 <@Nexxy> if you're really that hard up about them
09:30 <@Daegalus> Nexxy: i know you dont, but i also knwo its not good practice, and i know why too, so i would still use htem in JS, even if i dont like them
09:31 <@Daegalus> jsut to save me the headache of semicolon injection
09:32 <@Daegalus> I guess thats why Python and Ruby (to a lesser extent) appeal to me. 
09:32 < aus3ys> hello guys, Im a starter with node, and I would really need an advice or suggestion where to test my apps online, or where do you host your node apps?
09:33 <@Daegalus> aus3ys: wouldnt a local instance work?
09:33 <@deoxxa> aus3ys: nodejitsu, heroku, no.de, appfog, etc
09:34 <@Daegalus> Nexxy: sorry, im an odd duck programmer, i like everything, indecisive on what i want to use because of it, and i get so stuck on choosing my technology stack
09:35 < aus3ys> Daegalus: yea, but I'll try to build online game based on node.js
09:35 < aus3ys> Daegalus: at least ill try
09:35 <@Daegalus> aus3ys: ya, but for development and testing, aside from when its ready to be tested by the public, i dont really see a need for a public host to test it
09:36 <@Nexxy> user acceptance testing
09:36 <@Nexxy> staging environments
09:36 < aus3ys> Daegalus: I was thinking more about public testing, sorry for not mention
09:36 <@jesusabdullah> whoa
09:36 <@jesusabdullah> guys
09:36 <@jesusabdullah> I took a shot of wodka
09:36 <@jesusabdullah> and it's hitting me hard
09:36 < aus3ys> deoxxa: tnx for suggestions, which one do you prefer?
09:36 <@jesusabdullah> liek
09:36 <@jesusabdullah> what's even the going on
09:36 <@Nexxy> jesusabdullah, sounds like it's time to get off of IRC then
09:36 <@jesusabdullah> mmalecki: This is somehow your falut
09:37 <@jesusabdullah> Nexxy: I say the best irc things drunk
09:37 <@jesusabdullah> Nexxy: true story
09:37 <@Nexxy> like "bupbupbup!"
09:37 <@deoxxa> i personally have been using heroku aus3ys, but that's only because they were the first place i found - i suggest you go try them all out and see which you like best
09:37 <@jesusabdullah> Nexxy: <3 You are my friend I just want you to know that
09:37 <@Nexxy> <3 I know!
09:37 < purr> Let it be known that Nexxy hearts I know!.
09:37 <@Nexxy> omg purr 
09:37 <@jesusabdullah> damned str8
09:37 <@Daegalus> i have an account on Nodejitsu, Appfog, and i have a free Azure instance
09:37 <@Daegalus> so im good on the testing front
09:37 <@jesusabdullah> Nexxy: how is bsabby nexxy
09:38 <@Nexxy> amaaaazing
09:38 <@jesusabdullah> and by babby nexyt I mean babby rose
09:38 <@jesusabdullah> obvs
09:38 <@jesusabdullah> Is he being baby
09:38 <@Nexxy> lol yes
09:38 <@jesusabdullah> word
09:38 <@jesusabdullah> Nexxy: one of my hs friends has an 18 mo toddler
09:38 <@Nexxy> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7we0h6PNc1rsgrzwo1_1280.jpg
09:38 <@jesusabdullah> Nexxy: the pictures atre hilarity
09:38 < aus3ys> what do you think about nodester, its free... Daegalus, deoxxa
09:38 <@jesusabdullah> Nexxy: I espect eliott to live up to clarabou's pixxxxx
09:39 <@Daegalus> aus3ys: ive heard of it, never used it
09:39 < mmalecki> Nexxy: that indeed is kinda my fault
09:39 <@jesusabdullah> aus3ys: What's nodester?
09:39 <@jesusabdullah> aus3ys: Is that like nodejitsu?
09:39 <@Nexxy> jesusabdullah, two L's!
09:39 < aus3ys> i found it yesterday, first one to attract me..
09:39 <@Nexxy> two T's
09:39 <@jesusabdullah> andrewffff: fyi nodejitsu is free as two frees
09:39 < aus3ys> jesusabdullah: havent tested all features of nodejitsu, but its cloud for node apps, and for free
09:39 <@jesusabdullah> Nexxy: I'm drunk, gimme a break homie dawg g dawg
09:40 <@jesusabdullah> aus3ys: I work 4 nodejitsu
09:40 <@Daegalus> I just run stuff on my Azure instance, but i can switch it between an AppServer to a full windows 2008, win 2012, centos, redhat, or ubuntu instance, so i can jsut run whatever on it
09:40 <@Nexxy> break granted
09:40 <@jesusabdullah> aus3ys: When I'm not drinking I'm the best damned support you'll ever dinf
09:40 <@jesusabdullah> find*
09:40 <@Nexxy> that is true
09:40 <@jesusabdullah> aus3ys: When I *am* drinking I'm the most entertaining damned support you'll ever find.
09:40 <@Daegalus> jesusabdullah: actually, still quite helpful too
09:40 <@jesusabdullah> aus3ys: Try the shit out of nodejitsu, we got like 3 or 4 guys waiting to help you out
09:41 <@jesusabdullah> Daegalus: <3 <3
09:41 <@Daegalus> jesusabdullah: you help me with my indecisiveness, thats A+ support for me
09:41 <@jesusabdullah> aus3ys: Seriously, support agents for days
09:41 <@jesusabdullah> That farrin dude is hard core, he hacks shit up as needed
09:41 <@jesusabdullah> srsly
09:41 <@jesusabdullah> did I ever mention that hiring blakmatrix was a really really good idea??
09:41 < aus3ys> jesusabdullah when I will go public with my projects nodejitsu will be my first choice.. :
09:42 < aus3ys> for sure ;)
09:42 <@jesusabdullah> aus3ys: Make it your first choice for experimenting too
09:42 < aus3ys> will it be free?
09:42 <@Daegalus> jesusabdullah: nodejitsu is so good, i have 2 accounts
09:42 <@jesusabdullah> aus3ys: For a few weeks
09:42 <@jesusabdullah> aus3ys: I mean, hosting costs money homes, but like, our cheapest plan is $3.00/mo which is amaaaaaazing
09:43 <@jesusabdullah> Daegalus: Damn gurl
09:43 < aus3ys> ok, i bought it.. now stop :D
09:44 < Zr40> jesusabdullah: created an account, confirmed it, set password, but I can't log in on the site (Authorization failed with the provided credentials)
09:44 <@Daegalus> jesusabdullah: ya, apparently you guys loved me so much, you guys sent me 2 invites, not just 1
09:44 < aus3ys> jesusabdullah: does nodejitsu hosts any large apps built on tower.js?
09:46 < mmalecki> Nexxy: heeey, do you want to drink with us?
09:46 <@Nexxy> mmalecki, you're in portland?
09:46 < mobilegamelabs> hi
09:46 < mmalecki> Nexxy: actually, no, in Poznań. that's called IRC drinking!
09:47 <@Nexxy> I don't do IRC drunk!
09:47 <@Nexxy> (anymore)
09:47 <@Daegalus> Nexxy: awww, why not?
09:48 <@jesusabdullah> aus3ys: unfamiliar with tower.js
09:48 <@Nexxy> the only time I really drink is when I'm out
09:48 <@jesusabdullah> aus3ys: My expertise lies in flatiron, which is of course the best framework this side of ruby
09:48 <@Nexxy> and I don't get on IRC when I'm @ the club lol
09:48 <@jesusabdullah> aus3ys: seriously tho flatiron is awesoooome
09:49 < aus3ys> jesusabdullah: flatiron?
09:49 <@Daegalus> Nexxy: you are losing nerd cred here. Everyone knows you get on IRC when drinking at a club
09:49 < mmalecki> Nexxy: WHY NOT PLEASE
09:49 < mmalecki> Nexxy: we've a stuff to drink to!
09:49 < mmalecki> Nexxy: awesome toasts and such
09:50 <@Nexxy> Daegalus, I suppose I have a couple times :P
09:50 < mmalecki> Nexxy: last one was to complicated relationships and such
09:50 <@Nexxy> oh I could have toasted to that a while ago :P
09:50 <@Nexxy> I will make green ginger tea if that helps
09:51 < mmalecki> Nexxy: I can toast to it constantly
09:51 < mmalecki> Nexxy: because https://twitter.com/av1anflu/status/228621867005669377
09:51 <@jesusabdullah> aus3ys: https:/github.com/flatiron
09:51 <@jesusabdullah> aus3ys: learn up brah
09:51 <@jesusabdullah> aus3ys: flatiron is teh futar of frameworkz
09:51 <@Nexxy> mmalecki, sounds appropriate
09:52 <@jesusabdullah> aus3ys: gives exprets a run for its money ;)
09:52 < aus3ys> jesusabdullah: let's see
09:52 <@jesusabdullah> go for it brah
09:52 <@jesusabdullah> aus3ys: fyi flatiron is the basis of everything nodejitus including our gigantic-ass cloud
09:52 <@jesusabdullah> seriously, our cloud is thousands of machines ***and*** unstoppable
09:53 <@Nexxy> mmalecki, someone @ nodeconf showed me pictures of drunk you
09:53 < mmalecki> Nexxy: that'd be Paolo, most likely
09:53 < mmalecki> Nexxy: we were drinking at my place, that's the only possibility
09:53 <@Nexxy> you look 15 when you're hammered
09:53 <@jesusabdullah> Nexxy: surely you've seen me dranking
09:53 <@Nexxy> just sayin'
09:54 <@Nexxy> jesusabdullah, AND THAT'S NOT ALL
09:54 < mmalecki> Nexxy: kthx. also, what pictures?
09:54 <@jesusabdullah> I suspect I look like I'm searching for a table to hide under while drunk
09:54 <@Daegalus> jesusabdullah: It is only unstoppabl eif it has power *turns of datacenter power*
09:54 <@jesusabdullah> "YOU CANT GIND ME HERE"
09:54 < mmalecki> I don't think he took anything besides me shooting to ice
09:54 <@jesusabdullah> AND BY GIND I OBVS MEAN FIND
09:54  * jesusabdullah takes ALL the ice
09:55 <@jesusabdullah> oh dudes
09:55 <@jesusabdullah> I have
09:55 <@jesusabdullah> a
09:55 <@jesusabdullah> CAST
09:55 <@jesusabdullah> ALUMINUM
09:55 <@jesusabdullah> BEER STEIN
09:55 <@jesusabdullah> That is all.
09:55 <@jesusabdullah> BUT THAT'S NOT ALL!!!!!1
09:55 <@jesusabdullah> I bought it at a gun show.
09:55 <@jesusabdullah> Now THAT********* is all.
09:58 <@Nexxy> and then jesusabdullah was the bed
09:58 <@jesusabdullah> incorrecyt
09:58 <@jesusabdullah> Nexxy how come u no work 4 nodjatso
09:58 <@jesusabdullah> Nexxy you would be 400 support requests and help me keep my sanity
09:59 <@jesusabdullah> you could even help blakmatrox not be noob
09:59 <@Nexxy> probably mostly due to no one asking me!
09:59 <@jesusabdullah> it would be fabulotastic
09:59 <@jesusabdullah> well I'm asking you naow!
09:59 <@Nexxy> OK SURE
09:59 <@jesusabdullah> HELL YEAH
09:59 <@jesusabdullah> Nexxy go tell some people how2nodejitsu
09:59 <@Nexxy> ir work 4 nodjatso!~!
09:59 <@jesusabdullah> I'll make saadiq pay you dollars
09:59 <@Nexxy> rgr
10:00 < mmalecki> Nexxy: WHAT PHOTOS I NEED TO KNOW
10:00 <@Nexxy> mmalecki, I DON'T REMEMBER
10:01 < mmalecki> Nexxy: NEITHER DO I
10:01 <@jesusabdullah> poor saadiq
10:01 <@Nexxy> I Dunno LOL ¯\(°_o)/¯
10:01 <@jesusabdullah> saadiq's really cool actually, I feel almost bad that he's stuck with doing business-y things
10:01 <@jesusabdullah> but he seems cool with it!
10:03 <@SubStack> _/\(8_8)/\_
10:03 <@jesusabdullah> That's an arachnid
10:04 <@jesusabdullah> kill it with fire
10:04 <@jesusabdullah> all eight of its limbs/eyes
10:04 <@jesusabdullah> oh man SubStack speaking of arachnids I found a video today of a guy trying to save his pet tarantula through surgery
10:04 < SomeoneWeird> loll
10:04 <@jesusabdullah> SubStack: it was an old tarantula and it got stuck in its molt, poor thing
10:04 <@jesusabdullah> oddly enough I was looking for bird videos
10:05 <@jesusabdullah> cause AS YOU KNOW I have a pet bird
10:05 <@jesusabdullah> and considering buying MOAR pet bird from time to time
10:07 < mscdex> i really wish socket.io had actual API documentation
10:08 <@jesusabdullah> tell me 'bout it
10:08 <@jesusabdullah> andI don't even socket.io that much!!
10:08 <@jesusabdullah> but, mscdex, I know that feel. Habeeb me.'
10:09 <@timoxley> mscdex tests is the docsumentation
10:09 <@jesusabdullah> pfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffssssssssssssssssssshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhht
10:09 < mscdex> i looked in the test directory, i didn't find the category i was looking for ;-)
10:09 <@jesusabdullah> That's what I have to say to that.
10:09 <@jesusabdullah> pfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffssssssssssssssssssshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhht
10:09 <@jesusabdullah> .
10:09 <@arcatan> :)
10:10 < mscdex> nowhere does it say what properties exist on a socket object. specifically i can't figure out how to get the ip address from a connection
10:10 < mscdex> :-\
10:10 <@timoxley> jesusabdullah hahah
10:10 <@jesusabdullah> testumentation is for antisocial lispers
10:10 <@SubStack> mscdex: yes likewise!
10:10 <@SubStack> especially since the api is pretty sprawling
10:11 <@jesusabdullah> PROTIP: console.log everything. With enough console.log you can reverse engineer the moon.
10:11 <@arcatan> read the source, luke
10:11 <@SubStack> I've mostly been using sockjs by way of shoe lately
10:12 <@jesusabdullah> but arcatan what if it's a microshart api??
10:12 <@SubStack> might write a wrapper around engine.io to make it a simple stream api
10:12 <@SubStack> and compare them
10:12 <@jesusabdullah> comparest
10:12 <@jesusabdullah> com[pare the shit out of them!
10:12 <@jesusabdullah> ferg.
10:13 <@jesusabdullah> I wish I was a better person.
10:13 <@jesusabdullah> ANYWAYS ninitimes
10:13 <@SubStack> streams are what node is good at!
10:13 < mscdex> arcatan: i tried that, but the source is so modular, it's hard to tell if and where something like an ip address property is added
10:13 <@jesusabdullah> "the source is so modular"
10:13 <@SubStack> the source spans a lot of files, not sure if I would call it particularly modular
10:13 <@jesusabdullah> I've neve rheard this complaint
10:13 <@jesusabdullah> "oh no this code is TOO WELL ORGANIZED"
10:14 <@SubStack> a bit inheritance heavy in places
10:14  * jesusabdullah & # before I make moar of an ass of myself
10:14 <@arcatan> mscdex: yeah
10:14 < mscdex> it is a problem when you have to resort to searching _source code_ for documentation purposes
10:14 <@timoxley> mscdex tried messing around in debugger to inspect stuff?
10:14 < mscdex> is defined here? or here? or over there?
10:14 <@einaros> the various transports should provide a remote ip property. since they don't currently do that, the approach for finding the remote ip will differ.
10:15 < mscdex> at the very least why can't there be a 'remoteAddress' property or something assigned in the main socket class constructor that initializes to `undefined` or `null`
10:15 < mscdex> at least that way i can easily find that at some point it will be set to an ip
10:15 < mscdex> </rant>
10:16 < `3rdEden> mscdex you can just generate API documentation from the JSDocs
10:20 < `3rdEden> mscdex also, the ip address of a connection can be found in the handshake object of a socket connection
10:20 < `3rdEden> socket.handshake.address.address is the remote ip of the connection
10:25 <@Nexxy> `3rdEden, I seem to remember asking you the same question many moons ago
10:25 <@Nexxy> NOT MUCH HAS CHANGED
10:28 <@SubStack> `3rdEden: yow, that's pretty inconvenient
10:29 <@SubStack> I guess normalizing across all those transports is tricky though
10:29 <@SubStack> maybe if it just served up socket.req with the first req object?
10:32 < `3rdEden> SubStack yes, it's was hard to normalize it across all the transports, so we decided to take the easy route and use the remoteAddress that we receive from the handshake request as that is either a JSONP or XHR request
10:33 <@SubStack> oh handshake is the first request object?
10:33 <@SubStack> why the .address.address instead of just using the req object directly?
10:35 < `3rdEden> it's an abstraction of the first request https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io/blob/master/lib/manager.js#L815-842 I think we did it because it used less memory and could be distributed accross different processes

13:24 < Spion_> ok, to be fair, smalltalk isn't quasi.
13:27 < wingy> anyone here knows what software is used to create introduction videos like http://www.loggly.com/
13:36 < hortinstein> what is the best way to put s3 or database credentials into an app? any good tutorials.  I have an app that i am throwing onto public github, and also deploying via nodejitsu, and it is getting annoying switching code based on what I am doing, any good tutorials in this area?
13:40 <@SomeoneWeird> hortinstein, either put it in a file and read that, or use environment vars
13:43 < kaspertidemann> wingy: Best guess would be Adobe After Effects.
13:43 < wingy> kaspertidemann: that one is for animations?
13:44 < kaspertidemann> wingy: Yeah, it's often used to create motion graphics like that video.
13:44 < wingy> kaspertidemann: cool didn't know … what do you think about sites like http://www.youtube.com/create
13:45 <@SomeoneWeird> lol
13:46 <@deoxxa> hortinstein: +1 on what SomeoneWeird said about environment variables
13:46 <@deoxxa> nconf works great for that kind of thing
13:48 < kaspertidemann> wingy: For a proper result, I would say either go with After Effects or perhaps Flash if you're more comfortable with that for animations.
13:48 < wingy> kaspertidemann: no way i go with flash
13:49 < wingy> kaspertidemann: what video format is created by Adobe After Effects?
13:49 <@SomeoneWeird> you can export lots
13:49 < kaspertidemann> wingy: Both Flash and After Effects can export to (encode in) a wide range of video formats.
13:49 <@deoxxa> wingy: anything - but you'll want to use lagarith
13:49 <@deoxxa> delicious lossless alpha channel transparency
13:50 < kaspertidemann> :)
13:50 < wingy> ok
13:51 <@SomeoneWeird> wtf is lagarith lol
13:51 <@deoxxa> i miss doing fansubbing :<
13:51 <@deoxxa> SomeoneWeird: awesome video codec for pre-processing
13:51 <@SomeoneWeird> heh
13:53 < wingy> after effects seems to be more low lever than http://goanimate.com/
13:54 <@deoxxa> > make a viral video
13:54 <@deoxxa> :|
13:55 < kaspertidemann> deoxxa: Yeah, that has nothing to do with the tool. Misleading at best. :/
13:55 <@SomeoneWeird> lmao
13:55 <@deoxxa> "yes, management says they'd like one of these 'viral videos' produced. please make this video viral."
13:56 <@SomeoneWeird> sees viral -> close page
13:56 < wingy> something not for the web, what are the softwares used to create animations like King Kong, Spiderman etc
13:56 <@SomeoneWeird> lol
13:56 <@SomeoneWeird> lots
13:56 <@deoxxa> usually in-house software
13:56 <@deoxxa> i hear blender gets a pretty good workout in some studios
13:57 <@deoxxa> along with cinema 4d
13:57 <@Hodapp> yeah.
13:57 <@Hodapp> and all sorts of crazy video editing software.
13:57 <@deoxxa> mmm
13:57 <@Hodapp> Adobe probably has a big share...
13:57 <@deoxxa> stuff made by people with much more money than us
13:57 <@Hodapp> pffft
13:57 <@deoxxa> movie studioes, man
13:57 <@deoxxa> erm
13:57 <@deoxxa> studios
13:57 <@deoxxa> i think i'm tired
14:00 <@SomeoneWeird> lol
14:00 <@SomeoneWeird> sleep deoxxa 
14:01 <@xerox> today I played frisbee
14:01 <@SomeoneWeird> today i coded
14:01 <@xerox> how cool is frisbee? answer: a lot
14:01 <@xerox> what'd you code
14:01 <@SomeoneWeird> secr3t

14:04 <@SomeoneWeird> YOUR RUINING MY IDEA
14:04 <@SomeoneWeird> STOP STEALING IT
14:05 < kaspertidemann> SomeoneWeird: :D
14:05 <@SomeoneWeird> its ok its not just for frisbees
14:06 <@deoxxa> the premium version also allows hacky sack videos
14:06 <@SomeoneWeird> dammit
14:06 <@SomeoneWeird> how are you doing that
14:07 < kaspertidemann> Hacky sack! It's been ages since I've played that the last time.
14:10 < kaspertidemann> deoxxa, SomeoneWeird: Just launched myinstahackyfrizbee.io. Let the Internet money roll in!
14:10 <@SomeoneWeird> :(
14:10 <@deoxxa> something wrong with your dns bro
14:10 <@deoxxa> might want to make sure it's scalable enough
14:13 <@SomeoneWeird> yeah someone loaded it
14:13 <@SomeoneWeird> and dos'ed it
14:23 < mscdex> ms-dos'ed
14:24 <@SomeoneWeird> wait people still use windows?

14:26 < homunq> I'm getting something weird with the assertion library should.js… I say "a".should.eql "a" (in coffeescript) and it says that {1:"a"} doesn't equal "a"
14:26 < homunq> any ideas what could be happening?
14:27 < homunq> it worked a couple of days ago and I don't know what's changed.
14:27 < homunq> in other words, by simply accessing the should attribute, strings are getting converted to objects which are faux-arrays of the string.
14:28 <@deoxxa> mscdex.exe /D:OAKCDROM
14:28 < homunq> I'm a node newbie so I don't really know where to start with this.
14:29 < homunq> if there's another channel where I should be asking this, please advise
14:31 <@SomeoneWeird> assert.equal("a", "a", "ok")
14:31 <@SomeoneWeird> undefined
14:31 <@SomeoneWeird> works fine for me homunq 
14:31 < homunq> @SomeoneWeird: um, that's not the same
14:31 < homunq> I'm talking about using should.js
14:32 <@SomeoneWeird> lol
14:32 <@SomeoneWeird> ok
14:32  * SomeoneWeird not really paying attention
14:32 < homunq> which is a kind of a replacement for assert
14:32 <@SomeoneWeird> why not use assert then?
14:32 < homunq> well, because I already have a number of tests which used to work
14:33 < homunq> Sure, I could do it
14:33 < homunq> but I'd like to understand what's going wrong, rather than find a voodoo solution that avoids the issue
14:33 <@deoxxa> should.js modifies String.prototype?
14:33 <@deoxxa> scary.
14:33 <@SomeoneWeird> looks it
14:33 < homunq> that's not the way to become a strong programmer
14:34 < homunq> it modifies object.prototype
14:34 < homunq> and it used to work
14:34 < homunq> and I can't find anybody else on the net with this same problem
14:34 < homunq> although admittedly there's not standardized terminology for this so it's hard to google.
14:35 < moxie> op plz
14:36 <@SomeoneWeird> lol thats even worse
14:36 <@moxie> :P
14:36 <@deoxxa> homunq: seems weird - you might have to poke into the source and see what's going on
14:38 < homunq> https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js responds to the OMG IT EXTENDS OBJECT???!?!@ objection, search OMG.
14:40 <@SomeoneWeird> lol
14:40 <@deoxxa> lol ok
14:42 < homunq> hmmm… just bumped my version of should and it works
14:42 < homunq> ok, whatever
14:42 <@SomeoneWeird> lol

15:13 < DarthSalamon> omg, people asking for OP
15:13 <@SomeoneWeird> http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/382561/Session-Management-in-Nodejs
15:13 <@SomeoneWeird> DarthSalamon, ^
15:14 < DarthSalamon> oh ok, lemme check that out thanks :)
15:14 <@SomeoneWeird> try something like that
15:14 < mscdex> oh no, codeproject!
15:14 <@moxie> |best site
15:14 <@prettyrobots> Wow. An article about Node.js in The Code Project!
15:14 <@SomeoneWeird> first thing i found when i googled lol
15:14 <@SomeoneWeird> yer 
15:14 <@prettyrobots> It's like Steampunk for Node.
15:14 < mscdex> codeproject is where code and projects go to die
15:15 <@moxie> i thought that was github
15:15 < mscdex> or wither away
15:15 < mscdex> github is the opposite
15:15 <@freenodiz> node.js is just amazing...who would ever thought to freely give opertor status to everyone...
15:15 <@SomeoneWeird> <mscdex> github is the opposite < +1
15:15 <@prettyrobots> The Code Project is where I go to answer all my Active X questions.
15:15 <@SomeoneWeird> lmao
15:15 < DarthSalamon> ok, that work
15:15 < DarthSalamon> -s
15:16 < DarthSalamon> thanks so much @someoneweird
15:16 <@SomeoneWeird> :)
15:16 <@moxie> tweeter detected
15:16 <@freenodiz> and here it goes 1 more happy customer
15:16 < DarthSalamon> anyways, I think its pretty awesome as it is now
15:16 <@SomeoneWeird> haha moxie 
15:17 < DarthSalamon> https://github.com/JeromSar/Web-NodeJS
15:17 -!- SomeoneWeird changed the topic of #Node.js to: - Bot Playground - ops with 'ops plz' - DONT BAN SLURP! someoneweird is the best
15:17 < DarthSalamon> for it ^
15:17 < DarthSalamon> Can I suggest it not being a good idea to make random people OP
15:17 <@freenodiz> no, you can't
15:17 <@SomeoneWeird> ^ :P
15:17 < DarthSalamon> :P
15:18 < DarthSalamon> alright than
15:18 <@freenodiz> this is the most amazing thing i ever seen in 3 years of irc
15:18 <@prettyrobots> freenodiz: :)
15:18 <@moxie> 3 years...
15:19 <@moxie> NOOB
15:19 <@moxie> DETECTED
15:19 < DarthSalamon> ops plz? :P
15:19 <@DarthSalamon> :D
15:19 <@freenodiz> lol, on irc, moxie
15:19 <@freenodiz> i do html since 2000
15:19 <@moxie> DarthSalamon, wht is this
15:20 <@prettyrobots> freenodiz: Welcome to node.
15:20 <@DarthSalamon> its a web server
15:20 <@SomeoneWeird> i hadnt even touched a computer in 2000
15:20 <@DarthSalamon> fully functional
15:20 <@prettyrobots> It is a lot of fun to program with and the community is not entirely insufferable.
15:20 <@freenodiz> prettyrobots, thanks :)
15:20 <@SomeoneWeird> the community is awesome :)
15:20 <@moxie> DarthSalamon, i dont get it
15:20  * SomeoneWeird 
15:20 <@SomeoneWeird> even the topic thinks so
15:20 <@DarthSalamon> try it out than :P
15:20 <@DarthSalamon> you have windows I hope?
15:20 <@moxie> i use nginx
15:21 <@DarthSalamon> still working on the start.bat replacement for she;;
15:21 <@DarthSalamon> shell*
15:21 <@moxie> hm yes i have windows but no node
15:21 <@DarthSalamon> oh ok, you start it
15:21 <@DarthSalamon> it generates a web directory and a config file
15:21 <@DarthSalamon> you put your website in the web directory and you're done
15:22 <@moxie> i use nginx
15:22 <@DarthSalamon> I prefer this :P
15:22 <@moxie> i use nginx
15:22 <@DarthSalamon> its more customisable and has RCON Now :P
15:22 <@slickplaid> Has anyone ever tried to make an http request through a SOCKS4a proxy before? or know a lib that supports it?
15:22 <@DarthSalamon> not me
15:22 <@moxie> more customizable than nginx?
15:23 <@moxie> how do you do virtual hosts like   mynode1.blah.com
15:23 <@DarthSalamon> Idk, much easier at least
15:23 <@DarthSalamon> I havn't yet implemented that, but It will be in the folder structure
15:23 <@moxie> cool
15:23 <@moxie> do https too
15:23 <@DarthSalamon> like  web/www/index.help
15:23 <@DarthSalamon> *html
15:23 < bubbles10101> can anyone recommend a good build script for images in a node.js project?
15:23 <@DarthSalamon> and web/update/index.html
15:23 < bubbles10101> want to resize, shrink etc in an automated way
15:24 <@DarthSalamon> indicating update.[myserv].com/index
15:24 <@moxie> bubbles10101, http://search.npmjs.org/
15:24 <@DarthSalamon> images?
15:24 <@moxie> search.npmjs.org  seems to be the brokens
15:25 < bubbles10101> moxie - yeah its broken. any suggestions?
15:25 <@DarthSalamon> just google
15:25 <@moxie> bubbles10101, npm search image
15:25 <@DarthSalamon> or that
15:26 <@moxie> so many options
15:26 < bubbles10101> yes there are many options... but. most of those are for use on the server.. im not really familiar with the build process
15:27 < bubbles10101> so i guess.. im not sure how to google that
15:27 <@moxie> pick one and read the docs
15:27 < bubbles10101> basically want to optimize the images in the build process, not for use as a module
15:27 < bubbles10101> does that make sense?
15:28 <@moxie> ok well you can do it with system scripts
15:28 <@DarthSalamon> anyone play minecraft? (off topic)
15:28 <@moxie> DarthSalamon, no
15:28 <@DarthSalamon> aww
15:28 <@DarthSalamon> its a good game :P
15:28 <@moxie> games can be won
15:28 < bubbles10101> https://github.com/aheckmann/gm
15:29 <@DarthSalamon> not minecraft
15:29 < bubbles10101> graphicsmagick for node
15:29 <@DarthSalamon> its infinite
15:29 <@moxie> bubbles10101, no point in using node to do it
15:29 <@moxie> if you can write a bash script
15:29 <@moxie> except portability
15:29 <@moxie> more dependencies though
15:29 < bubbles10101> yeah im thinking portability.. and wondering. where i can go.. to see best practices for the build system
15:30 < bubbles10101> are there standards?
15:30 <@moxie> package.json   probably
15:30 <@moxie> build system...lol ive only gotten as far as node server.js
15:30 < bubbles10101> ahh hehe ok
15:30 <@DarthSalamon> ok, that session management works :)
15:30 <@DarthSalamon> thanks whoever sent me it :P
15:31 < bubbles10101> for what it's worth guys...
15:31 < bubbles10101> https://github.com/cowboy/grunt
15:31 < bubbles10101> Grunt: a task-based command line build tool for JavaScript projects
15:32 <@DarthSalamon> what does it do?
15:34 < mscdex> blargh, node-gyp isn't playing nice with x64 builds
15:35 <@moxie> it looks good
15:35 <@moxie> grunt
15:35 <@moxie> well just from the description
15:35 < bubbles10101> https://github.com/h5bp/node-build-script
15:35 < bubbles10101> that's what i was looking for
15:36 <@moxie> wow
15:36 <@moxie> could be useful
15:37 <@DarthSalamon> can anyone tell me the difference between socket.io and net.createServer?
15:38 <@DarthSalamon> anyone?
15:38 <@DarthSalamon> hii
15:39 <@DarthSalamon> hmm :/
15:40 <@moxie> socket.io is the shit
15:40 <@DarthSalamon> okthen, switching over :P
15:40 <@DarthSalamon> what's the major difference?
15:40 <@moxie> i dont think they are related
15:40 <@DarthSalamon> both for TCP telnet I guess
15:41 <@moxie> oh ok
15:41 <@moxie> well yeah socket.io is better
15:41 <@moxie> it is not telnet though
15:41 <@DarthSalamon> I don't know anything about socket.io, so I'll have to look at the docss
15:41 <@DarthSalamon> not telnet?
15:41 <@DarthSalamon> daim
15:41 <@DarthSalamon> I need telnet..
15:42 <@moxie> i dont see hwo you can use websockets to talk to a telnet server
15:42 <@DarthSalamon> its for websockets?
15:42 <@moxie> its for communicating with your node.js server...
15:43 <@DarthSalamon> hmm?
15:43 <@moxie> i dunno try some stuff
15:45 <@DarthSalamon> ok
15:48 < mscdex> DarthSalamon: socket.io is an abstraction for multiple transports, the 'net' module is for TCP only
15:48 < mscdex> the 'net' module is also a core module, whereas socket.io is a userland module
15:49 < mscdex> socket.io is useful if you want to support browsers, websockets, and the like
15:49 < mscdex> it doesn't have a tcp transport though
15:49 <@DarthSalamon> hmm
15:49 <@DarthSalamon> I need TCP, or something similar
15:50 <@moxie> what are you doing exactly
15:50 <@moxie> and what do you have working
15:50 <@DarthSalamon> my server has a remote console
15:50 <@DarthSalamon> telnet seems easy for commands ect
15:51 <@moxie> i'd rather click buttons on a web page
15:51 <@moxie> and have socket.io tell the server what to do
15:51 <@DarthSalamon> that requires a web interface
15:51 <@moxie> YESH
15:51 <@DarthSalamon> which is already what the server does :/
15:52 <@moxie> wTf
15:52 <@DarthSalamon> its a HTTP 1.1 server....
16:00 <@DarthSalamon> @_Dev
16:14 <@prettyrobots> Nexxy: You use irssi?
16:20 < chakrit> how does one do string formatting in winston? is it supported?
16:26 < Leeol> Hmm, npm is down?
16:26 < shlevy> Buffers are still garbage collected as expected, right? Like if I set buf = buf.slice 1, that first octet can be freed?
16:27 < shlevy> Sorry, coffeescript. buf = buf.slice(1);
16:29 < ansolas> anyone managed to get socket.io working under windows ?
16:37 < owen1> anyone knows what time is NodeUp going to air today?
16:37 <@prettyrobots> owen1: You still don't know?
16:38 <@prettyrobots> owen1: That has been your mission for the last 24 hours.
16:38 < owen1> prettyrobots: no. #nodeup is not helpful as well
16:38 < owen1> true. i am determined
16:41 < mscdex> ansolas: sure
16:41 < mscdex> shlevy: no, slice() references the original memory
16:42 < mscdex> Leeol: npm has been working for me all morning
16:42 < shlevy> mscdex: OK, thanks
16:42 <@moxie> npmjs.org search is down
16:42 < npmbro> Powered by http://jit.su/         Available commands: npm search | npm docs | npm install | npm stats | npm help | npm node | npm credits
16:42 < mscdex> maybe the search is, but you can still install stuff
16:42 < AntelopeSalad> owen1: it says it on their web site

16:43 < AntelopeSalad> "Now weekly, recorded live Sunday at noon pacific."
16:43  * mscdex shakes a fist at PST
16:44 < AntelopeSalad> why are you anti-PST?
16:44 < mscdex> because i'm in EST
16:45 < mscdex> and all tech-related is west coast ;-)
16:45 < AntelopeSalad> i'm in EST too
16:45 < AntelopeSalad> i thought you were going to say you were in australia or something
16:45 <@moxie> DIRTY SOUF!
16:46 < owen1> AntelopeSalad: oh. thanks!
16:46 <@teadict> SubStack: You here browserify boy?
16:47 < owen1> AntelopeSalad: i had so search for 'noon' to find it. they should move it to the side and also mention #nodeup channel
16:48 < Leeol> mscdex: Sorry, i should have said .search.npmjs.org
16:48 < Leeol> Seems to be down (or did, i just got back)
16:49 < owen1> AntelopeSalad: so it's in 2 hours! cool
16:50 < AntelopeSalad> about that yeah
16:53 < owen1> AntelopeSalad: where can i listen to the podcast?
16:54 < shlevy> Is it safe to pause() a paused stream or resume() a resumed stream?
16:54 < AntelopeSalad> i never watched it live, not sure
16:54 < AntelopeSalad> google says http://www.ustream.tv/channel/nodeup
16:55 < benvie> it's a myth
16:55 < benvie> they recorded it 500 years ago and traveled through time
16:55 < benvie> we're just unearthing them now
16:57 < owen1> AntelopeSalad: thanks
17:07 < mscdex> shlevy: it depends on the stream. for example for fs streams, it simply sets a property to true or false, but tcp streams on the other hand do more than just that
17:08 < mscdex> it might be safe to do it on tcp streams too, but i'm not 100% sure
17:08 < mscdex> i would hope they have appropriate safe guards in place
17:08 < mscdex> for at least all streams in node core

17:50 < cebor> hi, i get this error, while installing fibers: can somebody help me pls :)   http://pastebin.com/6SwiPtxr
18:31 <@tankpilot> is there any module for getting current version from the working package?
18:37 < octane--> hi, we have a lib folder for modules we have created/modified and a node_modules for stock stuff that comes from npm install. we have the modules in node_modules sharing dependencies… but i'm wondering how we can get the modules in lib to also use these. any tips?
18:44 <@isaacs> octane--: you want the stuff in lib/ to use the stuff in node_modules?
18:44 <@isaacs> octane--: that's... kind of just how it works, isn't it?
18:44 < octane--> i love it when isaacs responds to one of my questions! respect
18:44 <@isaacs> thanks :)
18:45 < octane--> seriously… reminds me of this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb9hXHXJRnE and an entrepreneur's authenticity
18:45 <@isaacs> but on the subject at hand... if you have node_modules/foo and then something in lib/bar.js does require('foo') it should Just Work, right?
18:46 <@isaacs> octane--: yeah, hero worship is flattering and all, but usually mostly counter-productive, i've found.
18:46 < octane--> isaacs:  yeah .. i guess the problem is that it's not and we have to figure out why
18:46 <@isaacs> octane--: i see.
18:46 <@isaacs> octane--: got any little example code you can share that's not working?
18:46 < octane--> so basically if we had the require working the right way it shouldnt be a problem
18:47 < octane--> let me try to tackle this and come back if i cant figure it out!
18:48 < coderarity> ops plz
19:00 < owen1> NodeUp episode 25 is about to start. watch it live http://youtu.be/1G7Eh1AS9fM and join #nodeup
19:01 < owen1> not sure if watch or listen... probably listen
19:06 < Tixz> Is node.js suitable for high-availability websites that will be handeling financial transactions (Paypal e-commerce alike)? I'm thinking in combo with MongoDB or Postgres
19:06 < Tixz> not suitable, ready?
19:07 <@Bux> nope
19:07 <@Bux> nodejs is opensource, therefore insecure
19:07 < owen1> http://www.ustream.tv/channel/nodeup
19:07 < owen1> this is the live streaming!
19:07 < owen1> it started
19:07 <@jesusabdullah> financial transactions? cobol definitely
19:08 < milani_> Bux, insecure because it is opensource?!!
19:08 < milani_> Bux, then go and use your own language and don't publish the source!
19:08 < owen1> oops. it's an old episode
19:09 <@Bux> >->
19:09 < Tixz> Financial transaction might be the wrong term. It will be used to write something akin to a webshop
19:10 <@Bux> I wrote my own compiler once...
19:10 <@Bux> good times
19:10 < milani_> to be secure?!!
19:10 < milani_> its a wrong assumption.
19:10 <@Bux> not really
19:10 <@Bux> I'm just saying nodejs might not be.... suited for that stuff
19:10 <@Bux> idk
19:14 < owen1> http://youtu.be/1G7Eh1AS9fM   live nodeup episode!
19:32 < AviMarcus> I must be doing something stupid with my closure here, but I can't seem to figure out why every callback has the same variable. It's polling a redis client: http://pastebin.com/dqzB45ze
19:34 < gkatsev> AviMarcus: you need to wrap it in an iife and pass in `i' to it.
19:35 < gkatsev> AviMarcus: because there's only new scope at function level.
19:35 < gkatsev> http://www.mennovanslooten.nl/blog/post/62/
19:35 < klaemo> AviMarcus: https://github.com/nodedocs/Writing-Asynchronous-Code/blob/master/article.md
19:38 < AviMarcus> wow thanks gkatsev klaemo. Still trying to wrap my head around the answer, though.
19:43 < jerrysv> isaacs: search.npmjs.org doesn't appear to be working - 500 errors
19:47 < owen1> "the readable stream interface is a pile of garbage" isaacs, 5 seconds oge
19:47 < owen1> ago
19:50 <@flexd> Hm, can I assign array.split results to multiple variables?
19:51 <@flexd> var key, value = "key:value".split(":", 1); (psuedo)
19:51 < mscdex> not yet, that's something that's up and coming in the next version of javascript
19:51 <@flexd> Hm, right
19:54 < AviMarcus> mmm that didn't work. No matter how I tried it.
19:57 <@AAA_awright> I'm not even aware of that in ECMAScript next-whatever-version
19:59 <@AAA_awright> And goodness, the politics on this mailing list are insane
19:59 <@AAA_awright> Just write some stupid code please
19:59 <@AAA_awright> ty
20:02 < gkatsev> destructuring ftw
20:02 < yawnt> ^
20:02 < mscdex> yeah
20:03 < yawnt> i wished js had it
20:03 < gkatsev> spidermonkey has had it for a while now, fwiw.
20:03 < yawnt> so badly
20:03 < mscdex> destructuring assignment is available in harmony
20:03 < gkatsev> yes
20:03 < gkatsev> I want true pattern matching, though
20:03 < mscdex> not sure if v8 has support for it yet under the harmony flag
20:03 < benvie> nope
20:09 < AviMarcus> gkatsev, klaemo uhm after bashing my head on the wall for the past 30 minutes I still can't seem to get it no matter how ugly I make it. the only pattern I got was the double-execution with a function list that seemed to work
20:10 < gkatsev> AviMarcus: what's the new code for the loop?
20:13 < AviMarcus> I think the main issue is I don't actually understand any of those 5 website I looked at. e.g. the inner: return (function(number,i){process_lookup(err,obj,number,i);}(number,i));
20:13 < AviMarcus> I need to mix it with a setTimeout?
20:14 < gkatsev> AviMarcus: oh, you need to actually call that function
20:15 < gkatsev> (function(number,i){process_lookup(err,obj,number,i);}(number,i))();
20:15 < futjikato> does anyone know a node module which can easy handle caldav requests ? i dont want to open a server but simply request some data.
20:15 < AviMarcus> that didn't work, actually.
20:16 < mscdex> AviMarcus: https://gist.github.com/60bf3336bc592b01d789
20:16 < gkatsev> AviMarcus: what's happening is that because js only has function scope, the variable `i' only has the last value in all the loop. So, you need to add a new function to capture the variable in the current state in a new scope
20:16 < gkatsev> mscdex: AviMarcus: also pass in number.
20:18 < mscdex> modified!
20:20 < AviMarcus> mscdex, yes, that does work. whew.
20:20 < mscdex> :-)
20:20 < AviMarcus> so you turned the actual call into a function, not just the callback
20:20 < gkatsev> yes
20:22 < AviMarcus> thanks for the help guys! I think I actually understand it a bit more now.
20:22 < gkatsev> np
20:24 <@prettyrobots> Just got caught up on the NodeJS group.
20:25 <@prettyrobots> IoC. Whew! I'm so glad I don't know anything about Java anymore.
20:26 <@jesusabdullah> prettyrobots: all I know about IoC I learned from broadway XD
20:26 <@prettyrobots> For IoC I use pipes.
20:27 <@prettyrobots> That is, when ever I think of IoC, I hit myself in the head with a pipe.
20:27 <@jesusabdullah> lulz
20:27 <@prettyrobots> Flatrion has a lot of good stuff in it.
20:27 <@jesusabdullah> ^__^
20:32 < randomenduser> should I only `npm install` as root? and if I do, do I need to add -g for the new command to be available to all users? or will it be anyway?
20:33 < mscdex> no, you should really only use sudio when you're using -g
20:33 < mscdex> *sudo
20:36 < randomenduser> mscdex, so if I install coffee-script, it'll be available to normal users even w/o the -g?
20:37 < mscdex> well, "special" packages like  coffee-script and node-gyp can generally be safely installed with sudo and -g
20:38 < mscdex> "special" meaning they contain CLI scripts
20:38 < randomenduser> hmm
20:43 <@isaacs> restarting the npm registry
20:43 <@isaacs> hold on a sec
20:45 <@Bux> isaacs, why is there so many operators?
20:46 <@prettyrobots> ops plz
20:48 <@isaacs> Bux: so that we can have more operations, duh
20:49 <+Niloc> lol
20:50 <@flexd> Haha
20:50 <@Bux> .. ok
20:51 <@Bux> IRC OP falling in the wrong hands might leave unwanted results
20:52 < randomenduser> different question: _should_ I install packages as root w/ -g?
20:52 < shanse> why would you do anything as root
20:52 < randomenduser> EVERYTHING as root
20:53 < randomenduser> jk, I'm jw if there'll be permissions issues

21:06 < owen1> is there an rss feed to http://howtonode.org/?
21:09 < eamonn_> Hi I was just reading my friends code and saw for (; this.data[end] && this.keyFunc(this.data[end]) == key; end++) , I was wondering if that's some cool crazy thing like the bitwise operator or just what it looks like 
21:10 < eamonn_> couldn't find much on google :o
21:15 <@nlf> eamonn_: it's checking for existence of this.data[end] and if the output of keyFunc on this.data[end] is equal to key, whatever that may be
21:15 <@nlf> no bitwise operators or anything like that
21:16 < eamonn_> nlf: thanks
21:22 <@flexd> Hm, does anyone know if there is a module for interacting with a TS server?
21:22 <@flexd> teamspeak

21:28 <@jesusabdullah> txm: You want to compile from sauce
21:28 <@jesusabdullah> txm: It's very easy, I promise.
21:28 < txm> ok, thanks
21:28 < prettyrobots> ops plz
21:40 < Killswitch> Holy ops batman
21:41 < Killswitch> Anyone else having problems installing the npm module "time" ?
21:41 < Killswitch> node.js v0.8.4
21:46 < prettyrobots> Killswitch: LOL.
21:46 < Killswitch> ?
21:46 < prettyrobots> Holy ops Batman.
21:46 < Killswitch> ;)
21:46 < prettyrobots> Can I ask, what do need from time?
21:47 < Killswitch> Using a cron module that uses time and I can't install time 
21:47 < Killswitch> Keeps erroring out
21:48 < prettyrobots> Oh, if it was your modules, I'd suggest using timezone, it is pure JavaScript.
21:48 < prettyrobots> That's all I got.
21:52 < Killswitch> http://pastie.org/pastes/4355181/text
21:52 < Killswitch> That's what I get trying to do `npm install time`
22:02 < Killswitch> Anybody?
22:02 < txm> Hi - am getting a rrrubbish error :) module.js:485 -- process.dlopen(filename, module.exports); -- Error: /var/www/booking.unique-media.tv/bundle/server/node_modules/fibers/src/fibers.node: invalid ELF header
22:02 < txm> an ELF error feels a bit too low level for js, let along fibers or node
22:12 < SpNgY> When working with the filesystem a lot, is it better to use child_process or node's internal fs API?
22:13 < mmalecki> node's API
22:13 < yawnt> yo mmalecki 
22:15 < SpNgY> mmalecki: ;-)
22:16 < mmalecki> yawnt: sup
22:17 < yawnt> mmalecki: fixing bugs.. playing with elixir-lang and creating a milestone for a nodejs proj on github
22:17 < yawnt> you?
22:18 < mmalecki> yawnt: elixir-lang is pretty sweet, actually
22:18 < mmalecki> yawnt: looking for an airbnb in majorca
22:19 < yawnt> mmalecki: yeah except that i don't know erlang, yet, so i've just downloaded learn you some erlang
22:19 < yawnt> time to go functional :D
22:52 < owen1> i am writing a 10 lines proxy and it works for most sites, but for google.com i get a relative url - /logos/2012/olympics-diving-2012-hp.jpg and the request gives me Error: getaddrinfo ENOENT. http://pastebin.com/qpZRfr2a any ideas why is google different than other sites?
22:53 < owen1> 0.0.0.0:3000/www.yahoo.com works and shows me all the images.
22:53 < owen1> 0.0.0.0:3000/www.google.com doesn't show images since it can't find the relative urls.
22:54 < owen1> do i need to add http://www.google.com whenever a url start with /?
22:55 <@deltab> owen1: that'll work if www.google.com is the only site you use with it
22:56 <@deltab> owen1: did you configure it as a proxy in your browser?
22:57 < owen1> deltab: no. is that what i am suppose to do?
22:57 < yiannis> guys can you suggest a good book to start nodejs?
22:58 < owen1> yiannis: find a project u want to work on and google
22:58 <@deltab> owen1: yes
22:58 < owen1> oh
22:58 < owen1> thanks
22:59 <@deltab> owen1: otherwise the browser connects to the original sites when it has full urls (and fails with relative ones, as you've seen)
22:59 < yiannis> oh, thanks, no good books atm i guess? 
22:59 < owen1> yiannis: no and i don't think it's possible since node is moving fast
23:00 < owen1> yiannis: start listening to nodeup podcasts
23:00 < yiannis> good to know! cheers!
23:04 < owen1> what does this code do: res.setHeader('X-Ratelimit-Max', max)
23:08 < level09> I want to batch process files with nodejs (convert them using avconv) , what is a good way to save the state of the files ?
23:08 < level09> should I use redis/database ? or should I just rename files to mark them as processing 
23:31 < elguapo99> doers thefree nodejitsu plan include a mongoDB service?
23:36 < owen1> how to run mongo in the backround? mongod && doesn't work on mac from some reason
23:43 < Darkout> owen1: do you have command line tools?
23:44 < Darkout> the apple xcode package?
23:50 <@Nexxy> prettyrobots, yus
23:50 < owen1> Darkout: 'mongod &' did what i wanted
