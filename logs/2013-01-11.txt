00:09 < superjoe> niftylettuce, done.
00:09 < superjoe> he's too nifty to wilt
00:10 < niftylettuce> superjoe: haha :D
00:10 < niftylettuce> superjoe: thx for filing issues, im going to rewrite module soon :)
00:10 < niftylettuce> Nexxy: never wilt until your petals fall off
00:10 < superjoe> nice! how soon? I need it yesterday.
00:10 < niftylettuce> superjoe: sign up for mailing list https://teelaunch.com/
00:10 < niftylettuce> superjoe: my startup is sponsoring development of it
00:11 < niftylettuce> superjoe: um prob within week or two, trying to get some things organized first
00:12 < WarheadsSE> looks like this build is working too.
00:12 < WarheadsSE> WTF..
00:12 < superjoe> cool startup
00:12 < WarheadsSE> (its in v8, I blame v8, mostly)
00:12 < superjoe> niftylettuce, let me know if you need help developing. I have a bit of lee way to work on it at work as well.
00:14 < WarheadsSE> niftylettuce: interesting
00:15 < niftylettuce> superjoe: awesome, toss me an email i def need help nick@teelaunch.com
00:16 < niftylettuce> WarheadsSE: what is interesting? besides the most interesting man in the world? http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-filesystemfile.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-01-32-02-metablogapi/8054.image_5F00_thumb_5F00_35C6E986.png
00:17 < niftylettuce> ew long link for the loss
00:20 < WarheadsSE> yup
00:33 < trevnorris> bnoordhuis: dude, I can't believe how much time passing node_isolate to Undefined can speed up light weight function.
00:35 < niftylettuce> WarheadsSE: what're you up to/working on?
00:36 < cxreg> othiym23: thanks for the critique
00:36 < cxreg> i've spent a lot of time meditating on the domain stack the last month
00:37 < cxreg> i have at least one more patch i would like to submit, but it's not done yet
00:37 < WarheadsSE> niftylettuce: I work on many things
00:43 < WarheadsSE> CoverSlide: and.. this build failed.
00:44 < CoverSlide> hmm i don't know who the arm expert is anymore on this ... i know TooTallNate's done some work on it
00:45 < WarheadsSE> hes done some work, but I am not seeing where the fault is coming from, tbh, since ti is coming and going

02:06 < adrimirc> Hi I heard about node.js and I want to learn where can I learn?
02:10 < gluxon> adrimirc: http://www.nodebeginner.org/ is a good place to start.
02:10 < gluxon> adrimirc: After that, I'd recommend just reading the API. Not all of it.. unless you want to be awesome.

02:28 < stefan41> Is there a good way to run a node program such that it can trap signals (i.e. restart when it gets a -HUP, exit gracefully when it gets a TERM, and quit immediately when it gets a KILL)?
02:29 < WarheadsSE> I recall there being some events at the process level.
02:34 < stefan41> yeah, i found the stuff in process… i think maybe the question i'm looking for the answer to is more, how do i get npm (like in npm start) to pass a -HUP or a -KILL or a -TERM onto its child process
02:35 < stefan41> or, actually, a script that's running npm start…
02:35 < stefan41> (a bash script that is)
02:53 < gluxon> :O
02:53 < gluxon> New Node.js version :D
02:53  * Bergle_1 noticed that a few days ago :)
02:56 < gluxon> Bergle_1: No, 0.8.17 was just released.
02:57 < Bergle_1> ahh another
02:58 < gluxon> Hm.. an hour or two ago it seems.
02:59 < Bergle_1> uhm i got 0.8.17 yesterday 
02:59 < Bergle_1> and it has been out for a few days then
03:00 < gluxon> The third-party ppa doesn't have it yet for Debian systems.
03:01 < OTBS4Life> Hey guys, anyone know if there has been progress on getting Socket.IO working with IPv6?  I've got a question up on SO about it:  http://stackoverflow.com/q/14185370/362536
03:01 < OTBS4Life> Someone on a bug report said they got it working.
03:01 < OTBS4Life> But I can't seem to make it happen.
03:15 < WarheadsSE> ohlook, kerboom found during Debug build CoverSlide http://pastie.org/5665725
03:29 < euoia> what's going on with socket.io? 59 pull requests and 400 issues
03:30 < timeturner> socket.io has been abandoned
03:30 < timeturner> for the new and improved engine.io
03:30 < timeturner> :P
03:30 < timeturner> jk idk
03:31 < euoia> last commit was a month ago
03:31 <@mbalho> socket.io is way too big
03:32 < blazes816> what is a good alternative?
03:34 < TehShrike> isaacs: you are by fare the most prolific gister of the people I follow on github
03:34 < TehShrike> *far
04:10 < mclenithan> I am interviewing for my first REAL developer job, my skill set is straight JavaScript, node, angular, 1 year experience. What should I ask per hour?
04:10 < ckknight> mclenithan: where do you live?
04:11 < mclenithan> (Contract)
04:11 < mclenithan> Los Angelea
04:11 < mclenithan> S*
04:13 < mclenithan> I had a great interview with a company that rhymes with bed dull. They liked me and they liked my code, but the interviewer literally told me I came in too low
04:14 < ckknight> mclenithan: go higher, then
04:14 < ckknight> I dunno what to tell you, tbh
04:15 < mclenithan> No idea what a intermediate node.is makes... I came in @ 25/he. Just cause I am the project so bad
04:15 < mclenithan> I want* ( on cell app)
04:17 < mclenithan> cknight: what would you pay assuming my code is decent
04:18 < SomeoneWeird> $1/d
04:18 < SomeoneWeird> >.>
04:18 < greg5green> 25/hr is definitely too low
04:19 < mclenithan> Someoneweird: 
04:19 < mclenithan> Whoops
04:19 < SomeoneWeird> lol
04:19 < mclenithan> Cell phone irc sucks!
04:19 < mclenithan>  Haha
04:22 < mscdex> oh man something in screwed up in Buffer in node master
04:22 < mscdex> :S
04:25 < SomeoneWeird> uhoh
04:25 <@isaacs> TehShrike: yeah, i use gist as my public clipboard
04:28 < TehShrike> isaacs: since I subscribed to the RSS feed that includes everyone's gist updates, I've pulled it back to just random code that I would be interested in having other people comment on, which for me is a fairly small amount
04:28 <@isaacs> TehShrike: ah.  for me that's a lot of code :)
04:29 <@isaacs> TehShrike: typically it's specifically to get someone to comment on it :)
04:29 <@isaacs> TehShrike: usually in irc
04:29 < TehShrike> isaacs: it's a little weird, but I think it would be easier for me (as someone who subscribed to the RSS feed of all updates by people he follows on Github) to follow if you had a comment at the beginning of each gist giving some context
04:29 < TehShrike> I feel like I could learn a lot, or at least start to have an opinion, but I'm generally just dropped into a bash script or whatever without knowing what I'm looking at
04:29 <@isaacs> TehShrike: meh.
04:30 <@isaacs> TehShrike: a lot of times it's just a list of commits or something
04:30 <@isaacs> TehShrike: hang out in #libuv, the commentary is usually there :)
04:30 < TehShrike> Right, and since I've started following people, that's the sort of thing I don't put on gist (or at least, not under my main account)
04:30 <@isaacs> TehShrike: i'd recommend not following me.
04:30 < TehShrike> gists are like blog posts
04:30 < TehShrike> lol
04:30 < TehShrike> That's fair.
04:30 <@isaacs> i pollute that feed without any regard for any followers.
04:31 <@isaacs> it's like my twitter stream * 10 but even nerdier
04:31 < TehShrike> Haven't you heard? Github is a social network now! :-P
04:31 < TehShrike> But see, in your Twitter feed, I'm never grasping for context
04:31 < mscdex> hmmm or maybe it's openssl...
04:31 < TehShrike> Because when you write there, you're aware of how little context other people have, and write accordingly
04:31 < TehShrike> You know when you're writing random things, and that's fine
04:33 < TehShrike> Anyway, I'm sorry, I don't mean to be fucking with your pastebin usage or anything
04:34 < mscdex> ok i think it's openssl at fault
04:34 < TehShrike> Following people on github has been profitable for me, and your gists are the one main noise/signal factor, though I feel guilty saying it because it's just a pastebin, right?
04:35 < TehShrike> If I didn't follow people on github and know that everything that you gist shows up in the feed of Stuff You Did, I'd use gist the same way
04:35 < TehShrike> Do you drink beer isaacs?  I should buy you a beer.
04:35 < Lorentz> who doesn't drink beer?
04:36 < sohcahtoa> me
04:36 < sohcahtoa> whiskey plz
04:36 < timeturner> beer should replace water
04:36 < TehShrike> heh
04:36 < timeturner> actually vodka
04:36 < TehShrike> timeturner: but without water, you couldn't make beer!
04:36 < timeturner> good point
04:36 < timeturner> add a second tap for vodka then
04:36 < timeturner> make it as accessible as water
04:36 < timeturner> vodka tower
04:37 < timeturner> right next to the water tower'
04:37 < TehShrike> Sounds good to me
04:37 < sohcahtoa> they say it's healthy to drink 8 glasses of water a day, I don't see why vodka should be any different
04:39 < TehShrike> Need something to balance out all that water
04:44 < WarheadsSE> what are we, russia?
04:45 < WarheadsSE> (nothing against russia mind you)
04:47 < sohcahtoa> f russia
04:47 < sohcahtoa> usa usa usa usa usa
04:47 < xp_prg> got a quick question, if I put in a callback and the program sort of ends waiting for the callback, does everything defined in the program get released because it goes out of scope?
04:49 < ckknight> xp_prg: if the program ends, the OS will clear its memory out.
04:49 < xp_prg> but it doesn't end there is a callback
04:49 < xp_prg> and it is waiting for that callback
04:50 < sshaginyan> Is there anyway to convert a string to an operator? for example '-'  to -
04:50 < sohcahtoa> it's either ended or not ended there is no inbetween
04:50 < ckknight> sshaginyan: no good way.
04:51 < ckknight> sshaginyan: but I'd have an object of string-to-function mappings
04:51 < sshaginyan> ckknight: Okay what's the bad way?
04:51 < ckknight> e.g. { "-": function (x, y) { return x - y; } }
04:51 < ckknight> the bad way: function (x, op, y) { return eval("x " + op + " y"); /* also, I kill puppies */ }
04:51 < ckknight> if you use eval, you probably do.
04:56 < trevnorris> for anyone that understands the v8 api, returning Number::New() is making my function 40% slower than using Integer::New(). what's going on?
04:58 < ckknight> trevnorris: ints are faster than doubles?
04:59 < trevnorris> ckknight: but by that much? i'm tracing though v8 right now to see what's going on.
04:59 < ckknight> I don't know the internals well enough
04:59 < ckknight> are they 32 or 64-bit ints, do you know?
05:01 < trevnorris> ckknight: int32_t
05:01 < trevnorris> but that's strange. Value() returns an int64_t
05:01 < trevnorris> wonder why those would be different...
05:01 < ckknight> that's a humdinger
05:02 < trevnorris> and why can't I pass the Isolate like for Integer?!
05:03 < trevnorris> ok, sorry. rant over.
05:22 < tsihonglau> Hi, Anyone here?
05:39 < TehShrike> dshaw has an "uuh" problem
05:45 <@mbalho> ya dont say
05:46 <@Nexxy> OH IS THIS THE GOSSIP CHANNEL NOW?!
05:47 <@Nexxy> ಠ_ಠ
05:51 < TehShrike> I have a butts problem
05:58  * WarheadsSE passes TehShrike beano
06:06 < tsihonglau> Anyone here?
06:12 < TehShrike> tsihonglau: definitely not
06:29 < mulvaney> :bn
06:38 < dileep> module for resize the image,i alreadyy use the basic like imagemagick,gm etc,other then that
06:39 < dileep> anybody here
06:42 < Lorentz> imagemagick doesn't work?
06:42 < Lorentz> what's the issue if you already have imagemagick
06:42 < Lorentz> (not sure on node lib for it, but that thing's quite powerful)
06:50 < dileep> i want to upload image and resize it dynamically
07:00 < tsihonglau> it seems not to be able to send empty udp datagrams in node!!
07:24 < GreenDog> is the popularity of node.js waning? I don't hear much about it anymore
07:25 <@mbalho> yea its over
07:27 <@Nexxy> GreenDog, mbalho is correct. everyone has moved onto things like vert.x
07:27 <@Nexxy> node just wasn't enterprise enough
07:27 <@Nexxy> too much embassy, not enough enterprise
07:29 < GreenDog> hmm, as you guys are ops, i can't tell if you are being sarcastic or not
07:30 <@Nexxy> perhaps your sarcastimeter is broken
07:30 < Sly> Nexxy: <333
07:30 <@Nexxy> Sly, <3
07:30 < dileep> i want to upload image and resize it dynamically what options are there
07:31 <@Nexxy> dileep, imagemagick?
07:31 < dileep> not working
07:31 < dileep> i already use iimaemagick,gm
07:32 <@Nexxy> dileep, https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/modules#wiki-graphics
08:14 < thealphanerd> niggler: are you the same niggler from hn?
08:24 < rump> there can be only one niggler
08:46 < [AD]Turbo> hi there
09:57 < mauro___> Hello everyone, I have a pdf in "arraybuffer" format,  is there a way to print this pdf from the browser?
10:01 < isaacbw> you know the answer to that mauro___ 
10:04 < SomeoneWeird> is there a cleaner way of removing empty string from an array than arr.filter(function(e) { return !!e; }); ?
10:05 < isaacbw> that looks pretty clean
10:05 < isaacbw> it's hard to beat a one liner
10:06 < SomeoneWeird> yeah, I suppose
10:07 < isaacbw> !!e is a little cryptic though
10:10 < SomeoneWeird> yeah
10:14 < _ior> it's only cryptic if there's no comment attached :)
10:14 < _ior> with a comment like "remove empty strings" it becomes quite clear
10:34 < testingtesting12> I am starting with Node.js _ d3. I see $.extend so how do I use it in Jade?
10:37 < Clex> testingtesting12: you're not supposed to use jQuery on server side.
10:38 < testingtesting12> Clex: but is there an easy way to do this, I am just testing some thing
10:39 < Clex> Do what exactly? Something similar to jQuery's extend?
10:39 < testingtesting12> yes,
10:39 < Industrial> testingtesting12: jade is a template language. Are you sure you want to extend a class inside a template?
10:39 < testingtesting12> As of now I think yes
10:40 < Industrial> Don't mix logic and views like that :\ do the classes/extending in a .js file and pass it's outcome to a template
10:40 < testingtesting12> the thing is I am trying out d3 with node. and I do see it in a lot of examples
10:42 < Clex> testingtesting12: you can write it yourself in a few line. Also, listen to Industrial.
10:43 < Industrial> testingtesting12: have you tried d3 in the browser?
10:43 < Industrial> (without node, underscore and jquery)
10:48 < rounce^work> +1
10:54 < testingtesting12> Industrial: yes I have tried it in the browser
10:57 < tauren> I have forked a project on github, made some improvements, and submitted a pull request. This is a project that is in NPM.
10:58 < tauren> While I'm waiting for that pull request to be accepted, what's the best way to use my fork of the project in my production servers?
10:58 < tauren> On my dev box, I'm using npm link.
10:58 < rounce^work> set the version string to be a git repo
10:58 < rounce^work> *your git repo
10:58 < SomeoneWeird> (in package.json)
10:58 < tauren> Oh, cool. didn't realize that would work.
10:58 < AAA_awright> I'd just use Git
10:59 < tauren> AAA_awright: what do you mean?
10:59 < AAA_awright> Oh I see hm.
11:00 < tauren> I have an automated deploy process. Using git, I push to prod. Then the post-hook does an npm install and npm purge.
11:00 < tauren> So I don't want to do any npm linking or manual stuff on prod.
11:00 < tauren> sounds like pointing to my github repo in package.json is the best solution.
11:00 < AAA_awright> git submodules are the correct way to reference git repositories. Unfortunately npm doens't have any concept of forking or branches.
11:37 < wereHamster> what's the correct registry url for npmjs? http://isaacs.iriscouch.com/registry/ or http://isaacs.ic.ht/registry. The npmjs readme lists both :-/
11:40 < SomeoneWeird> wereHamster, https://registry.npmjs.org/
11:41 < wereHamster> ugh, what's the reason for the self-signed certificate?
11:41 < SomeoneWeird> idno
11:57 < jvanveen> hi
11:58 < jvanveen> i want to develop an npm module. whats the best way to simulate the package-in-development to be in npm modules already?
11:58 < jvanveen> like creating symlinks in npm packages or something
11:59 < substack> `npm link` or make a symlink directly
11:59 < jvanveen> substack: aha thanks!
12:06 < wereHamster> SomeoneWeird: I can not replicate from that url
12:06 < wereHamster> couchdb throws an error. Either of th etwo urls I posted works
12:06 < SomeoneWeird> dunno, then
12:12 < Deathspike> I'm looking for a way to download a file with HTTP and pipe it to a HTTP client. If I use the request library, I'm actually piping the HTTP headers too and I don't want that. What can be a good solution?
12:22 < isaacbw> Deathspike, you could just set a listener for the data event and then write to the response
12:31 < Deathspike> isaacs: This would be with http.request and not the request lib I found, I assume. The docs look promising, thanks for the pointer -- I'll play with this :)
12:45 < Deathspike> Is there a way to get the non-lower-cased headers from a http server?
12:51 < mmalecki> Deathspike: no, they don't matter.
12:51 < mmalecki> http headers are case-insensitive

13:13 < Exx2xxO> hello ! I got a problem I want to send specific data from a client using node.js to a php script on webserver. Now the problem is: I don't know how. Is there any need for a node module to send data from node to php and from php to node?
13:17 < isaacbw> whaaaat
13:17 < isaacbw> you're using node.js for the client and php on the server?
13:17 < Exx2xxO> the server is just to store data so the node clients can communicate with each other
13:17 < isaacbw> still
13:18 < isaacbw> anyway, you communicate with php servers via http requests like get and post
13:19 < isaacbw> but still
13:19 < isaacbw> dsfjdsfhsadklfjashdflkjdshf
13:20 < isaacbw> that seems so wrong
13:20 < Exx2xxO> any idea how I should do it in another way?
13:20 < cosmin> Hi guys, i'm using nodejs with websocket, for now it's working fine, what i want to do is: if there are connected two or more clients how can i know (on the server) which client sends me a message? 
13:20 < isaacbw> why do you feel like using php
13:21 < Exx2xxO> Because thats whats running on almost every webserver
13:21 < isaacbw> ad
13:21 < isaacbw> *and
13:21 < isaacbw> are you using an existing php program or something?
13:22 < Exx2xxO> no not as far as I know
13:22 < isaacbw> then maybe read more about node.js because it's intended as an alternative to php
13:22 < isaacbw> among other things
13:24 < Exx2xxO> yeah I know. The thing is : There are different clients which don't know each other but need to communicate with eachother so a webserver is the "enter point"
13:25 < Exx2xxO> and to garantee that this works on almost every server I'm in need to use php
13:27 < isaacbw> node can be installed on virtually every server
13:27 < isaacbw> at least every non-windows server
13:27 < Zelest> virtually every sever.. or every virtual server? ;-)
13:27 < Zelest> server*
13:28 < isaacbw> virtually every virtual server
13:28 < Exx2xxO> if you got the rights yes but if you only got webspace then you can't use node (can't run it ;))
13:28 < isaacbw> you mean like on a shared web host?
13:28 < Exx2xxO> yep
13:28 < isaacbw> welp
13:29 < gildean> cosmin: add something to the connection object to recognize the client, and for example put all the connections to a pool-like object which you can then traverse for the specific client
13:34 < Exx2xxO> Hmm I still don't know how to use the http request to send data to a php script.
13:37 < cosmin> thank you gildean, i will give him a try
13:43 < WarheadsSE> well, looks like I had to move to system v8 again for the moment CoverSlide Nexxy isaacs .. darn v8 keep glitching in it's internals when bundled. (ARM)
13:49 < gildean> cosmin: here's a simple example where i did just that: https://github.com/gildean/ServerInfo/blob/master/server.js
13:49 < cosmin> ok, now i'm looking at that
13:56 < Deathspike> isaacs: Would you mind looking over this snippet http://pastebin.com/HJ2t55aU please? This does seem to transfer the first chunk to the connecting client but each following chunk does not appear to arrive. Did I do something horribly wrong?
13:56 < wereHamster> isaacs: what is the correct url to mirror the registry? The npmjs.org.git readme mentions http://isaacs.iriscouch.com/registry/ and http://isaacs.ic.ht/registry, and somebody also suggested  https://registry.npmjs.org/, but that doens't work (couchdb fails to replicate from that url)
13:57 < devnill> So i have a url in a string. Whats the best way to parse it?
13:57 < dab`> http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/url.html
13:57 < Gottox> devnill: http://nodejs.org/api/url.html the url module.
14:02 < devnill> i've tried the url module dab` and Gottox, but its crashing
14:02 < devnill> let me post the string:
14:03 < devnill> console.log(url.parse("http://www.google.com/url",true));
14:04 < dab`> what's the crash error?
14:04 < devnill> Object has no error parse
14:05 < Gottox> devnill: you have to include url first
14:05 < devnill> i do?
14:05 < dab`> oh good point
14:05 < devnill> url = require('url');
14:05 < Gottox> var url=require("url")
14:05 < devnill> yeah, i have that at the top
14:05 < Gottox> and make sure, it is not hidden by another variable.
14:05 < devnill> i'll try reinstalling hte module
14:06 < cosmin> Thank you again gildean, your example helped me a lot
14:06 < devnill> its definately within the scope
14:06 < devnill> i think?
14:06 < Gottox> what's the output of console.log(url)?
14:06 < dab`> was going to ask that next xD
14:06 < devnill> it i copy and paste the url.parse to right below the include it works
14:06 < devnill> so maybe it is a scoping issue?
14:07 < devnill> OH
14:07 < devnill> i see
14:07 < dab`> are you overriding the value?
14:07 < Gottox> :D
14:07 < Gottox> js is a bitch sometimes.
14:07 < devnill> its a naming conflict, i'm using jsdom and it is
14:07 < dab`> aw
14:07 < devnill> jsdom uses a url key as well
14:08 < devnill> I feel stupid now :P
14:13 < WarheadsSE> scope happens >.<
14:17 < sam__> I have made a fork of a repo on github and changed the package.json to use a different version of a module.. However when I then run npm install on my fork I can see it pulling in the old module
14:17 < Kakera> how do I handle "socket hang up" for an http request?
14:18 < manuelbieh> var port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
14:19 < manuelbieh> well, how can process.env.PORT differ from the port I have my server listening to?
14:19 < manuelbieh> why would I want to assign process.env.PORT to a "port" variable?
14:19 < sam__> isnt that just an environment variable? like you could set a port environment variable to anything 
14:20 < manuelbieh> sure
14:20 < sam__> to make it more secure so no one can see what port its listening on maybe?
14:20 < manuelbieh> maybe so that's easier to change the port?! i dont know
14:21 < manuelbieh> app.listen(3000);
14:21 < manuelbieh> -> process.env.PORT == 3000
14:22 < manuelbieh> i could also do app.listen(port)
14:22 < manuelbieh> but then process.env.PORT is also always 3000
14:22 < manuelbieh> because before calling the .listen() function process.env.PORT is initially undefined, so 3000 is used
14:23 < manuelbieh> i dont understand that but i have already seen that several times
14:31 < dab`> was it javascript that didn't require the ; endings?
14:32 < Gottox> yes.
14:32 < dab`> hmk. Does node enforce it at all?
14:32 < WarheadsSE> nope
14:32 < Gottox> with some very nasty consequences.
14:32 < WarheadsSE> lots of linters complain though
14:32 < dab`> xD
14:32 < dab`> I add them out of habbit 
14:33 < Gottox> return\n{foo:bar} is different from return { foo:bar }
14:33 < WarheadsSE> Yeah, I have to force myself not to use them
14:33 < WarheadsSE> well, duh
14:33 < dab`> but if linters complain, that basically answers the question I was getting around to :>
14:34 < isaacbw> there's no good reason not to use semicolons
14:34 < isaacbw> and plenty of good reasons to use them
14:36  * WarheadsSE drops the pole
14:37 < WarheadsSE> not having this debate
14:39 < dab`> lol
15:00 < Iszak> no need to add commas, tools can do that for you.
15:00 < Iszak> i mean.. semi-colans
15:01 < isaacbw> eh....
15:02 < isaacbw> I don't understand how people can be so lazy that they won't type one extra key
15:02 < isaacbw> it's like being too lazy to flush the toilet
15:02 < Iszak> but do you flush the toilet 100's of times in a day?
15:02 < Iszak> I certainly don't.
15:03 < Iszak> at the end of the day, I don't really care if people use semicolons or not, personal preference.
15:03 < dab`> :P
15:03 < dab`> kinda like if they use node or not
15:03 < dab`> :>
15:03 < Iszak> exactly.
15:04 < Iszak> It's when they start trying to force their views on you is when they over step the line.
15:04 < wwicks> some prefer to use the toilet 100 times a dat
15:04 < dab`> :o
15:04 < wwicks> *day
15:04 < dab`> WHen sick, I know I use it at least in the 20s
15:05 < wwicks> …and I HOPE they flush!

15:31 < isaacbw> what do you mean by monitoring
15:31 < isaacbw> watching for updates?
15:31 < dab`> auto updating would bad imo, what if the module does some behavior/api changing update? Breaks your application :(

15:48 < jmar777> emkei: it is
15:48 < jmar777> emkei: http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html#statics
15:48 < isaacbw> yea it's the same list Iszak 
15:49 < Iszak> isaacbw can we standard the naming so it's - or _
15:49 < Iszak> it does my OCD in.
15:49 < isaacbw> haha
15:49 < isaacbw> my preference is -

15:49 < Iszak> I have no preference, I just want standardisation.
15:50 < jmar777> that's just my two_cents, though

16:15 < Deathspike> Is there a way to flush headers in a http server?
16:17 < bnoordhuis> Deathspike: res.end() or ?
16:18 < bnoordhuis> Deathspike: there's also res._send('') but that's an unsupported hack
16:18 < Deathspike> bnoordhuis: I don't want to end the response, I just want to flush headers until my response is done.
16:19 < Deathspike> That does not seem to work either.
16:22 < exit2> What's the opinion on tab vs. spaces in the Node community?  I know 2 spaces is usually used for indenting, but is it a tab converted to two spaces or actually two spaces? @_@
16:32 < baudehlo> exit2: like any coding community, there's no consensus.
16:32 < baudehlo> but anyone who uses hard tabs should be shot :)
16:32 < exit2> I agree
16:32 < exit2> I was working with this PHP guy and he was arguing how a tab takes up less space in memory so it should be used
16:33 < baudehlo> please fire him.
16:33 < exit2> was a dude I was working with at a local startup
16:33 < exit2> needless to say I don't work with him anymore heh
16:34 < exit2> He also put opening braces on the next line
16:35 < baudehlo> I do that for long if () conditions.
16:36 < exit2> well his code ends up looking like this http://pastie.org/5668957 :|
16:37 < baudehlo> it's a valid style. I happen to not like it, but it's valid.
16:38 < exit2> Right
16:39 < baudehlo> There's a bunch of different styles listed here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style

16:50 < bnoordhuis> baudehlo: if you're an old guy, 2 spaces should be a treat. less eye muscle to flex
16:51 < bnoordhuis> i used to use tabs actually but on a 27" screen that becomes taxing
16:51 < baudehlo> yeah the linux kernel uses tabs, right?
16:51 < bnoordhuis> it does
16:52 < baudehlo> tbh whatever you end up using, consistency is key.

17:53 < trevnorris> is there a preference to using Local over Handle with v8?
17:53 < fbbdev> I'm learning to use node.js with express and I don't understand how can I keep the response open until an async function (fs.readFile or mongoose query) is completed. The request handler terminates before the callback is called.
17:55 < bnoordhuis> trevnorris: yes. Local roots a handle in the local HandleScope
17:55 < Deathspike> fbbdev: Just.. don't close it? You are responsible for calling res.send or whatever.
17:55 < trevnorris> bnoordhuis: cool. thanks.
17:57 < Deathspike> bnoordhuis: _send checks data.length to be 0 and aborts. :P
17:57 < Deathspike> bnoordhuis: Oh wait, it shouldn't do that.
17:57 < fbbdev> Deathspike: so if I don't call res.send (or similar methods) in the handler the connection will never be closed until it reaches timeout?
17:58 < Deathspike> fbbdev: Absolutely correct.
17:58 < fbbdev> Deathspike: ok, thank you
17:58 < bnoordhuis> Deathspike: res._send('') <- the empty string does it
17:59 < Deathspike> fbbdev: This bit, while implementation is irrelevent, waits for MySQL to give an image and pipes it to the request -- http://pastebin.com/TtzDkfT3
17:59 < Deathspike> So everything works like that.
17:59 < Deathspike> bnoordhuis: Yeah indeed, it pushes headers onto writeRaw and should sent at that point. Strange stuff going on here, unless it buffers internally somewhere further.
18:00 < superjoe> I am looking for a templating engine with 2 requirements: 1. ability to get a list of possible substitutions that exist in a template. 2. "layout" / "extend" functionality
18:01 < Deathspike> superjoe: substitutions?
18:01 < superjoe> Deathspike, what is the main point of templates?
18:02 < Industrial> superjoe: check out nodetoolbox.org
18:02 < Industrial> it has a category on templates
18:03 < superjoe> Industrial, site is down
18:03 < Industrial> in short: probably jade, hogan.js or ejs is what you want
18:03 < superjoe> ejs does not have what I want
18:03 < superjoe> in fact, it's impossible for ejs to have what I want and I can prove it with math
18:03 < isaacbw> substitutions is an uncommon thing to say with templates
18:03 < isaacbw> nonstandard terminology
18:03 < superjoe> what is the standard
18:04 < isaacbw> well I have no idea what you mean
18:04 < superjoe> isaacbw, what is the main point of templates?
18:04 < isaacbw> why do you keep asking that question
18:04 < superjoe> I find it hard to believe that nobody understands what I mean when I say "substitutions" in the context of templates
18:05 < superjoe> it's the fucking main feature
18:05 < Industrial> so all template languages do that, what is your point?
18:05 < superjoe> <superjoe> I am looking for a templating engine with 2 requirements: 1. ability to get a list of possible substitutions that exist in a template. 2. "layout" / "extend" functionality
18:06 < isaacbw> if you find yourself being misunderstood, maybe take a step back and try to explain
18:06 < isaacbw> instead of becoming aggressive
18:06 < superjoe> agreed.
18:06 < superjoe> sorry for getting frustrated.
18:06 < superjoe> I want a function that I give my template to, and it returns a list of the context that it would have needed to successfully fill out the template
18:08 < superjoe> this is a function that can only be done correctly by the template parser itself
18:09 < fbbdev> expressjs question: what happens if I don't call next() in a middleware?
18:09 < superjoe> fbbdev, request hangs forever
18:10 < isaacbw> it just means the server doesn't move down the middleware list
18:10 < fbbdev> exactly what I need! :-)
18:10 < isaacbw> so you don't call next() when you want a response to be the end-point
18:11 < Deathspike> superjoe: I don't think there is any with this particular feature.
18:12 < Deathspike> superjoe: Mainly because something doesn't have to be there, for example, what if you have an if statement that works on a var that may or may not be there to hide or show content.
18:12 < fbbdev> Do you know a good async data validation and sanitization library?
18:12 < superjoe> Deathspike, then I want both - the substitutions from both sides of the if statement
18:12 < superjoe> I want a list of all possible substitutions
18:13 < superjoe> it's possible to provide this feature. if there is no templating library that provides it, I will build it. but i'd rather not reinvent the wheel.
18:13 < Draggor> How do I shut down express and let node exit gracefully?
18:13 < Deathspike> superjoe: I don't think you'll find this feature in any templating engine for a dynamic language such as this. Why would you event have a need for a feature that inspects a template to know what has to go in?
18:13 < Deathspike> Template engines generally just ignore something if you don't have it.
18:13 < superjoe> Deathspike, so that I can build a tool that lets you preview emails
18:14 < Deathspike> superjoe: You can just call render() on the engine and generate a preview?
18:14 < superjoe> Draggor, start the app with the http or https module, and then call server.close
18:14 < Draggor> Ah, wonderful, thanks
18:14 < superjoe> Deathspike, how do I know what context variables to give the template
18:15 < superjoe> you would have me store this information in 2 places
18:15 < superjoe> that's not as good as 1
18:17 < Deathspike> superjoe: I'm confused. You just want to generate a preview, so you could perform the rendering with whatever the user provided and output that. Is this NOT what you want?
18:19 < superjoe> Deathspike, given a template, I should be able to render a preview with editable dummy data

18:22 < emilsedgh> i've written a node module for parsing and generating PDU's. however, its not async. does it really have to be async? do you guys recommend it?
18:22 < superjoe> emilsedgh, yes, it has to be async.
18:22 < superjoe> what is a pdu anyway
18:22 <@mbalho> i dont know what a PDU is but if there is one big enough to not fit in memory then you should make it a streaming parser
18:22 < emilsedgh> it does no IO, just a set of basic string manipulations. i personally cannot see how asyncing it would help, but im kind of a newbie in this regard. i'd appreciate help
18:23 < superjoe> emilsedgh, oh, if it does no IO it does not have to be async
18:23 < emilsedgh> pdu is the format your cellphone uses to contact smsc.
18:23 < niggler> unless you plan on manipulating war and peace, async is not needed
18:23 < superjoe> if it's ridiculously CPU intensive you may consider child process forking and sending the results to the parent
18:23 < Deathspike> superjoe: And the editable is going to be generated from the template variables, correct?
18:24 < emilsedgh> cool. no its not very cpu intensive.
18:24 < superjoe> emilsedgh, no async then. in node.js you typically do not introduce *new* async things, you mostly just bubble async things up the stack
18:25 < superjoe> Deathspike, exactly. makes sense right?
18:25 < emilsedgh> i've also written a module i call modem.js which gives a high level api for using an AT modem (sending/receiving messages) and eecuting USSD sessions.
18:25 < Deathspike> superjoe: It does now.
18:25 < emilsedgh> s/eecuting/executing/
18:25 < superjoe> sorry I got frustrated.
18:25 < superjoe> Deathspike, do you know a template module that has these 2 features I want?
18:26 < Deathspike> superjoe: None have it as far as I know, and the only template engine I am really familiar with is one I wrote myself (Gaikan), which is pretty easy to modify to create a context of used variables.

18:48 < em> Hello
18:49 < em> Is learning node.js different than learning javascript?
18:49 < trevnorris> em: you mean javascript for the browser?
18:50 < trevnorris> em: for example, javascript on the browser would have a DOM API where node doesn't.
18:50 < bradleymeck> em, node.js is a set of built in libraries in the same way the DOM is built into browsers, Javascript is the language used to access those libraries in both cases. Learning Javascript will let you use the libraries effectively in both cases
18:50 < Industrial> em: yes it is. javascript is the language. Nodejs is the platform to create server.

19:02 < boya> Beginner here with node.  I wanted to get my feet wet with User Management / Authentication (with mongo).  Any recommendations on tutorials / guides / examples?
19:03 < exit2> boya: have you tried mongoose?
19:03 < boya> I have not … should I google that for a tutorial?
19:03 < exit2> boya: http://mongoosejs.com/
19:04 < exit2> boya: I've used it a bit and it's been fun
19:04 < boya> OK I'll take a look
19:04 < boya> Does that do sessions / etc.?
19:06 < exit2> boya: what kind of stuff are you trying to do
19:09 < dschatz> Are there any standard webapp benchmarks for nodejs? 
19:10 < Exx2xxO> Hello ! I got a problem: Trying this (http://martinsikora.com/nodejs-and-websocket-simple-chat-tutorial) cloud9 and firebug says "$ is not defined" how can I solve this ?
19:12 < Exx2xxO> e.g. :  var content = $('#content'); --> "$ is not defined"
19:12 < gildean> Exx2xxO: add jquery
19:15 < dschatz> I'm looking for a standard webapp benchmark for nodejs. I need something with database/memcache use. Does such a thing exist?
19:17 < Exx2xxO> and another question does anybody know cloud9 and how to install there npm packages? Because in my case it's loading and loading but does nothing
19:20 < MiTeePingWin> Afternoon!
19:20 < MiTeePingWin> I could use some help getting Node.js installed on a NAS
19:21 < CoverSlide> dscape: huh?
19:24 < MiTeePingWin> Anybody available? Could use some assistance
19:25 < FunnyLookinHat> MiTeePingWin, I don't think we understand your question...
19:25 < MiTeePingWin> I'm having problems compiling the latest node.js
19:26 < FunnyLookinHat> What OS? Distribution? Etc. ?  
19:27 < MiTeePingWin> Optware (Linkstation NAS). Compiling an old version 0.4.11 works but gives me errors. Any later versions 0.8 and I get "No acceptable C compiler found"
19:27 < MiTeePingWin> Using gcc: /opt/bin/gcc
19:27 < CoverSlide> hmm
19:27 < FunnyLookinHat> updates - rebooting
19:27 < MI6> joyent/node: isaacs created tag v0.9.6 - http://git.io/MURpRg
19:28 < MiTeePingWin> Reboot between git checkouts?
19:28 < MI6> joyent/node: isaacs master * 9a4a39f : Now working on 0.9.7 (+2 more commits) - http://git.io/w1saRw
19:29 < MI6> joyent/node: isaacs v0.8 * 4c9de9d : blog: release v0.9.6 - http://git.io/C0YeqA
19:29 < CoverSlide> MiTeePingWin: maybe try CC=/opt/bin/gcc ./configure
19:30 < MiTeePingWin> And you're a genius, thank you  :)
19:33 < wwicks> CoverSlide: Remember that issue I was having with crypto? https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/4568
19:33 < wwicks> That was a pain
19:38 < guidocalvano> hey guys... I was wondering about what you could do when something on your event queue crashes
19:38 < guidocalvano> is it possible to detect this with some event listener and recover?
19:38 < acidjazz> how do i npm install a module like not in just ./node_modules.. but in a bin folder in my path
19:38 < acidjazz> or a globally used bin folder
19:39 < ngoldman> npm install -g <module_name>
19:39 < CoverSlide> oh wow nice find
19:39 < ngoldman> might have to use sudo
19:39 < acidjazz> ah --global
19:39 < acidjazz> ah -g
19:39 < acidjazz> thanks
19:39 < bradleymeck> guidocalvano: look at domains
19:40 < trevnorris> isaacs: indutny added new class methods to include/v8.h that allow for the Isolate to be passed. But didn't include it for Number::New().
19:40 <@isaacs> trevnorris: /join #libuv plz
19:40 < trevnorris> isaacs: oh, thanks.
19:41 < guidocalvano> bradleymeck: looks awesome, but it states that it is still unfinished, are you aware of an eta?
19:43 < bradleymeck> guidocalvano: itll be experimental for a long time probably as edge cases are ironed out, its functional right now
19:43 < ben_alman> does node.js have any kind of method_missing?
19:43 < guidocalvano> bradleymeck: say for one year or something?
19:43 < bradleymeck> guidocalvano: that or you could just do a process.on('uncaughtException') for now, bit overkill and hard to detect
19:43 < bradleymeck> guidocalvano: probably
19:44 < guidocalvano> tnx
19:44 < bradleymeck> ben_alman: the way JS works, nope, --harmony and Proxy.createFunction exist but thats not always available
19:44 < ben_alman> ya ok
19:44 < ben_alman> figured as much
19:45 < bradleymeck> ben_alman: basically you cant do method missing in most engines because `.` does an actual lookup rather than something like ruby where its a virtual lookup since method_missing was existing before people started to optimize it to heck
19:46 < ben_alman> yeah
19:46 < ben_alman> i'm sure proxies will be fun, eventually
19:52 < guidocalvano> bradleymeck: can domains also detect an infinite loop on the event queue (i.e. when something takes longer than x millis)
19:53 < bradleymeck> guidocalvano: no, use a timer
19:53 < styol> >> var f = 'are short keys worth the loss of readability '; var foo = 'or does it not really matter for performance or otherwise?'; f + foo;
19:53 < purr> styol: (string) 'are short keys worth the loss of readability or does it not really matter for performance or otherwise?'
19:55 < Determinist> anybody using domains in production yet or would that be risky?
19:55 < bradleymeck> Determinist: we use it but for production for now avoid nesting them
19:55 < bradleymeck> so you have to be a bit careful
19:55 < Determinist> bradleymeck: that should be fine. ever touched process.domain?
19:56 < bradleymeck> I don't believe in thread local state
19:56 < Determinist> bradleymeck: believe it or not, sometimes you need context (e.g. when logging stuff together with the request ID)
19:56 < Determinist> believe in it*
19:56 < bradleymeck> pass by args, its a bit more verbose, but it wont ever hit shared cache issues
19:57 < Determinist> bradleymeck: sounds great, cept what happens when an error occurs in some module?
19:57 < C0deMaver1ck> does anybody have an SSL cert issuer they like and is reasonably priced?
19:57 < C0deMaver1ck> that also covers wildcard subdomains
19:57 < bradleymeck> also use dependency injection, events, something like understudy if you need async
19:57 < bradleymeck> Determinist: ^
19:57 < bradleymeck> basically make it modular instead of the evils of pure blackbox
19:58 < Determinist> bradleymeck: sure, that's great, but again, it's not my code and i'd rather not maintain custom patched versions of mongoose, restify and a bunch of other modules
19:58 < bradleymeck> Determinist: don't patch, use those
19:58 < bradleymeck> never change another person's code
19:58 < Determinist> bradleymeck: reading, brb, thanks
19:59 < Determinist> bradleymeck: can't find understudy... are you sure that's the name? :)
20:00 < bradleymeck> https://github.com/bmeck/understudy
20:00 < TechnoCat> anyone used node-http-proxy?
20:00 < bradleymeck> look at the http-app example for a bit more complex example
20:00 < Determinist> bradleymeck: found it, sorry :)
20:00 < livinded> TechnoCat: is that the nodejitsu one that supports websockets?
20:00 < cronopio_> TechnoCat: yes
20:00 < TechnoCat> livinded: yes indeed
20:01 < livinded> TechnoCat: I used it once. It held up pretty wel
20:01 < livinded> well*
20:01 < cronopio_> TechnoCat: how can I help you?
20:01 < TechnoCat> just to clarify, this would enable me to have all my websites on port 80, but then i could redirect to differnet ports for different node instances?
20:01 < emilsedgh> how can i detect if im running in browser or node?
20:02 < livinded> emilsedgh: check if window exists
20:02 < emilsedgh> isnt that a bit hackish?
20:02 < Determinist> bradleymeck: looks pretty convoluted, tbh
20:02 < bradleymeck> Determinist: sure
20:02 < livinded> emilsedgh: it works...
20:03 < geNAZt> hiho
20:03 < Determinist> bradleymeck: and it doesn't cover a few things. what happens if an error occurs outside of your code and you need some context?
20:03 < emilsedgh> yeah, thanks livinded.
20:04 < bradleymeck> fall back to the domain catching it: https://github.com/nodejitsu/module-smith/blob/master/lib/builder.js#L63
20:04 < cronopio_> TechnoCat: yes
20:04 < Determinist> bradleymeck: not to mention there's something pretty ugly about breaking the clear separation between your model and your controller layers which this promotes
20:04 < cronopio_> TechnoCat: also you can redirect to sites outside of your server
20:04 < bradleymeck> its very clear about that, painfully so
20:04 < TechnoCat> cronopio_: thanks for the verification.
20:05 < cronopio_> TechnoCat: no problem, ask here or in #nodejitsu if you have problems
20:06 < bradleymeck> Determinist: how does it combine controller and model, it never even talks about model
20:07 < Determinist> bradleymeck: if I was to use that, I'd have to use this kind of flow all the way down to the model just to have something simple like... logging from the model and having the request ID in that log line
20:08 < bradleymeck> Sure, but if you are associating your request ID and your model you are doing something crazy. Separate the concerns
20:10 < motaro> I'm developing with appjs on a OSX and currently it only supports 32bit 'NodeJs', I installed sqlite3 module, but now that I try to run it I get an error of wrong architecture for sqlite3. Is there a way to tell npm to compile the 32bit version instead.
20:15 < Deathspike> Is there an easy way to detect if a string is a IP?
20:18 < cellvia> split using "." and see if theres 4, then do a check on each of the returned array to make sure its a number and less than 255 
20:18 < cellvia> if any fails then its not an ip
20:18 < cellvia> less than or equal*
20:19 < geNAZt> only v4 or also v6 adresses ?
20:20 < baudehlo> net.isIP()
20:20 < CoverSlide> function isIpv4(str){return str.split('.').every(function(x){return x < 255})}
20:20 < baudehlo> net.isIPv4()
20:20 < cellvia> CoverSlide, that would pass 1.1.1.1.1.1 tho
20:21 < CoverSlide> oh true
20:21 < cellvia> return str.split('.').every(function(x){return x < 255}) && str.length === 4
20:21 < cellvia>  maybe?
20:22 < cellvia> er str.split('.').length
20:22 < baudehlo> cellvia:  what's wrong with using the core functions for this?
20:22 < cellvia> oh nothing
20:22 < cellvia> nothing at all
20:22 < cellvia> just having fun
20:24 < trevnorris> isaacs: and fwiw `args[n]->ToTrue() : false ? true` is 50% faster than `!args[n]->BooleanValue()` if the argument is undefined.
20:25 < guidocalvano> bradleymeck: can domains prevent the server from crashing after a type error?i.e var a = null ; a.b = 5 ; ?
20:26 < bradleymeck> any error that is run within it will be caught
20:26 < MI6> joyent/node: Fedor Indutny master * d22bd9e : deps: update v8 to 3.15.11.7 - http://git.io/Y289Ig
20:28 < guidocalvano> bradleymeck: then what did I do wrong here? http://pastebin.com/vh7A7w7X
20:29 < geNAZt> your object a is null
20:29 < geNAZt> you cant add properties to a null object
20:30 < guidocalvano> geNAZt: I kind of got that... but why does the domain not catch the error?
20:30 < bradleymeck> guidocalvano: use nextTick, /me digs for docs
20:31 < geNAZt> because it has no try and catch ?
20:32 < motaro> Let me put it in another way how can install a module forcing 32bit?
20:34 < bradleymeck> npm i --dest-cpu=x86 ?
20:35 < geNAZt> cellvia: if u build a regex version of the ipv4 validator it is faster then the core
20:35 < geNAZt> lol
20:35 < geNAZt> http://hastebin.com/xecelomevi.js
20:35 < cellvia> yeah?
20:35 < geNAZt> net.isIP: 861 ms
20:35 < geNAZt> isIPv4: 1331 ms
20:35 < geNAZt> isIPv4Regex: 711 ms
20:36 < cellvia> submit it
20:37 < geNAZt> as a bug ?
20:37 < devnill> I'm working with an array and want to delete items from it. How can i do this and not end up with a million null values?
20:38 < MI6> joyent/node: Ben Noordhuis master * 8018113 : v8: remove optimization switches  Remove compiler switches from $(TOPLEVE - http://git.io/q1xWkw
20:38 < geNAZt> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice
20:38 < cellvia> slice? 
20:38 < cellvia> or splice?
20:39 < MiTeePingWin> Hello, I'm getting an error on Optware while compiling node.js: "flock: command not found" is there an alternative?
20:39 < cellvia> splice might be better
20:39 < devnill> so my arrayslice(3,3) would remove the third only?
20:39 < cellvia> its explicitly for removing items from an array or replacing them
20:40 < devnill> explicitly removing
20:40 < devnill> Its a list of url's that my bot is examining
20:40 < cellvia> yes, so splice
20:40 < devnill> and I'm using array.length to control the number of pages its looking at
20:40 < bradleymeck> MiTee can you not install `flock`?
20:41 < cellvia> splice(3,1) will go to the 3rd item and remove it
20:41 < MiTeePingWin> I'm not seeing flock in my list of packages (ipkg)
20:41 < cellvia> er, 3rd index
20:41 < cellvia> 4th item
20:41 < devnill> right
20:41 < CoverSlide> what OS is Optware
20:42 < devnill> that's perfect, thanks
20:42 < CoverSlide> MiTeePingWin: flock is part of my util-linux package
20:42 < CoverSlide> see if you have something similar to that
20:43 < MiTeePingWin> util-linux-ng seems to have flock -- Thanks!
20:44 < exit2> friday.js
20:45 < MiTeePingWin> Got another error: undefined reference to `__sync_val_compare_and_swap_4' collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

20:47 < MiTeePingWin> Yes
20:47 < MiTeePingWin> Trying to install Node in a Buffalo Linkstation NAS (Optware)
20:48 < CoverSlide> MiTeePingWin: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9329020/undefined-reference-to-sync-val-compare-and-swap-4-error-at-compilation-usi
20:48 < CoverSlide> the googles are kind
20:49 < geNAZt> which os do you  have running on that nas ?
20:49 < geNAZt> ( i have a livestation running with freenas and node )
20:50 < MiTeePingWin> Twonky maybe? Or Squeezebox. Whichever came with the Optware package -- Not too linux savvy  :(
20:53 < geNAZt> on which state you get the error ?
20:53 < geNAZt> configure ?
20:53 < MiTeePingWin> No, on make
20:53 < MiTeePingWin> Can I use a different compiler other than gcc?
20:53 < geNAZt> you can use another version
20:55 < trevnorris> MiTeePingWin: yeah. I use clang.
20:55 < geNAZt> my nas has a gcc v4.2.3 package on it
20:55 < geNAZt> and it compiles fine
20:55 < MiTeePingWin> Going to try the newer gcc... Found out I'm a bit behind
20:55 < MiTeePingWin> Good news: I'm learning a lot today, hah
20:56 < MiTeePingWin> Mine's v4.2.3 as well. Going to try 4.7
20:56 < CoverSlide> http://goo.gl/6s1ax
20:56 < geNAZt> there is a ipkg for 4.7 oO ?
20:57 < MiTeePingWin> Hah!
20:57 -!- mode/#Node.js [+o piscisaureus_] by ChanServ
20:57 < MiTeePingWin> No, there isn't an ipkg for 4.7. And there isn't an ipkg for clang
20:58 < kamoricks> My db-mysql package is crashing in native code. Does anyone have experience with it?
20:58 < trevnorris> isaacs: you still have you Doxyfile posted somewhere? one you mentioned on the mailing list doesn't exist.
20:59 < CoverSlide> kamoricks: it's an old package, probably fucks up with newer node versions
21:00 < kamoricks> CoverSlide: I'm running node 0.6.19. What's the reccomended mysql database package for that version?
21:00 < CoverSlide> which is all the better, since felixge's mysql is fast, and it's native JS so you don't have to worry about errors in the C code
21:01 < CoverSlide> wow the author seems to be big into lithium now
21:01 < CoverSlide> I'd switch to felix's anyway
21:01 < kamoricks> Okay, I'll switch. Thanks.
21:04 < MiTeePingWin> No package to update gcc...
21:05 < cxreg> othiym23: not sure if you noticed, mranney is not maintaining node_redis anymore
21:05 < cxreg> https://github.com/mranney/node_redis/issues/358
21:05 < CoverSlide> the redis protocol is fairly simple, and probably not due to change anytime soon
21:06 < CoverSlide> the only real thing to update would be the commands
21:06 < CoverSlide> which i think is automated anyway
21:06 < cxreg> uh... what?  there's over 20 pending pull requests and a ton of bugs
21:06 < cxreg> it badly needs a real maintainer
21:07 < CoverSlide> oh
21:07 < CoverSlide> alrighty
21:07 < cxreg> othiym23: also, i think there might be a bug in your PR.  i think it may want to .exit the caught domain
21:07 < CoverSlide> i tend to speak before i read
21:10 < niggler> cxreg make your own
21:10 < niggler> or become that maintainer
21:10 < MiTeePingWin> geNAZt: Which version of node did you compile?

21:20 < ThePrimeMedian> im building an API with nodejs and expressjs, I can see the elapsed time it took for a request in the console, using logger('dev'), is there a req. or res. that will tell me that information, without me having to start putting timestamps everywhere myself?
21:20 < geNAZt> now i compile v0.8.17
21:20 < geNAZt> and i have compiled 0.8.15

21:50 < alex____> hi all
21:50 < Appineer> hello
21:50 < exit2> hello
21:50 < alex____> somebody known howto get ping (ICMP) in node.js ?
21:51 < alex____> i see in npm about ping modules but ALL its work as wrapper via Linux ping
21:51 < exit2> alex____: just a normal ping?
21:51 < alex____> yes
21:51 < exit2> alex____: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4737130/how-to-ping-from-a-node-js-app
21:52 < exit2> try that maybe
21:52 < alex____> already read it
21:52 < exit2> didn't work?
21:52 < jbpros> is there a recommended way of checking if a node process was process.fork()ed from another one?
21:52 < CoverSlide>  < exit2> try that maybe
21:52 < CoverSlide> 13:48 < alex____> already read it
21:52 < alex____> no - I'm need check other site
21:53 < exit2> CoverSlide: @_@
21:53 < kamoricks> It'd have to be something native. Suprised there's not something for raw socket access.
21:53 < CoverSlide> sorry my mouse acts wierd sometimes
21:53 < alex____> more right - IP
21:53 < CoverSlide> it's not that surprising
21:53 < exit2> I thought it was a troll heh
21:53 < kamoricks> CoverSlide: Suprises me.
21:53 < CoverSlide> node only has modules for TCP/UDP
21:54 < alex____> why check process.fork() if I can use process API for do it.
21:54 < CoverSlide> if you want ICMP something else native has to be written 
21:54 < kamoricks> CoverSlide: Right... Exposing BSD sockets wouldn't be that terrible, would it?
21:54 < alex____> Im known about it - but maybe already somebody implement it :)
21:54 < CoverSlide> but the usefulness of ICMP is debateable
21:55 < kamoricks> Right. But it would ease the implementation of ICMP, or SCTP, or APPLETALK...
21:55  * kamoricks adds it to his list-of-things-to-do.
21:55 < CoverSlide> yes, well the number of people using TCP, UDP probably trumps all the people who want the other protocols
21:55 < alex____> Im have very old code for PHP and Java for sending ICMP packet type, but I can't reproduce this code in node
21:55 < CoverSlide> that and the maintainability
21:55 < alex____> Im use ofter UDP dgram
21:56 < kamoricks> CoverSlide: Not arguing that at all.
21:56 < CoverSlide> i mean, unix datagram sockets were dropped a while ago because noone wanted to maintain them
21:56 < CoverSlide> and too few people actually used them
21:56 < kamoricks> CoverSlide: So.. the package was lacking a maintainer?
21:57 < CoverSlide> not a package, from core
21:57 < kamoricks> Okay.
21:58 < CoverSlide> technnically you can make whatever you want from userland. you want ICMP sockets, go right ahead and write the bindings, but don't expect them in core
22:00 < alex____> Why node maintainer don't implement all protocols in core? maybe libuv can't support it?
22:00 < alex____> Im think so need implement socket bindings for node :)
22:01 < CoverSlide> yeah writing C packages is a fickle mistress, especially if you want to support multiple platforms
22:01 < deoxxa1> gentlemen: https://github.com/deoxxa/legobox
22:01 < deoxxa1> opinions?
22:02 < CoverSlide> the support probably would be on the libuv level
22:02 < deoxxa1> (it's a console UI toolkit thing)
22:02 < CoverSlide> and they have their hands full working on that as it is
22:02 < CoverSlide> interesting
22:02 < CoverSlide> does example go through everything?
22:03 < deoxxa1> everything there is right now, yeah
22:03 < deoxxa1> which isn't a whole lot of stuff
22:03 < CoverSlide> ok cloning
22:04 < deoxxa1> uses a couple of other terminal-related libraries i've worked on over the last few days: https://github.com/fknsrs/jetty/blob/master/index.js and https://github.com/fknsrs/yttej
22:04 < deoxxa1> erm
22:04 < deoxxa1> https://github.com/fknsrs/jetty
22:04 < deoxxa1> wow, i suck at typing this morning
22:05 < deoxxa1> ...and apparently at describing what i suck at, since i didn't even type that. i pasted it.
22:05 < deoxxa1> i need coffee!
22:05 < CoverSlide> deoxxa1: Error: Cannot find module 'Yttej' << typo
22:05 < deoxxa1> oh did i put yttej on npm yet..?
22:05 < deoxxa1> yeah, do an npm install
22:05 < CoverSlide> it seems like it
22:06 < torvalamo> have you looked under the couch?
22:06 < deoxxa1> oh
22:06 < deoxxa1> i see
22:06 < CoverSlide> lib/translator.js:4:var Yttej = require("Yttej");
22:06 < deoxxa1> fixed, CoverSlide. thanks :)
22:06 < CoverSlide> with npm it's lowercase-only
22:06 < deoxxa1> yeah
22:06 < deoxxa1> silly case-insensitive mac filesystem
22:07 < deoxxa1> i should have caught that
22:07 < CoverSlide> haha
22:07 < CoverSlide> pretty cool stuff
22:07 < deoxxa1> try resizing the terminal
22:07 < deoxxa1> it recalculates where the widgets should be
22:07 < CoverSlide> awesome
22:08 < cxreg> http://badassjs.com/post/39573969361/llvm-js-llvm-itself-compiled-to-javascript-via
22:08 < CoverSlide> whoa crazy
22:08 < deoxxa1> needs more clang compiled to js
22:08 < CoverSlide> well since i don't know llvm assembly we need clang now
22:08 < CoverSlide> oh beat me to it
22:08 < deoxxa1> :P
22:09 < Innocentus> hi
22:09 < Innocentus> so I want to serve static content
22:09 < deoxxa1> nginx is awesome for that
22:09 < Innocentus> however, most http servers - like the apache2 are serving it with some tweaks in order to prevent trouble with older browsers
22:09 < Innocentus> deoxxa1: so serving it with nodejs directly is not a good idea?
22:10 < CoverSlide> Innocentus: it's not a horrible idea
22:10 < CoverSlide> but nginx was made for that kind of thing
22:10 < deoxxa1> Innocentus: well it's not a *bad* idea, but it's overkill if you're never going to add any other features to it
22:11 < CoverSlide> it's all streams though so the impact on your app is minimal. if you have a lot of static content, then usually either using nginx or something manage them, or using vagrant or a cdn would probably be the best options
22:12 < CoverSlide> s/vagrant/varnish
22:12 < CoverSlide> i get those mixed up sometimes
22:14 < alex____> unitl node will be use V8 - it's never been as part of nginx (say Igor Sysoev about integration V8 in nginx core)
22:14 < alex____> lua more pretty for integration
22:14 < deoxxa1> yeah, v8 in nginx would be a huge mistake
22:15 < livinded> don't see the reason to mix the two
22:16 < Innocentus> yes
22:16 < CoverSlide> lua almost makes sense in nginx
22:16 < CoverSlide> like it was in redis
22:17 < CoverSlide> kind of like how apache used to bundle with PHP, made a great fit
22:18 < Innocentus> what is lua?
22:18 < Innocentus> a webserver?
22:19 < alex____> Lua - is language
22:19 < Innocentus> and I saw that node-varnish uses telnet for node-varnish communication, isn't that a bottleneck?
22:19 < Innocentus> yes, so nodelua?
22:19 < alex____> like a JS - but more syntax sugar and embedded
22:20 < Innocentus> but what has it to do with js?
22:20 < Innocentus> I mean, both are different languages
22:21 < CoverSlide> nothing
22:22 < CoverSlide> but that's one thing about nginx is that it has no scripting component, you usually proxy to your webapp that does all the logic
22:22 < manuelbieh> howdy friends
22:22 < CoverSlide> if nginx comes bundled with a scripting language it can be a game-changer
22:22 < manuelbieh> i'm just trying to i18n an application
22:22 < manuelbieh> using i18n node: https://github.com/mashpie/i18n-node
22:23 < manuelbieh> the readme says:
22:23 < manuelbieh> / register helpers for use in templates
22:23 < Innocentus> are there nice components for nodejs for navigation?
22:23 < manuelbieh> app.locals(......)
22:23 < Innocentus> I mean, where I can build a navigation tree and render breadcrumbs, menus and such stuff?
22:24 < manuelbieh> how can i access functions set via app.locals in consolidate.handlebars?! any ideas?
22:25 < CoverSlide> Innocentus: that sounds like something that should be built by hand
22:26 < emilsedgh> in released my first ever node module: https://github.com/emilsedgh/pdu.js
22:27 < emilsedgh> now i expect fame and glory!
22:27 < CoverSlide> emilsedgh: it takes a hex string?
22:27 < emilsedgh> no, a PDU string
22:27 < emilsedgh> which may contain different encodings (7bit or 16bit)
22:28 < CoverSlide> what is this useful for?
22:28 < emilsedgh> pdu is the plain way your cell phone talks to smsc
22:28 < CoverSlide> and why wouldn't the PDU data be a Buffer?
22:28 < emilsedgh> its supposed to work in browser as well
22:29 < CoverSlide> ok so how would someone use this? browser or otherwise?
22:29 < emilsedgh> as for usage, i have another module named modem.js. modem.js talks to AT modems and offers a higher level api for sending/receiving sms messages or executing ussd sessions
22:30 < emilsedgh> modem.js depends on this, but this could be used elsewhere. whoever wants to talk to smsc directly needs to generate/parse PDU's.
22:31 < emilsedgh> i cannot think of a valid browser use case except for demoing it (a tool that shows how pdu's work)
22:33 < __yh> so after all this time, i still don't know a better way to do array[array.length - 1] ?
22:33 < __yh> cause array[-1] doesn't work like in other languages
22:33 < kamoricks> Why would you need a better way?
22:34 < __yh> because thats like 2 calls, one to array.length then actually fetching the element
22:34 <@isaacs> trevnorris: hm... no, id ont' think i do..
22:35 < tjfontaine> __yh: trust the jit to do the right thing for you
22:35 < kamoricks> __yh: There's no way that would be more performant than that.
22:35 < __yh> seems bad if you had that in a loop, where the length of the array changed
22:35 < __yh> but you do want the last ele, without splicing/removing it
22:35 < __yh> constant aray.length calls
22:36 < CoverSlide> what do you think the other languages do when you put [-1]
22:36 < __yh> magic
22:37 < CoverSlide> at some point the vm will have to check the length of the array
22:37 < CoverSlide> yes, there's a thing about magic
22:37 < CoverSlide> real programmers don't like it
22:37 < tjfontaine> __yh: the jit/vm will do the magic for you, if it can
22:38 < styol> If there is a function that does some timestamp work, crypto.createHmac type stuff, and nothing appears to be asynchronous or has a callback, is it still worth converting this function into something that utilizes a callback or does it not make a difference? If that makes sense. Can provide a literal example if that might help.
22:39 <@mbalho> async is for io
22:40 < styol> mbalho: so it wouldn't make sense to utilize a callback unless something in this method performs io operations such as a database query, filesystem, etc?
22:41 < tjfontaine> well, an argument might be made if it already has to cross the c++ boundary and takes a while to compute
22:41 < tjfontaine> where a "while" is a relative term
22:41 < trevnorris> isaacs: cool. just wanted to update mine using your formatting, since the ones online are about a year old.
22:42 <@isaacs> yeah, it's in need of an update for sure
22:43 < taterbase> I'm trying to test a middleware that is never seen by the the requester, it happens internally
22:43 < taterbase> How can I test that that with mocha?
22:43 < taterbase> Like something that modifes the req.url
22:43 < superjoe> using jsdom is it possible to render the dom back out into html?
22:43 < manuelbieh> anybody here who can tell me how I can call template functions within handlebars templates?
22:45 <@isaacs> trevnorris: i always sort of intended to include the current v8 docs in the node docs, but never got around to it
22:45 <@isaacs> trevnorris: so if you're looking for a patch to write, that could be a good one :)
22:48 <@Nexxy> \o/
22:50 < CoverSlide> \o/
22:51 < trevnorris> isaacs: cool. so like include the Doxyfile in tools/, have it generate to docs/v8-docs/ or some such?
22:52 < taterbase> npm search redis
22:52 < trevnorris> and I can include "v8docs" to the Makefile.
22:56 <@isaacs> trevnorris: yep
22:56 <@isaacs> trevnorris: the default `make doc` target should build it
22:58 < CoverSlide> mmm id prefer it didn't
22:59 < trevnorris> isaacs: cool. ok, should I just check if doxygen is installed, or figure out how to include it?
23:05 < darrenlooby> Hi guys, I'm trying to find an update gist for using Express over HTTPS.  I keep getting the createServer depreciation when ever I use the stuff I've found so far. Any tips?
23:06 < tjholowaychuk> darrenlooby http://expressjs.com/api.html#app.listen
23:11 <@isaacs> trevnorris: hm.  i don't know.  maybe include it in tools/?
23:11 <@isaacs> trevnorris: or just fail fast if it's not installed
23:11 < darrenlooby> tjholowaychuk, ahhh... proper API docs... rather than the home page. Well done, don't I feel like a dick! lol
23:11 <@isaacs> either way is fine, i guess
23:11 <@isaacs> tjholowaychuk: i heard that Express doesn't work on node 0.9
23:12 <@isaacs> tjholowaychuk: do you have any insight into where i could start looking to fix that?
23:12 < CoverSlide> how big is deoxygen? maybe check what dependencies it has
23:12 < tjholowaychuk> oh really? no clue I haven't even bothered trying yet
23:12 < tjholowaychuk> I'll make a note to test that out soonish
23:12 < CoverSlide> doxygen is binary
23:13 < CoverSlide> would need to be platform-independant
23:13 <@isaacs> tjholowaychuk: ok, no worries.  i'll try it out now
23:13 < trevnorris> CoverSlide: I believe the source has everything needed. I'll check it out.
23:13 <@isaacs> tjholowaychuk: we're down to polishing the edge cases and fixing the last few %ge points of streams2 perf regressions
23:14 <@isaacs> tjholowaychuk: so 0.10 will probably be out in a few weeks.
23:14 < trevnorris> isaacs: I'll fail fast for now, and figure out how to build it later.
23:14 < tjholowaychuk> isaacs sounds good, I'll go through and get streams2 stuff ready in branches for 0.10
23:15 <@isaacs> tjholowaychuk: hm.  the default starter app works fine.  but obv that doesn't really exercise much of what express does.
23:16 < CoverSlide> see if it passes the mocha tests
23:16 < CoverSlide> unless mocha doesn't work ...
23:16 < CoverSlide> :p
23:16 < tjholowaychuk> I haven't had any reports but I'll install a newer node and take a look
23:16 <@isaacs> CoverSlide: fails with Error: .get() requires callback functions but got a [object String] right away
23:16 <@isaacs> /Users/isaacs/dev/js/expresstest/node_modules/express/lib/router/index.js:252
23:18 < tjholowaychuk> i get one socket hangup error
23:19 < tjholowaychuk> connect has 9 errors haha
23:19 < tjholowaychuk> woot
23:21 < darrenlooby> Hi guys, giving updated HTTPS server a go, with Express, coming across some crypto type errors (from what I can work out). Can anyone point me in the correct direction? Here's the Gist https://gist.github.com/4514785
23:23 < stagas> isaacs: npm is changing my .gitignores to .npmignores
23:24 < torvalamo> how dare it!
23:24 < stagas> :P
23:29 < CoverSlide> darrenlooby: you need the contents of the files, not the filenames themselves
23:30 < CoverSlide> usually you'd fs.readFileSync on those. the sync is ok since it's one time before the server begins
23:30 < darrenlooby> Ahh, okay - cool, easy enough. Well spotted! :D
23:35 < qxtirc> hi guys
23:35 < qxtirc> he guys
23:36 < CoverSlide> hello sexist pig
23:36 < qxtirc> what?
23:36 < CoverSlide> kidding
23:36 < skope> sexist pigs are the best
23:36 < acidjazz> jade -P < tpl/index.jade
23:36 < skope> consider me as one
23:36 < acidjazz> Error: the "filename" option is required to use includes
23:36 < qxtirc> what's new with node.js?
23:38 < CoverSlide> acidjazz: what happens if you do jade -P tpl/index.jade?
23:38 < CoverSlide> if you're using pipes it won't know the directory of the template you're starting from
23:39 <@isaacs> stagas: yes, in the package.  it does that.
23:39 <@isaacs> stagas: that's so that `git add node_modules` works properly
23:39 <@isaacs> stagas: by design
23:40 < acidjazz> CoverSlide: it fixes it!
23:40 < acidjazz> CoverSlide: thanks :)
23:41 < acidjazz> CoverSlide: yea i just saw in the code the filename module wont load w/out -P
23:42 < stagas> isaacs: can I have it completely forget rules for a dir and just dummy pack everything as it is?
23:44 < acidjazz> huh Error: EISDIR, illegal operation on a directory
23:45 < acidjazz> CoverSlide: thats my new error
23:47 < acidjazz> https://gist.github.com/4514966
23:47 < livinded> luckily I'm working on cool shit at this company, I just hate ad tech
23:47 < livinded> errr
23:47 < livinded> wrong window
23:47 <@Nexxy> lol
23:52 < acidjazz> so -p needs to be.. the path w/ the filename?
23:52 < acidjazz> the f
23:54 <@isaacs> stagas: um.. no.
23:54 <@isaacs> stagas: but you can stash it as a foo.gitignore and then rename it later if you like.
