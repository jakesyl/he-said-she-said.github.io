00:00 < lamalex> isaacbw: are you aware of what my problem is??
00:01 <@isaacbw> apparently not
00:04 < lamalex> ;)
00:05 < lamalex> im pulling data from a video blog via rss. ive got a bunch of youtube <iframe> embeds for videos and i want to display them
00:07 < lamalex> currently jade just posts the text of the tag rather than rendering the iframe
00:07 < ljharb> text of the tag?
00:08 < ljharb> you're doing <iframe src="youtube"></iframe>, right?
00:09 < lamalex> that's what the rss feed gives me, yah
00:09 <@isaacbw> *take
00:09 < lamalex> the problem is something with angularjs and jade
00:10 <@MI6> joyent/node: Ben Kelly master * 8a407f5 : os: Include netmask in os.networkInterfaces() - http://git.io/rx5RAQ
00:10 <@isaacbw> no, the problem is with how you're using them
00:10 < lamalex> ok
00:11 < lamalex> definitely will be the first one to admit it's likely something i'm doing wrong, or not doing
00:12 < lamalex> isaacbw: do you have any suggestions for what i might be doing wrong?
00:14 <@isaacbw> I've given you a few pointers so far
00:14 <@isaacbw> do a google search for 'jade escaping html'
00:15 < NotMyself> lamalex: p!= aVarContainingMoreHTML to dump unescaped raw html
00:16 < NotMyself> basically "!="
00:18 < ningu> I've been trying to escape html for 10 years
00:18 < ningu> haven't succeeded yet
00:19 < NotMyself> lamalex: here is an example where I am using it https://github.com/olynode/website/blob/master/views/shared/meeting.jade
00:19 < ljharb> nor will you
00:19 < ningu> ljharb: it may go away some day :P
00:19 < ljharb> please, hold your breath
00:19 < ningu> hehe
00:20 < s_e> maybe one of these json fanatics will subset a rendering spec for the web 
00:21 < lamalex> NotMyself: have you ever tried using it with angularjs?
00:21 <@MI6> joyent/libuv: Miroslav Bajtoš v0.10 * fe2a315 : test: add error logging to tty unit test (+1 more commits) - http://git.io/nc0Ujw
00:21 < NotMyself> yes replace angle brakets with curly GENIOUS!
00:21 < s_e> :D
00:21 < ningu> s_e: I would call renderable json argonaut
00:21 < s_e> haha
00:21 < NotMyself> lamalex: sorry nope
00:21 < ningu> sounds like a pretty terrible idea though
00:22 < ningu> I suppose less could go wrong than with html... but it might be more brittle to malformedness
00:22 < NotMyself> isnt there a DSL out there that attempts to do something like that.. bascailly write html with javascript syntax?
00:22 <@isaacbw> oh yea
00:23 < joaomamede> Hi, anyone has ever used knox to put some files on S3?
00:24 -!- mode/#Node.js [+o piscisaureus_] by ChanServ
00:24 < lamalex> NotMyself: this look reasonable? https://gist.github.com/lamalex/5544693
00:24 < garthk> Awesome. New benchmark, closer to the real situation, and avoiding setImmediate helps a GREAT deal.
00:25 < dypsilon> why, why use instanceof?!
00:26 <@isaacbw> dypsilon: what?
00:26 < dypsilon> sry wrong window
00:26 <@isaacbw> lol
00:27 < NotMyself> lamalex: seems reasonable but you might have to do something like this https://gist.github.com/NotMyself/5544700
00:27 < NotMyself> lamalex: also it might be easier to just create a helper
00:28 < ljharb> lamalex: personally i use EJS. it looks like html, and i can embed JS in it.
00:28 < lamalex> ljharb: have you used it with angularjs?
00:29 < ssafejava> +1 to EJS, simple, easy, does what you expect 
00:29 <@isaacbw> lamalex: I already said that mixing server-side and client-side rendering is insane
00:29 < NotMyself> i have to agree I kinda hate jade
00:29 < Alperen> can someone explain me why i cant access to manga object at 8th line. http://paste.elhan.org/yakoxunifi.avrasm
00:29 < ssafejava> NotMyself: Yes, Jade really gets on my nerves now & then... esp. commas in attribute definitions
00:30 < lamalex> time to check out EJS i suppose
00:30 < ssafejava> lamalex: it's essentially equivalent to _.template() templating
00:30 < ljharb> Alperen: you should be able to.
00:31 < Alperen> ljharb  i am getting ReferenceError: manga is not defined
00:31 < ssafejava> Alperen: Can you use a different paste site? that is 100% broken on my end
00:32 < thealphanerd> Nexxy: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/ccrma
00:32 < thealphanerd> live stream of Robert Henke talking about how he got into music / art
00:32 < thealphanerd> thought it might be up your alley
00:32 < ljharb> Alperen: well, you're missing a closing } between lines 14-15
00:33 < Alperen> ssafejava: http://pastie.org/7820489
00:34 < ljharb> oh, maybe the indentation just sucks
00:34 < Alperen> ljharb: i think there is no problem.
00:34 < ljharb> Alperen: wait. did you mean manga dot chapters, or manga comma chapters
00:34 < Alperen> ljharb: dot
00:35 < ljharb> there's a comma in the pastie
00:35 < Alperen> ljharb: i saw i fixed it but that is not the problem too :)
00:35 < dypsilon> 1,5 hours lost because of instanceof in "forever" ...
00:38 < dypsilon> http://media.tumblr.com/82277d5ce50a3ab62a6af1b145935068/tumblr_inline_mg9iiqPNAj1raprkq.gif
00:38 < ssafejava> Alperen: What's the error that you're getting? I don't see why `manga` would go out of scope, But I would rewrite line 9 to `m.save(fn)` and remove line 11
00:41 < Alperen> ssafejava: interesting. if i add var currManga = manga; it can access currManga but it cannot access the manga
00:42 < ssafejava> Alperen: Are you relying on the debugger to tell you that?
00:42 < Alperen> ssafejava: yes
00:42 < ssafejava> Alperen: Don't trust it 100%. Sometimes you need to reference something inside an anonymous function for it to show up in scope in the debugger. I wish I knew why
00:43 < Alperen> ssafejava: so if i run it directly it should access the manga?
00:44 < myndzi> has anybody got something like a duplex stream stub?
00:45 < myndzi> a stream that would just pass data along but can then be modified to whatever
00:45 < myndzi> just so all the right bits are in place
00:45 < ssafejava> Alperen: Yeah should be fine. 
00:45 < Alperen> ssafejava: ok thanks
00:45 < ssafejava> Alperen: easy way to check - use console.log statements, if those don't work then you might be in trouble
00:46 < strbcks> Hi, is still a "bad idea" to use domain without cluster just to catch error messages so I can pass them to my logging system and then shut down the process?
00:46 < ssafejava> strbcks: Why would that be a bad idea?
00:46 < strbcks> (I'm currently using uncaughtException to pass the errors to winston)
00:46 < strbcks> ssafejava: well, the docs say so..
00:47 < strbcks> http://nodejs.org/api/domain.html#domain_warning_don_t_ignore_errors
00:47 < ssafejava> yes. but what it's really saying is, you need to shut down the process, not do a catch-continue
00:47 < strbcks> I don't understand why though
00:47 < strbcks> oh I see :)
00:47 < ssafejava> so as long as you're restarting the process, I think you're fine. 
00:48 < strbcks> great, thanks ssafejava!
00:48 < ssafejava> cluster is a really nice way to do that b/c you can kill a worker without really interrupting service. but there are other ways to recover
00:49 < lamalex> hey NotMyself, i switched my views over to ejs but it's not combining my layout.ejs with my index.ejs- any idea?
00:49 < strbcks> why but this service is really basic, I really don't think it will ever have an error, just 90 lines of code
00:49 < ssafejava> strbcks: Then you probably shouldn't bother with domains at all if it's not something that needs 100% uptime
00:49 < NotMyself> use the docs lamalex 
00:49 < ssafejava> or to be 100% consistent
00:51 < strbcks> ssafejava: probably you are right, but maybe some upgrade will broke something someday...
00:51 < ssafejava> strbcks: It is true that process.on('uncaughtException') may be killed some day, but it will ruffle some feathers when it is
00:52 < strbcks> true :)
00:52 < ericelliott> ssafejava: I don't see a good reason to kill it any time soon. Let domains bake in for a couple years, first.
00:55 < strbcks> night o/
01:17 <@MI6> joyent/node: Robert Kowalski v0.10 * dc92ff8 : doc: document stream.Writable 'error' event - http://git.io/mYqrHw
01:49 < r1card> Is there general recognition among the Node.JS community, that the design of callbacks is coming from a shortage in the JS language regarding handling non-blocking tasks?
01:49 < garthk> Are all EventEmitter event callbacks called on a subsequent tick to the e.emit() call? None? Some?
01:50 < garthk> r1card: uh, pretty much *all* Algol style languages lack a "shortage… regarding handling non-blocking tasks". 
01:50 < garthk> s/lack a/have a/
01:50 < dypsilon_> r1card, only among meteor devs
01:50 < r1card> garthk, still, it's possible to add.
01:51 < r1card> It's basically what Windows apps did in the 80s with cooperative multitasking.
01:51 < r1card> Node.JS is in essense cooperative multitasking design
01:51 < havvy> Cooperative multitasking for a single program is nice.
01:51 < garthk> r1card: we've been adding for decades. We do it with frameworks, whether threading libraries or event loops or task managers or job queues or whatever. They tend to come from the environment in which the language is run, though, not the language itself.
01:52 < havvy> Java has threads, and it sucks...
01:52 < garthk> Hell, even Erlang — built to do this kind of thing from the ground up — leaves most of the coroutine business up to the library and environment rather than the language.
01:52 < r1card> garthk, and that works, but it requires callbacks. Lots of them. No exceptions.
01:53 < r1card> garthk, it's not the best way.
01:54 < r1card> havvy, nah, no threads. We're talking one thread here.
01:54 < garthk> Looping back: if you asked the question in the form "are callbacks the way Node deals with the results of non-blocking tasks", I think the answer is pretty much yes. You didn't ask that way, though, and your "is there general recognition… shortage…" approach comes across as hostile and dismissive. 
01:54 < garthk> "not the best way" also comes across as trolling.
01:54 < r1card> garthk, no it's not "hostile and dismissive" don't worry I won't attack you with an IRC knife.
01:55 < r1card> I just was wondering, do people realize that the design of callbacks is not the only way to do this.
01:55 < r1card> Because if they do, that could open the door for an awesome Node.JS version Next.
01:56 < r1card> garthk, from you attitude, I guess any suggestion JS might benefit from upgrades is verbotten.
01:56 < garthk> "do people realize… not the only way" hahahaha oh dear. Mate, with that tone, you're not going to get any "recognition" anytime. Hopefully your programming chops exceed your people skills. In which case: build your own thing, and you can prove all us "shortage… not the best… [not realizing]" people wrong. Good luck!
01:57 < r1card> garthk, I never said anyone is wrong dude. You're maybe having a poor day.
01:57 < r1card> My question was specific.
01:58 < garthk> On a more practical note: Node.js is pragmatic. It deals with the language it has. If your better way needs language changes, that's going to need a new thing that isn't Node.js. Again: good luck!
01:58 < r1card> Thanks, for wishing me good luck, but you never answered my question.
01:58 < r1card> I guess too busy treating everything as an attack.
01:58 < r1card> Anyway, forget it.
01:58 < r1card> Anyone else?
01:59 < havvy> r1card: ES-Discuss for the future of JS. ;)
01:59 < havvy> Node.js uses V8, for better or for worse.
02:00 < r1card> havvy, I think discussing directly as ECMA won't strongly enough demonstrate the benefits, compared to a strong community like Node.JS coming and saying "this would make our lives better"
02:00 < r1card> ECMA is a committee, they're swayed by large number of people.
02:01 < r1card> I don't know if anyone has seen the Tasks.JS "hack" with generators (yield) but it points to a possible future improvement of JS to deal with async tasks.
02:01 < mashlol> Anyone know a good module that has an ajax request method for node that's similar to jQueries? ( using the node jquery is not an option :( )
02:01 < px> request
02:01 < havvy> The ES-Discuss people have seen Task.JS I'm sure.
02:02 < mashlol> thanks px
02:07 < r1card> havvy, where is that channel?
02:07 < r1card> forum/site/whatever
02:09 < havvy> Google it. (I don't have it memorized.)  It's a mailing list.
02:10 < r1card> ok, thanks.
02:22 < _xa1nthi> anyone familiar / experienced with watchr by any chance?
02:23 < _xa1nthi> having this strange problem where events fired under a dir via ssh work fine.. but those done on same dir via php script trigger nothing
02:24 < _algo_> what is a "global" object in node.js?
02:24 < _xa1nthi> anything outside of closure algo
02:25 < _algo_> there is something strange with it
02:25 < _algo_> console.log( global.parseInt ) outputs a function
02:25 < _algo_> console.log( global ) doesn't output it
02:25 < _algo_> is it non-enumerable? why?
02:25 < _algo_> or something else?
02:25 < _xa1nthi> because parseInt is a global function
02:25 < _algo_> _xa1nthi: ... but not in global object?
02:25 < _xa1nthi> and global alone isn't specific to anything 
02:26 < _algo_> from the other hand, global object has Buffer
02:26 < _xa1nthi> so it chokes
02:26 < _algo_> ... but not String!
02:26 < _algo_> what's going on with it?
02:26 < _algo_> it contains only stuff not from V8 ?
02:26 < _xa1nthi> going too deep on me now.. but I think its because the global object is dynamic not a stratic bit of text like we tend to imagine it 
02:27 < _algo_> ?
02:27 < _algo_> well, hope to hear from someone who knows =)
02:27 < _xa1nthi> I wish someone would theorize about my issue :)
02:29 < _algo_> the docs say nothing about global object
02:30 < _algo_> instead, they do the most to confuse people

02:32 < _algo_> it looks like isaacs knows
02:33 < _algo_> but hard to ask him here :/
02:36 < RobW_> Any suggestions on moving and renaming the contents of a directory? 
02:37 < RobW_> For instance I have a directory of unknown number/named files and I want to rename to _{original name}.{new extension}
02:37 < havvy> Do you care about Windows support?
02:37 < RobW_> havvy: Hmmm noooot really.
02:38 < havvy> Then call 'mv'.
02:38 < RobW_> Just use an exec child process?
02:38 < havvy> Yeah.
02:38 < RobW_> Cool. Wasn't sure if there was node magic for me. Thanks.
02:39 < havvy> If there is, it's in fs
02:40 < dypsilon_> RobW_, also there is shelljs: https://github.com/arturadib/shelljs
02:41 < havvy> fs.rename
02:41 < RobW_> dypsilon_: Ugh, that almost seems like cheating.
02:41 < RobW_> Very cool.
02:43 < RobW_> I could do it with rename if I can get the names of all files in a dir in an array.
02:43 < dypsilon_> https://npmjs.org/package/walkdir
02:44 < havvy> RobW_: Are you renaming files as part of your script?
02:44 < havvy> Or is your script *to* rename stuff?
02:45 < RobW_> havvy: as part of a Yo generator I want to grab all files in a dir and rename based on the orig file names. So number 1.
02:46 < ChrisPartridge> ugh, IE10 already causing trouble
02:46 < havvy> Also, mmv (the unix util) might be helpful.
02:46 < havvy> ChrisPartridge: How so?
02:46 < havvy> And why are there so many Chrises in here?
02:46 < ChrisPartridge> havvy: CORS requests, https://connect.microsoft.com/IE/feedback/details/785990/ie-10-on-win8-does-not-assign-the-correct-status-to-xmlhttprequest-when-the-result-is-401
02:47 < dypsilon_> RobW_, looks like a job for grunt
02:47 < dypsilon_> grunt has some utilities for files
02:47 < RobW_> dypsilon_: shells seems perfect for a short scaffolding app. Any downsides to using it?
02:47 < dypsilon_> RobW_, don't know, you will become lazy and spoiled?
02:48 < RobW_> dypsilon_: That's what I thought.
02:48 < dypsilon_> there are enough packages depending on shelljs, i would give it a try
02:48 < dypsilon_> it's not like you can't throw it away if you don't like
02:54 < garbagegod> does anyone else share my initial feelings about node having taken the time to understand it that it's the fucking singularity
02:59 < jarrod__> anyone here have experience installing packages using npm on windows8?
03:00 < jarrod__> im having issues trying to install packages locally, as of now it appears i can only install packages globally? for instance, "npm install socket.io -g"
03:01 < sysx1000> garbagegod: huh?
03:01 < ChrisPartridge> jarrod__: what happens when you install locally?
03:03 < jarrod__> and series of errors: http://pastebin.com/mzShZGdk
03:03 < jarrod__> a series*
03:04 < ChrisPartridge> jarrod__: are you sure you don't have an error in D:\Projects\wanderfoot\web\server\package.json
03:05 < jarrod__> i thought the contents of that file did not matter, i assumed "npm install {package_name}" just pulls down the package into the local directory in 'node_modules/{package_name}'
03:05 < jarrod__> what should that file contain?
03:05 < ChrisPartridge> jarrod__: https://npmjs.org/doc/json.html
03:06 < jarrod__> ugh... wall of text =/
03:06 < ChrisPartridge> it parses it, because if you do "npm install some_package", you might have a specific version defined in package.json - so instead of just getting the latest, it will get the version your application requires
03:07 < jarrod__> then wouldnt all i need to do is run "npm install"
03:07 < ChrisPartridge> yep
03:07 < ChrisPartridge> if package.json is valid
03:07 < ChrisPartridge> which it isn't, in your case, hence the error
03:08 < jarrod__> would you mind looking at my sample package.json file? http://pastebin.com/3jizaAVi
03:09 < LegCow> anyone using mongoose with their own api?
03:09 < jarrod__> it appears to fail on depedencies
03:11 < ChrisPartridge> jarrod__, no comma after the "express" definition
03:11 < ChrisPartridge> or socket.io
03:12 -!- mode/#Node.js [+o TooTallNate] by ChanServ
03:13 < ChrisPartridge> jarrod__: this will work https://gist.github.com/cjpartridgeb/5545314
03:14 < jarrod__> appeared to fix some problems, but now i have a few more: http://pastebin.com/4YERsVBJ
03:15 < jarrod__> something related to the password? is that something to do with my npm user?
03:17 < ChrisPartridge> jarrod__: try remove .npmrc from C:\Users\<your username>
03:18 < jarrod__> doing so now
03:19 < jarrod__> looks like everything downloaded
03:19 < ChrisPartridge> excellent
03:19 < jarrod__> just two warnings
03:19 < jarrod__> one was a readme not existing (no big deal) the other one im not sure
03:19 < ChrisPartridge> you can probably ignore them
03:19 < ChrisPartridge> whats the other say?
03:20 < jarrod__> npm WARN engine formidable@1.0.13: wanted: {"node":"<0.9.0"} (current: {"node":" v0.10.5","npm":"1.2.18"})
03:21 < ChrisPartridge> so, formidable package wants node version less than 0.9 - where as you are running 0.10
03:21 < ChrisPartridge> might work ;\
03:21 < jarrod__> ah
03:22 < jarrod__> one last question if you dont mind, is there anyway to delete the user i created (the one associated with npm adduser)?
03:22 < jarrod__> ive google searched but it lead me only to a place where i can reset the password
03:22 < jarrod__> i accidentally created the user before knowing what it was
03:26 < ChrisPartridge> jarrod__: not sure, perhaps ask isaacs when he's around
03:26 < jarrod__> alright, thanks for the help

03:27 < ChrisPartridge> PSA: Don't use status code 401 with CORS if you want to support IE10
04:03 < adrivanrex_> guys you have any idea how to get rid of this?
04:03 < adrivanrex_> http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=185877141569728&set=a.101656679991775.2967.100004423290358&type=1&theater
04:04 < ChrisPartridge> adrivanrex_: you were asking this yesterday, have you got an example of the code you are executing?
04:06 < adrivanrex_> I'm using expressJS
04:06 < adrivanrex_> sometimes the warning shows like that
04:06 < adrivanrex_> like 11 listeners added
04:06 < adrivanrex_> possible event emitter memory leak
04:07 < ChrisPartridge> yes, I can see the screenshot - but express doesn't do that out of the box. So it's something in your code...
04:08 < adrivanrex_> The error comes out when the user is loading slow
04:08 < px> maybe your own code leaks and the event emitter just hits it?
04:09 < adrivanrex_> as I have experience it it shows when the user is loading very very slow
04:09 < adrivanrex_> http://nodecms.bot.nu/
04:09 < adrivanrex_> there's nothing wrong with the code
04:09 < ChrisPartridge> ...
04:09 < adrivanrex_> It shows sometimes.. but not always
04:09  * ChrisPartridge goes to lunch
04:09 < adrivanrex_> so there might be a bug when a user is loading fast or slow
04:10 < adrivanrex_> http://nodecms.bot.nu/ <- it's working.. but sometimes the error just pop out
04:11 < adrivanrex_> do you think this is something to do with spamming the POST or GET?
04:12 < ningu> adrivanrex_: you'll have to pastebin your code
04:12 < ningu> there is definitely a bug with the code
04:12 < ningu> I don't blame ChrisPartridge for his reaction :)
04:14 < supernaut> in v0.10 streams how can you know when a readable event is going to occur?
04:14 < supernaut> i am trying stream writes to a file and then read those writes from the same file in near real time.
04:15 < supernaut> the write part works, but the reader doesn't do anything
04:30 < myndzi> what's this 'free' event in _http_agent.js
04:30 < myndzi> is that emitted on the socket when an http transaction completes?
04:35 < jdelgado> Thoughts on adding a unique request ID to each API call response?
04:36 < chilts> jdelgado: I created both connect-uuid and connect-flake for this purpose
04:36 < chilts> it'll add a unique ID to req, either req.uuid or req.flake
04:36 < chilts> try one of those :)
04:37 < jdelgado> chilts: I'll check them out! Thanks!
04:37 < chilts> https://npmjs.org/package/connect-flake or https://npmjs.org/package/connect-uuid
04:37 < chilts> :)
04:37 < chilts> have fun
04:37 < jdelgado> :)
04:37 < chilts> remember to use a proper interface if you're using the flake version
04:37 < chilts> are you Linux or Mac or something else?
04:37 < sinclair|node> chilts: what does it do?
04:37 < chilts> sinclair|node: what does what do?
04:38 < jdelgado> chilts: Linux all the way!
04:39 < chilts> jdelgado: cool, so try eth0 or wlan0 or something with connect-flake ... connect-uuid doesn't need any configuration :)
04:39 < sinclair|node> chilts: the uuid one is a nice one
04:39 < chilts> thanks :)
04:39 < chilts> yeah, I also log that crap to my log files so I can grep out all messages related to a single request!
04:39 < chilts> it's awesome foursome
04:39 < sinclair|node> chilts: want to take a look at my current project?
04:39 < chilts> link?
04:40 < sinclair|node> chilts: https://npmjs.org/package/typescript.api
04:40 < chilts> nice
04:40 < chilts> not for me though :)
04:40 < sinclair|node> chilts: its a fairly sizable one
04:40 < jdelgado> sinclair|node: Very nice
04:41 < sinclair|node> jdelgado: thanks
04:41 < sinclair|node> TS 0.9 with generics support, the only package on npm right now doing that
04:41 < jdelgado> Indeed
04:42 < jdelgado> chilts: Just looked at the UUID source - that must have been one hell of a module to code, huh? ;)
04:43 < chilts> I didn't write uuid :)
04:43 < chilts> that was broofa :)
04:44 < chilts> connect-uuid is 7 lines of code :D
04:44 < chilts> heh
04:44 < sinclair|node> jdelgado: do you do TS at all?
04:44 < chilts> ah, uuid-js was by someone else - Patrick Negri
04:45 < jdelgado> chilts: Yeah, I meant your side was pretty easy. :)
04:45 < jdelgado> sinclair|node: I personally don't
04:46 < sinclair|node> jdelgado: i was going to take a look at coffee script after this project, wrap it up in the same interface
04:46 < sinclair|node> i dont know how accessible the coffeescript ast is tho
04:47 < chilts> jdelgado: ah yeah :)
04:47 < chilts> the best modules are the small ones
04:48 < jdelgado> sinclair|node: Yeah, definately a good idea
04:48 < jdelgado> chilts: I'll drink to that
04:54 < ShodoPan> Hey OSX folks, when you npm install -g something, do you need sudo to do it?
04:55 < ningu> ShodoPan: depends on the permissions of the directory.
04:56 < ShodoPan> right, so what are the permissions of the directory? say for homebrew installs?
04:57 < ningu> I'm not sure what the defaults are. I have it set up to be owned by my user acct
04:57 < ShodoPan> IIRC MacPorts did need sudo because it was installing stuff to /usr/local or something
04:57 < ningu> well yes but you can change the perms of /usr/local
04:57 < ShodoPan> didn't know anyone did that o.O
04:58 < ningu> why not?
04:58 < ningu> the point of /usr/local is you can do what you want with it
04:58 < ShodoPan> because it's weird ;)
04:59 < ShodoPan> it's not actually all that weird, it sorta violates the UNIX way, but that way was devised for multi-tenant systems, not laptops
04:59 < ningu> right
04:59 < ningu> I wouldn't do it on a server
04:59 < ShodoPan> just didn't know that anyone bothered to change that
04:59 < ningu> I suppose you could always add yourself to the wheel group and make it writable by wheel
04:59 < ShodoPan> well thanks, I think I have my answer, which is "it depends"
05:00 < ningu> well, it's much easier than doing sudo every time and I figure it's safe enough to have a user who can write to /usr/local without sudo since it's just /usr/local
05:02 < ljharb> i find it much easier to never use brew or ports
05:02 < ljharb> just make install from the git repo :-)
05:02 < ljharb> or npm of course
05:15 < ningu> ljharb: doesn't really answer the permissions question though
05:15 < ljharb> true
05:20 < ningu> do you guys pronounce bin to rhyme with pin, and lib to rhyme with fib?
05:20 < ljharb> absolutely
05:20 < jarofghosts> uh huh
05:20 < ningu> as in /usr/bin and /usr/lib
05:21 < myndzi> bine, libe!
05:21 < ningu> ok, I think that's the norm among unix folks
05:21 < ningu> haha
05:21 < ljharb> and "char" like what you do to meat. not like the bear that shoots rainbows out of its chest.
05:21 < ningu> that would be the alternative, yes
05:21 < myndzi> care!
05:21 < ningu> what about /etc?
05:21 < myndzi> leenux!
05:21 < jarofghosts> eh its hard for me to do the charbroil thing
05:21 < myndzi> hehe
05:21 < ljharb> ningu: et-see
05:21 < ljharb> ie etsy :-p
05:21 < ningu> hehe
05:21 < myndzi> how would you pronounce s/foo/bar/
05:21 < myndzi> ;)
05:22 < ningu> I guess I would just not pronounce the slashes
05:22 < ljharb> s (hand gesture for slash) foo (hand gesture for slash) bar
05:22 < ningu> hehe
05:22 < myndzi> i did it once in conversation, felt like such a nerd
05:22 < ningu> that works too
05:22 < ljharb> the slashes are silent
05:22 < myndzi> but i just said essentially "sub foo bar"
05:22 < ningu> sub? that's confusing
05:22 < ljharb> that works too
05:22 < myndzi> substitute
05:22 < myndzi> which is what the s stands for
05:22 < ljharb> that's what "s" stands for
05:22 < ningu> I know, but sub has other meanings e.g. in perl
05:22 < ningu> which also has s///
05:22  * myndzi shrugs
05:23 < myndzi> context sensitive statements!
05:23 < jarofghosts> yeah
05:23 < jarofghosts> wheres the g or the i
05:23 < ljharb> so, that's perl
05:23 < ningu> I don't know how I'd pronounce tr/ab/cd/
05:23 < jarofghosts> here i am
05:23 < jarofghosts> thinking about perl
05:23 < ljharb> do most perl programmers talk to other people, out loud? :-p
05:23 < myndzi> "trabcd"
05:23 < jarofghosts> i thought that would never happen again
05:23 < ningu> ljharb: yeah, good thing we don't have to pronounce $_
05:23 < myndzi> makes me think of this sesame street song
05:24 < jarofghosts> @_
05:24 < myndzi> where they pronounced the alphabet
05:24 < jarofghosts> abkadeffee
05:24 < myndzi> $www = worst variable to read
05:24 < jarofghosts> or something
05:24 < myndzi> yeah
05:24 < ljharb> myndzi: dollar dub dub, what's wrong with that
05:24 < myndzi> ab-cuh-def-gee-hij-kll-muh-nop-qwer-stu-vwyx-iz
05:24 < ChrisPartridge> ljharb: i thought most of the remaining perl programmers were locked up away from the world..
05:25 < myndzi> "dollar sign double-u double-u double-u"
05:25 < myndzi> ;)
05:25 < myndzi> even dollar dub dub dub is annoying
05:25 < ningu> w3c is hard to say too
05:25 < ningu> kinda
05:25 < myndzi> yeah
05:25 < myndzi> every time i hear it i puke
05:25 < myndzi> oh wait
05:25 < myndzi> i mean w3cschools
05:25 < ningu> no, that's w3schools
05:25 < jarofghosts> barf
05:26 < ningu> is the dot in node.js silent?
05:26 < ningu> actually, does the dot even exist?
05:26 < ningu> or is it nodejs/NodeJS
05:26 < myndzi> these are important questions that need answers
05:26 < jarofghosts> hahaha
05:26 < myndzi> also what if somebody misinterprets it as "node, just sayin'"
05:27 < myndzi> we should do something about that
05:27 < ningu> SMH
05:27 < jarofghosts> "is it nodejs"? << in #node.js
05:27 < adrivanrex_> who owns htis?
05:27 < ningu> but it's nodejs.org ;)
05:27 < adrivanrex_> html2jade.com
05:27 < jarofghosts> yeah until we get a js tld
05:27 < myndzi> funny, every time i try to ask about something useful it's dead in here
05:27 < myndzi> :P
05:27 < jarofghosts> duhhhh
05:27 < jarofghosts> such is irc
05:27 < myndzi> indeed
05:28 < myndzi> but you'd think that statistically over time i'd get like, one useful result
05:28 < myndzi> at some point
05:28 < jarofghosts> im surprised to find any activity at all tbh
05:28 < myndzi> maybe i just stumble into the stuff nobody wants anything to do with
05:28 < myndzi> right now i'm writing my own agent!
05:28 < ningu> well, just cause it's not dead doesn't mean anyone here knows anythign useful
05:28 < jarofghosts> i was convinced irc was just a giant botnet
05:28 < ljharb> it's "node.js" but commonly referred to as "node"
05:28 < ningu> anything*
05:28 < ljharb> mainly due to copyright
05:28 < ningu> ljharb: yes, but how do you *pronounce* node.js?
05:28 < ljharb> node dot jay ess
05:28 < ljharb> or shorter, node jay ess
05:28 < ningu> I leave out the dot
05:28 < jarofghosts> node.Jay-Z
05:28 < ljharb> or shorter, node
05:28 < myndzi> i like to say "en oh dee ee period jay ess"
05:29 < adrivanrex_> never thought nodejs is an active communitye haha
05:29 < ningu> adrivanrex_: have you seen the number of modules on npm?
05:30 < ljharb> adrivanrex_: it's one of the most active communities, period.
05:30 < ningu> also, this irc channel is not the same as the community
05:30 < jarofghosts> who is going to nodepdx?
05:30 < adrivanrex_> IRC is old but still I find good programmers in IRC
05:30 < ningu> mailing lists, github, conferences, etc.
05:31 < myndzi> irc is venerable >:(
05:31 < ChrisPartridge> i usually look for good programmers on rent-a-coder
05:31 < myndzi> or venereal
05:31 < myndzi> i forget which
05:31 < adrivanrex_> indeed
05:31 < ningu> how about rent-a-noder(tm)
05:31 < myndzi> i usually look for good programmers in the mirro :V
05:31 < myndzi> mirror*
05:32 < ChrisPartridge> ningu: i'll get the domain, you build the app, fair deal?
05:32 < adrivanrex_> how bout sucking ur dick? haha
05:32 < myndzi> haven't been that flexible since i was 16!
05:32 < myndzi> er what?
05:32 < jarofghosts> you build the app and ill give you equity
05:32 < adrivanrex_> joke
05:33 < ningu> nah, I like my current gig, gonna try to make it into a terabyte
05:35 < adrivanrex_> anyone wanna host this?
05:35 < adrivanrex_> https://github.com/ekinertac/html2jade/
05:36 < jarofghosts> i dont get it
05:36 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: Like a webapp?
05:36 < adrivanrex_> yah, the main site is not working
05:36 < adrivanrex_> hate it
05:37 < adrivanrex_> http://html2jade.com/
05:37 < adrivanrex_> I'm working on something and now it's not working
05:37 < AAA_awright> Awww
05:37 < adrivanrex_> http://html2jade.com/
05:37 < jarofghosts> whats it do
05:38 < adrivanrex_> convert HTML to jade
05:38 < jarofghosts> hmm
05:38 < adrivanrex_> I'm doing it for the themes of my NOdecms
05:38 < adrivanrex_> so i can easily replace themes eheh
05:38 < adrivanrex_> nodecms.bot.nu
05:39 < adrivanrex_> http://nodecms.bot.nu
05:39 < adrivanrex_> @AAA_awright can you host it?
05:40 < AAA_awright> I'm thinking about it
05:40 < adrivanrex_> alright.. I'll wait
05:40 < adrivanrex_> you have facebook? I'll add you
05:41 < adrivanrex_> @AAA_awright
05:41 < adrivanrex_> want to be friends with you hehehe
05:43 < AAA_awright> I'm wondering if I should do a Node.js server, or a PHP page just for the lulz
05:43 < AAA_awright> PHP probably because I wouldn't have to maintain a Node.js process
05:43 < AAA_awright> At least until I can integrate it into Magnode
05:43 < adrivanrex_> I dont konw that.. hehe sorry just a beginnner
05:44 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: Don't know what?
05:44 < geNAZt> AAA_awright: also a PHP App is easier to extend :D
05:44 < adrivanrex_> ahw sorry, I think I'm not included in the convo.. hehe
05:45 < adrivanrex_> some conversations I missed
05:47 < adrivanrex_> @AAA_awright did you manage to host it?
05:47 < adrivanrex_>  https://github.com/ekinertac/html2jade/
05:47 < AAA_awright> I think I'm doing it in PHP
05:47 < AAA_awright> Gimme me 15 minutes
05:47 < ChrisPartridge> lol wtf
05:48 < adrivanrex_> Cool
05:48 < adrivanrex_> I'll be waiting dude.. can I add you on facebook? we might have something to do in the near future
05:50 < adrivanrex_> I am thinking it will cost you a lost of time for the converter
05:50 < ningu> KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — A federal jury has found an 83-year-old nun and two fellow protesters guilty of breaking into the Y-12 National Security Complex and defacing a uranium processing plant.
05:51 < adrivanrex_> what's that? defacing hahaha that's very kiddie
05:55 < adrivanrex_> Arghhh can't continue on this project due to this FF
05:55 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: I'm here 24/7, like
05:56 < adrivanrex_> can I add you on FB or something a personal page.. Don't like IRC it's like talking to a plant
05:56 < AAA_awright> Oh dear I thought that was a library, not an application
05:56 < AAA_awright> Hm
05:57 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: Did you bother googling "html to jade converter"? There seems to be such stuff as http://html2jade.aaron-powell.com/
05:57 < adrivanrex_> Yeah, I check the code it's like thosuands of codes
05:57 < adrivanrex_> It's not working
05:57 < adrivanrex_> the link you posted
05:58 < adrivanrex_> the only working converter is the html2jade.com
05:58 < adrivanrex_> which is down right now
05:58 < ChrisPartridge> the one AAA_awright posted works fine for me
05:58 < AAA_awright> Yeah me too
05:58 < ChrisPartridge> And why do you need it hosted?
05:58 < AAA_awright> You can't clone it and host it yourself?
05:58 < adrivanrex_> I dont know but it's not working here.. It's outdated I guess
05:59 < adrivanrex_> my OS is windows 7
05:59 < adrivanrex_> errors occur
05:59 < ChrisPartridge> or just use the html2jade package in your CMS
05:59 < AAA_awright> Errors occur?
06:00 < prishabh> ok guys breaking news, meteorjs has blown my mind...
06:00 < myndzi> if you close a socket with .end or .destroy, does it emit a 'close' event?
06:00 < ningu> myndzi: it should for end, not sure about destroy. but try it...
06:01 < myndzi> there's an emit close inside _destroy
06:01 < myndzi> just looking for confirmation ;)
06:01 < ningu> :)
06:01 < adrivanrex_> I dont know when I reconvert my html it's not working
06:02 < adrivanrex_> it only works on html2jade
06:07 < adrivanrex_> hey awright  what you don ?
06:07 < adrivanrex_> doin?
06:09 < adrivanrex_> thanks for the time I got it working now
06:21 < AAA_awright> This stupid library requires THIRTY EIGHT dependencies
06:21 < myndzi> awwright!
06:21 < AAA_awright> I SERIOUSLY DOUBT parsing HTML and spitting out Jade requires 38 dependencies
06:21 < AAA_awright> oauth-sign.. why
06:21 < myndzi> this is why i don't like libraries
06:21 < myndzi> ROLL YOUR OWN!
06:21 < ChrisPartridge> lol oauth-sign... serious?
06:21 < myndzi> (unfortunately i do wind up rolling my own more often than not :P)
06:21 < AAA_awright> node-uuid keypress assert-plus aws-sign
06:22 < myndzi> sounds like dev dependencies
06:22 < AAA_awright> forever-agent
06:22 < AAA_awright> WHYT
06:22 < ChrisPartridge> AAA_awright: these are top level dependecies?
06:22 < AAA_awright> ChrisPartridge: I move them top-level
06:24 < AAA_awright> myndzi: Normally I'd say NIH syndrome
06:24 < Uma> Hi...I am new to node..can anyone tell me if it is possible to get data in parts in exec command instead of waiting until the entire data is returned in the callback...
06:24 < AAA_awright> myndzi: But really, Node.js libraries tend to suck hard, and I don't blame you. PHP has far more to be proud of in this area >_>
06:25 < AAA_awright> And right now my library isn't detecting stdin closing, fantastic
06:25 < ningu> what about forever-alone
06:26 < ningu> Uma: use spawn instead of exec
06:27 < Uma> ok thanks...
06:29 < AAA_awright> That's it
06:29 < AAA_awright> I give up
06:29 < AAA_awright> I'm emerging nodejs
06:29 < geNAZt> what leads you to this ?
06:30 < AAA_awright> Since the beginning I've been compiling this but... Node.js just has an ever-increasing tangle of a build system
06:30 < AAA_awright> I swear it's worse than Blender
06:31 < AAA_awright> But mostly I'm just being silly, Gentoo has been automating this process for a while now, appearently
06:32 < AAA_awright> Argh, what happened to --shared-v8
06:32 < geNAZt> well but what is bad about nodejs in your view ?
06:33 < AAA_awright> geNAZt: What do you mean, in general?
06:33 < geNAZt> yes
06:34 < adrivanrex_> indeed nodejs Is good
06:34 < AAA_awright> The build system, the Git repository, not much is fundementally wrong, why do you ask?
06:34 < adrivanrex_> hahah awright It's funny the jade converter hahaha
06:34 < geNAZt> well i want to know peoples oppinion about nodejs.
06:34 < adrivanrex_> My opion is it's quite good
06:34 < geNAZt> and much people say "nodejs is the goddes on earth"
06:35 < adrivanrex_> with regards to websockets
06:35 < geNAZt> and i dont want to believe that
06:35 < geNAZt> each system has downsides
06:35 < AAA_awright> It's an idea that had to happen sooner or later
06:35 < adrivanrex_> hahaha do you know anything abbout sockets
06:35 < AAA_awright> I tried something similar with Spidermonkey... Which is just a horrible, horrible API
06:35 < AAA_awright> Never got around to asynchronous anything
06:36 < geNAZt> but what does nodejs make better as golang, vertx, c/c++ + libuv ?
06:37 < adrivanrex_> hey dude this is what nodejs can do
06:37 < adrivanrex_> http://apps.playcanvas.com/playcanvas/scifi/latest
06:37 < adrivanrex_> a multiplayer online counter strike
06:37 < adrivanrex_> HTML5
06:37 < geNAZt> well and vertx or golang cant do that ?
06:37 < geNAZt> its no plus for nodejs
06:37 < AAA_awright> geNAZt: Asynchronous I/O
06:37 < AAA_awright> And ECMAScript
06:37 < AAA_awright> That's it, really
06:37 < adrivanrex_> check this genazt
06:37 < adrivanrex_> http://apps.playcanvas.com/playcanvas/scifi/latest
06:38 < adrivanrex_> indeed
06:38 < adrivanrex_> it's cutting edge
06:39 < adrivanrex_> Now what can you say? haha
06:39 < adrivanrex_> http://apps.playcanvas.com/playcanvas/scifi/latest
06:40 < geNAZt> well it dont argue about languages regarding to its apps that have been built
06:40 < geNAZt> if i do so i could say php is the best on earth because facebook is built on it
06:40 < AAA_awright> And even then, not really
06:40 < AAA_awright> Facebook has their own tool to recompile to C
06:41 < adrivanrex_> genzt think about LATEST
06:41 < geNAZt> its about why is nodejs better then golang ?
06:41 < adrivanrex_> facebook is using latest language PHP
06:41 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: https://magnode.org/html2jade
06:41 < geNAZt> facebook is using hiphop 
06:41 < geNAZt> but ok
06:41 < adrivanrex_> but sooner they will be changing to NOde
06:41 < adrivanrex_> check the API
06:42 < geNAZt> so you think everyone will build nodejs apps ?
06:42 < adrivanrex_> yeah
06:42 < geNAZt> lol ok
06:42 < adrivanrex_> javascript is good for games
06:42 < geNAZt> well no :D
06:42 < adrivanrex_> i think anything
06:43 < adrivanrex_> with HTML5 javascript is king
06:43 < geNAZt> y it is so king that no game software maker uses it
06:43 < adrivanrex_> http://apps.playcanvas.com/playcanvas/scifi/latest
06:43 < adrivanrex_> they are doing it now
06:44 < jfisk1987> hey
06:44 < jfisk1987> whats a good newbie node.js book?
06:44 < jfisk1987> i need something to read for my flight tmw
06:44 < adrivanrex_> @AAA_awright thanks dude. can I add you on facebook?
06:44 < geNAZt> adrivanrex_, lol this game is so buggy
06:44 < geNAZt> that you cant walk correctly
06:44 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: I'm really just on IRC
06:44 < geNAZt> and html5 + js is king ? oO
06:45 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: If you didn't notice that page doesn't actually work yet
06:45 < adrivanrex_> @awright it's ok i got it workin gnow
06:45 < adrivanrex_> thanks for the time
06:45 < adrivanrex_> I might be able to help you someday
06:45 < adrivanrex_> if you have projects
06:46 < adrivanrex_> I'm from Philippines I need a job right now :))
06:46 < geNAZt> well i am going to find arguments that are pros in nodejs
06:46 < adrivanrex_> I'm getting old.. going 22 oh fuck
06:46 < geNAZt> why should i write my applications in nodejs ?
06:46 < Lorentz> what else are you going to write it in?
06:46 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: Go to https://magnode.org/ and click "Get Started" and try that out please
06:46 < geNAZt> golang, java, php, c
06:47 < geNAZt> some kind of thi
06:47 < geNAZt> s
06:47 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: Actually, you can follow me on GitHub too http://github.com/Acubed
06:47 < AAA_awright> hmm https
06:47 < adrivanrex_> @genazt cool
06:48 < adrivanrex_> @awright cool
06:48 < adrivanrex_> @awright where are you form?
06:49 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: You can just ping me AAA<tab>
06:49 < adrivanrex_> I see sorry noob in irc
06:49 < AAA_awright> Leading @ is unnecessary I'm not an operator here :p
06:49 < adrivanrex_> I'm using chrome irght now so tab is not working
06:58 < adrivanrex_> you have an online sample?
07:02 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: Who what?
07:02 < adrivanrex_> Your CMS
07:02 < adrivanrex_> online sample
07:02 < AAA_awright> It hosts magnode.org
07:02 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: Visit https://magnode.org/?edit
07:03 < arnorhs> it's a bit annoying on npm how the package pages are cached, so when you click on the "recently updated" ones on the front page, you only see a module that's older (in this case, 7 hours old update) https://npmjs.org/package/rarfile
07:03 < arnorhs> cache invalidation is hard
07:04 < AAA_awright> Technically it's not hard, just expensive :p
07:06 < adrivanrex_> @awright i think it's not working
07:07 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: What's not working? Can you explain what you're trying to do first?
07:07 < adrivanrex_> how to login to the admin?
07:07 < AAA_awright> Well there's no admin panel, but you don't have an account anyways
07:08 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: Try setting up your own instance of Magnode, if you have MongoDB on your computer you should have it running in 5 minutes
07:08 < adrivanrex_> what is the architecture ?
07:09 < Fuzzyma> Does anyone have an Idea to send a FormDataObj with socket.io?
07:09 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: It just needs `node` and a MongoDB server somewhere, that's it
07:09 < adrivanrex_> I'll share mine
07:09 < AAA_awright> Any dependencies are packed in
07:09 < adrivanrex_> Please don't share it :))
07:10 < adrivanrex_> I'm not really a good coder.. Just a beginner
07:11 < adrivanrex_> how do I pm you?
07:11 < AAA_awright> Uh depends on your client
07:12 < geNAZt> adrivanrex_, /msg AAA_awright your message
07:12 < AAA_awright>  /msg AAA_awright (message) should work usually
07:13 < adrivanrex_> OKey
07:13 < adrivanrex_> I send you the source code
07:13 < adrivanrex_> heheh
07:14 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: I'd use PBKDF2
07:15 < adrivanrex_> cool, The code is not really  that great
07:15 < adrivanrex_> But I just want to spend time on it.. during my free time
07:16 < adrivanrex_> what can you say about the code? hahah
07:17 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: UI is somewhat impressive, how did you design it?
07:17 < adrivanrex_> it's twitter bootsrap
07:18 < adrivanrex_> It's not really that impressive
07:18 < AAA_awright> Huh
07:18 < adrivanrex_> I'm not amazed by designs
07:18 < AAA_awright> It's more Blog-focused than what I can do right now
07:18 < AAA_awright> Which is good and bad
07:18 < AAA_awright> If I wanted a more straightforward UI I guess I could write one in Jade
07:18 < adrivanrex_> what I did is just convett HTML to jade
07:18 < AAA_awright> But I have a form builder that creates the editing forms instead
07:19 < adrivanrex_> HTML5 is what i'm talking about
07:19 < adrivanrex_> the UI is not hard to find now a days
07:19 < mkozjak> is there an easy way to display hour and minutes from within the Date object?
07:20 < adrivanrex_> awright, http://nodecms.bot.nu/
07:20 < AAA_awright> 	app.use(express.session({ secret: 'super secret string' }));
07:20 < AAA_awright> Really? Don't even do that for testing, save a secret key to a file and create the file if it doesn't exist
07:20 < adrivanrex_> you can check the admin page
07:20 < arnorhs> mkozjak: there's this http://momentjs.com/
07:20 < adrivanrex_> hahaha lol
07:21 < mkozjak> arnorhs: something i don't have to 'require' maybe?
07:21 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: You think you could try out Magnode?
07:21 < adrivanrex_> it's a super duper secret secret you know
07:21 < adrivanrex_> Sorry I'm so focused on my app right now
07:21 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: I didn't want to publish an actual string :p
07:21 < adrivanrex_> I'm seeing it as wordpress like
07:21 < geNAZt> adrivanrex_, still the localhost ?
07:21 < adrivanrex_> http://nodecms.bot.nu/
07:22 < adrivanrex_> this one
07:22 < geNAZt> still localhost ?
07:22 < adrivanrex_> it's online
07:22 < geNAZt> i can give you a vps slot if you want
07:22 < adrivanrex_> not localhost
07:22 < adrivanrex_> I already have one :D
07:22 < arnorhs> mkozjak: youcan always just use the d.getHours() && d.getMinutes() methods
07:22 < geNAZt> well its slow like hell oO
07:22 < geNAZt> Fehler 102 (net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED)
07:23 < mkozjak> arnorhs: d = new Date() ?
07:23 < adrivanrex_> refresh it now
07:23 < adrivanrex_> somethings wrong with event listerne
07:23 < geNAZt> same error
07:23 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: Is that a yes or a no?
07:23 < arnorhs> mkozjak: yeah
07:23 < adrivanrex_> @genazt give me vps :D
07:23 < mkozjak> arnorhs: i can't seem to do it like Date.getHours();
07:24 < geNAZt> what do you need ?
07:24 < adrivanrex_> hey Awright can we share VPS? :D
07:25 < adrivanrex_> @genazt I'm thinkin my server has very small memory
07:25 < arnorhs> mkozjak: yeah, you need to instantiate a date first
07:25 < adrivanrex_> I host it on a hacked VPS
07:25 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: They're not that expensive anymore
07:25 < geNAZt> well i can give you
07:25 < geNAZt> but just say me what you need
07:25 < mkozjak> arnorhs: ok :)
07:26 < adrivanrex_> Where are you from guyz? really I dont like to chat here not knowing your personal details
07:26 < adrivanrex_> :)
07:26 < arnorhs> mkozjak: if you just need to display one in the HH:mm format.. this is one hacky way to do it: new Date().toString().substr(19,5)
07:26 < ChrisPartridge> adrivanrex_: why would you host something on a hacked vps?
07:26 < mkozjak> arnorhs: thanks
07:26 < adrivanrex_> because I'm not rich
07:26 < adrivanrex_> I dont have vps
07:26 < arnorhs> adrivanrex_: i'm from iceland but live in California
07:26 < arnorhs> adrivanrex_: and you?
07:26 < arnorhs> mkozjak: np :)
07:26 < adrivanrex_> cool, I'm from philippines
07:27 < arnorhs> adrivanrex_: cool
07:27 < adrivanrex_> hey Awright can you host the source code?
07:27 < adrivanrex_> so they can see it :))
07:28 < geNAZt> adrivanrex_, do you have a git repo ?
07:28 < mkozjak> arnorhs: console.log(Date.() + ' worker #' + cluster.worker.id + ': server star ^
07:28 < mkozjak> SyntaxError: Unexpected token (
07:28 < mkozjak> wtf...
07:28 < adrivanrex_> @genazt sorry I dont have
07:28 < geNAZt> Date.() ?
07:28 < adrivanrex_> I'm still trying to know how to use github
07:28 < geNAZt> well i can give you a database, vps slots and a ftp
07:28 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: There's only so much I can do
07:29 < mkozjak> geNAZt, arnorhs: oh my, sorry, i had an error at the completely different place
07:29 < adrivanrex_> @genazt cool, send me the details
07:29 < arnorhs> mkozjak: you need to instantiate it first.. as in: var d = new Date(); console.log(d.getHours(), d.getMinutes());
07:29 < geNAZt> well send me what you need
07:29 < arnorhs> mkozjak: you can see a bunch of examples here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
07:29 < adrivanrex_> I just need a VPS
07:30 < adrivanrex_> something to host my apps
07:30 < adrivanrex_> server
07:30 < adrivanrex_> I realized the VPS run out of memory
07:30 < geNAZt> which database ? how much space ?
07:30 < adrivanrex_> lol
07:31 < adrivanrex_> hmm. it depnds on you
07:31 < geNAZt> well it depends on your app
07:31 < adrivanrex_> 4 gig memroy?
07:31 < geNAZt> lol what ?
07:32 < arnorhs> adrivanrex_: only?
07:32 < arnorhs> :)
07:32 < adrivanrex_> I dont know
07:32 < adrivanrex_> anything that will make it work
07:32 < geNAZt> if you need 4 GB ram for a blog you have a serious memory problem
07:32 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: ONLY 4G? I get by with 512MB
07:32 < ChrisPartridge> lol
07:32 < adrivanrex_> I dont really know.. Just make it work haha
07:32 < arnorhs> adrivanrex_: most cheap vspes give you between 256 and 1024.. and it's usually enough
07:33 < arnorhs> way enough
07:33 < geNAZt> well i have a 4 GB VPS
07:33 < AAA_awright> Though I must say, I used an EC2 instance with >100G RAM a few days ago
07:33 < geNAZt> but i need 2 GB by myself
07:33 < AAA_awright> It felt light driving a Formula 1 car man
07:33 < arnorhs> geNAZt: yeah, more memory is definitely nicer
07:33 < AAA_awright> er, like
07:33 < adrivanrex_> guyz i dont really know. well just make it work?
07:34 < arnorhs> AAA_awright: or maybe like driving a toyota with a really large tank of gas
07:34 < adrivanrex_> there might be some bugs on the code
07:34 < arnorhs> adrivanrex_: are you using this much memory in your app or was that just a wild guess?
07:34 < adrivanrex_> thats just a wild guess :))
07:34 < AAA_awright> arnorhs: It outperformed a dedicated, recent i7 system, whatever processor they have in those things
07:35 < arnorhs> AAA_awright: hm, interesting
07:35 < arnorhs> adrivanrex_: yeah, you probably just need 256/512 MB or something like that
07:35 < adrivanrex_> hey awright what can you say about the code?
07:35 < AAA_awright> But maybe it helped that I was working entirely off a tmpfs
07:36 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: Your code? idk, express really isn't my style
07:36 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: Also, use PBKDF2
07:36 < adrivanrex_> @genazt any VPS will do
07:36 < adrivanrex_> the higher the spec.. the better (y)
07:37 < geNAZt> what database do you need ?
07:37 < adrivanrex_> mongodb?
07:37 < adrivanrex_> do I get a root access?
07:37 < geNAZt> what
07:37 < geNAZt> no :D
07:38 < ChrisPartridge> can I have root access too?
07:38 < adrivanrex_> that's what I'm thinkin heheh
07:38 < adrivanrex_> can I still install anything?
07:39 < geNAZt> you get a ssh user yes
07:39 < geNAZt> but you cant do anything
07:39 < [AD]Turbo> yo
07:40 < adrivanrex_> how do i run the node app?
07:40 < arnorhs> [AD]Turbo: yo bro
07:41 < geNAZt> node app.js
07:41 < geNAZt> like normal
07:41 < AAA_awright> What version of v8 does Node.js require?
07:41 < adrivanrex_> alright send me details
07:46 <@konobi> AAA_awright: it's bundled
07:46 < AAA_awright> konobi: I don't use that
07:46 < AAA_awright> But I figured it out, it's 3.18
07:47 < Umren> hello, any ideas http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16456682/any-advantage-of-using-node-js-for-task-queue-worker-instead-of-other-languages
07:48 <@konobi> Umren: depends on what your worker is doing
07:48 < Umren> sending email
07:49 <@konobi> it's probably a decent option
07:49 < adrivanrex__> we
07:50 < arnorhs> Umren: one advantage would probably be that because of the modularity of most things on npm etc, it should be easy to configure/write/extend your own task queue worker to meet your needs
07:52 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex__: Starting now :p
07:52 < arnorhs> also anything network related is pretty efficient on node.. so if you have a lot of clients connecting to the worker, it should be easy on memory consumption compared to a lot of things out there.. though i guess that's not an issue in most cases
07:52 < adrivanrex__> :FD
07:53 < Umren> arnorhs, i think other languages have not worser infrastructure for this, i just want less consumption of my resources because im short on servers
08:03 < arnorhs> Umren: It sounds like node would be a good fit, then
08:04 < Uma> I am trying to use spawn..when I execute my program ..it says..events.js:72   throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event
08:05 < Uma> Does it mean that I need to handle error similar to the way I am handling data testing.stdout.on('data', callback)?
08:05 < adrivanrex__> @genazt thanks :D really helpful
08:06 < geNAZt> if you have problems write me
08:09 < Uma> hello..can anybody help me in this issue?
08:09 < geNAZt> Uma, ask
08:11 < Uma> I am trying to use spawn..when I execute my program ..it says..events.js:72   throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event
08:11 < Uma> Does it mean that I need to handle error similar to the way I am handling data testing.stdout.on('data', callback)?
08:11 < arnorhs> Uma: you can add an error handler using the childProcess.on('error',function(err) { console.log(err); });
08:11 < geNAZt> do you have a bit more of that error stacktrace
08:11 < Uma> I am new to node..so please help me
08:11 < arnorhs> if that's helpful
08:11 < geNAZt> and a bit of code ?
08:11 < Uma> Thanks..yes its helpful
08:13 < arnorhs> Uma: np
08:13 < Uma> on doing that it actually gave me error that..{ [Error: spawn ENOENT] code: 'ENOENT', errno: 'ENOENT', syscall: 'spawn' }
08:13 < geNAZt> okay
08:14 < geNAZt> ENOENT says that the programm you are calling doesnt exist
08:15 < Uma> hmm ok...  I used spawn... var filesList  = spawn('git ls-files'); and then added filesList.on...
08:15 < Uma> is there anything wrong I am doing?
08:15 < geNAZt> do you have installed the git cli ?
08:15 < geNAZt> and on which os are you running this ?
08:16 < Uma> I am running on Mac OS... I have git... when I run "git ls-files" on terminal..it gives me list..
08:16 < geNAZt> hmmmm
08:17 < geNAZt> a you use spawn
08:17 < geNAZt> try spawn('git', ['ls-files']);
08:17 <@konobi> you may need to pass through your PATH env
08:17 < Uma> ok will try
08:18 < arnorhs> Uma: or try using the full path to the git binary
08:19 < Uma> @geNazt..yes it works..thanks..so anything in the command need to be passes as argument...
08:19 < arnorhs> sweet
08:19 < geNAZt> spawn(programm, args);
08:19 < geNAZt> so i think he tried to call "git ls-files" as one programm
08:19 < geNAZt> which doesnt exist
08:20 < Uma> okk
08:37 < iksik> hello
08:37 < geNAZt> hi
08:37 < arnorhs> hey
08:40 < iksik> i'm trying to write a small tcp proxy for mssql server (perhaps someone remember my questions related to this topic yesterday)... so, proxy works (http://screencloud.net/img/screenshots/55b5f24543fb91c269a72283f2a11b20.png), but after this little exchange of packets connection hangs, does anyone have any idea, if mssql is using some other ports than (ie. default) 1433 to continue communication?
08:41 <@konobi> iksik: time to run wireshark?
08:41 < geNAZt> iksik, is this maybe a tls connection ?
08:43 < Fuzzyma> question here: socket.io has a function socket.send(). Can I send custom Data with this function (e.g. a file) and HOW can i listen to this _message_ at the server?
08:44 < iksik> geNAZt: nope
08:44 < iksik> konobi: hum
08:45 < paolooo> hi, how can I install module packages globally using package.json?
08:46 < iksik> or my proxy is not safe for communication... http://pastebin.com/CpFkU2Um 
08:46 < Fuzzyma> paolooo: npm install packagename -g
08:47 < Fuzzyma> - oh sry - missread that -.-
08:47 < paolooo> Fuzzyma: I'm using package.json
08:47 < paolooo> Fuzzyma: that's alright
08:47 < paolooo> Fuzzyma: thanks anaywa
08:47 < paolooo> Fuzzyma: thanks anyway
08:48 < geNAZt> iksik, what does the desktop app say to this ?
08:48 < iksik> hah, there is a number on that screenshot '28', when googling related error number, i've got: SQL Server Express cannot connect error: 28 - Server doesn't support requested protocol
08:48 < Fuzzyma> paolooo: see here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14657170/installing-global-npm-dependencies-via-package-json <-- quote: "Yeah, we're never going to do this."
08:48 < iksik> geNAZt: one sec, didn't tried sience sql management studio hangs
08:49 < iksik> geNAZt: same behaviour
08:49 < geNAZt> it just hangs ?
08:49 < iksik> yup
08:50 < paolooo> Fuzzyma: Thanks
08:52 < geNAZt> iksik do you have a second ip ?
08:53 < geNAZt> maybe the ports arent allowed to differ
08:53 < iksik> geNAZt: mssql is listening on 0.0.0.0:1433 and the only ip i have are 127.0.0.1 and 192.168.1.2
08:54 < iksik> hah
08:54 < geNAZt> ?
08:54 < iksik> i've used some code from the google
08:54 < iksik> https://gist.github.com/brandon-lockaby/2020839
08:55 < iksik> to setup a proxy
08:55 < iksik> and it works o.O
08:55 < iksik> so my proxy is not good
08:55 < geNAZt> well does it work ?
08:56 < iksik> it seems so
08:57 < iksik> http://screencloud.net/v/oRqf
08:57 < iksik> :D
08:57 < geNAZt> as i said :D
08:58 < geNAZt> plain text :D
08:58 < iksik> yay! ;-D
08:59 < Uma> Hi..Basica question..I want to access global variable inside callback function... But, I see each time callback is called the varible is empty..the global variable is not changing..
09:00 < Uma> How can change the global variable string each time in the callback ?
09:02 <@konobi> Uma: will depend on what variable you are talking about
09:02 < Fuzzyma> Uma: Maybe you used one variablename twice and they overwrite echaother
09:04 < Uma> I think I found it..I was doing a small mistake..thanks
09:08 < Fuzzyma> How do I listen to a message send with socket.io from the client vai socket.send()?
09:10 < paolooo> hi just got a problem --> Installation problems (npm ERR! Error: EROFS, symlink '../uglify-js/bin/uglifyjs') 
09:11 < paolooo> --> https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS/issues/453 
09:11 < paolooo> Is there any solution for this type of issue?
09:17 < iksik> geNAZt: any ideas how can i parse these packets, and be sure, that i didn't affected parsed data?
09:19 < geNAZt> well parsing in the proxy ?
09:20 < iksik> yup
09:20 < geNAZt> well you can copy the buffer
09:21 < geNAZt> so you keep the original untouched and can parse on the copy
09:23 < NoFaTe> ahoy folks
09:23 < NoFaTe> I hear buffer
09:23 < NoFaTe> s
09:23 < geNAZt> no
09:23 < geNAZt> forget that :D:D
09:23 < geNAZt> never said buffers :D
09:23 < NoFaTe> anyway
09:24 < NoFaTe> iksik, if you want to do buffer ops here's something I made that might help you

09:24 < NoFaTe> https://github.com/OrfeasZ/node-binutils
09:24 < adrivanrex__> thanks genazt it works like a charm
09:25 < adrivanrex__> @genazt you think the code is buggy?
09:25 < geNAZt> well i think you need to work on your readability of your code
09:25 < geNAZt> code style and so on
09:25 < adrivanrex__> thanks :)
09:25 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex__: You don't need the leading @ every time you want to ping someone
09:26 < geNAZt> just write my nickname
09:26 < geNAZt> irc will highlight it for me
09:26 < NoFaTe> adrivanrex__, why so iframe?
09:26 < adrivanrex__> hahah nothning make it faster

09:26 < NoFaTe> oh right
09:26 < NoFaTe> dyndns domains
09:26 < NoFaTe> nvm
09:27 < geNAZt> well he also could have one of my subdomains
09:27 < geNAZt> but he doesnt want one :D
09:27 < NoFaTe> geNAZt, what's your domain? :P
09:27 < geNAZt> cube-space.net
09:28 < adrivanrex__> it's afraid.org dns
09:28 < adrivanrex__> I dont know but It loads faster if I use it
09:29 < geNAZt> well i give you a subdomain
09:29 < geNAZt> so you can test
09:29 < NoFaTe> I see space
09:29 < NoFaTe> but I don't see cubes :o
09:29 < geNAZt> well it isnt ready yet :D
09:29 < geNAZt> it is "just" a treejs demo of space modulation
09:29 < NoFaTe> http://nofate.me
09:29 < NoFaTe> lel
09:29 < adrivanrex__> anyone can try posting
09:29 < adrivanrex__> http://nodecms.bot.nu/admin/
09:30 < geNAZt> change your email :D
09:30 < gabrielstuff> hi everyone, i've been looking in the doc of fs, but I could not find any information about watching for end of file write ? Indeed I've got the when the file is created and each time the size change but I do not get how could I get the information about file write end. Any help ?
09:30 < geNAZt> ihave@nofate.me
09:30 < adrivanrex__> I'm working on adding permalinks

09:30 < NoFaTe> adrivanrex__, I'm getting 400 Bad Req
09:30 < adrivanrex__> http://cube-space.net:8080 you can use this
09:31 < adrivanrex__> http://cube-space.net:8080/admin
09:31 < adrivanrex__> signup and post something.. Cool nodejs
09:31 < NoFaTe> oh, that kind of post
09:31 < NoFaTe> I thought HTTP Post
09:31 < NoFaTe> lolol

09:31 < geNAZt> http://nodecms.cube-space.net/
09:31 < NoFaTe> also, that shouldn't return 400
09:32 < geNAZt> the new subdomain
09:32 < NoFaTe> also your login/reg box is not centered
09:32 < adrivanrex__> thanks guys what a supportive comunity
09:32 < geNAZt> well i can write :D
09:32 < geNAZt> and it fast
09:33 < adrivanrex__> I'm working on adding themes now, and also permalinks
09:34 < gabrielstuff> anyone ?
09:34 < NoFaTe> adrivanrex__, I'm getting an alert(0); when trying to publish.
09:34 < geNAZt> yes but it publishes
09:34 < NoFaTe> oh, right
09:34 < NoFaTe> lel
09:35 < adrivanrex_> yes because it's under edvelpment
09:35 < NoFaTe> gotta love edvelpment
09:35 < NoFaTe> :3
09:35 < adrivanrex_> development haha
09:35 < NoFaTe> <3
09:36 < geNAZt> well if you have github i can give you a CD for your app
09:36 < adrivanrex_> what is a CD?
09:36 < NoFaTe> Compact Disc!
09:36 < NoFaTe> no wait...
09:36 < geNAZt> continous deployment
09:37 < gabrielstuff> again… hi everyone, i've been looking in the doc of fs, but I could not find any information about watching for end of file write ? Indeed I've got the when the file is created and each time the size change but I do not get how could I get the information about file write end. Any help ? thanks
09:37 < NoFaTe> gabrielstuff, what's the 'file write end'?
09:37 < geNAZt> https://github.com/arunoda/nariya
09:37 < gabrielstuff> when you copy a file
09:37 < gabrielstuff> the file is first created
09:38 < gabrielstuff> then the binary data are added
09:38 < gabrielstuff> you get event for that
09:38 < adrivanrex_> I have a github but it's empty
09:38 < adrivanrex_> https://github.com/adrivanrex
09:38 < gabrielstuff> but when copy ends… you just get same data, not anything more
09:38 < adrivanrex_> I'll ping you once I know how to use this
09:38 < geNAZt> ok
09:38 < geNAZt> :D
09:38 < NoFaTe> gabrielstuff, and what would you expect to get?
09:39 < gabrielstuff> something to know that I will not get anymore data :) and that the file has been copied
09:39 < NoFaTe> actually, better question
09:39 < gabrielstuff> in order to make it available as a resource
09:39 < NoFaTe> how are you copying the file?
09:39 < gabrielstuff> someone using a ftp
09:39 < gabrielstuff> drop the file
09:39 < gabrielstuff> and I'm watching the dir
09:40 < NoFaTe> :/
09:40 < NoFaTe> I'm confus
09:40 < gabrielstuff> (do not ask why ftp… i do not have the choice :( )
09:40 < NoFaTe> so basically you want your node app to know when a file has been written to the disk completely?
09:40 < gabrielstuff> yup !
09:40 < geNAZt> well you cant
09:40 < gabrielstuff> exactly
09:40 < gabrielstuff> ho :(
09:40 < geNAZt> since you dont know the original size
09:40 < NoFaTe> geNAZt, you *could*
09:40 < NoFaTe> with some hax
09:41 < gabrielstuff> yup :)
09:41 < geNAZt> the ftp server is the only one who knows that
09:41 < NoFaTe> also, I thought that FTP creates a temp file when the upload is in progress
09:41 < NoFaTe> and then renames it when done
09:41 < geNAZt> and if you have good ftp server it can handle that cases
09:41 < gabrielstuff> hum
09:41 < gabrielstuff> @geNAZT
09:41 < gabrielstuff> nice
09:41 < geNAZt> NoFaTe, no it creates the original file and writes to it
09:41 < gabrielstuff> going to see this option
09:42 < NoFaTe> geNAZt, well, some clever ones do that
09:42 < gabrielstuff> let me check for the conf
09:42 < NoFaTe> so you can resume if it was interrupted
09:42 < adrivanrex_> what are you guys up to?
09:42 < gabrielstuff> and I'll keep you posted
09:42 < gabrielstuff> !
09:42 < gabrielstuff> thanks
09:42 < NoFaTe> adrivanrex_, conquering the universe
09:42 < Nneon> is anyone able to help me with caching results from using https://github.com/elbuo8/4square in mongoosejs? I'm thinking I'll want to keep the venue data for up to 30 days.
09:42 < adrivanrex_> sounds legit :D
09:42 < NoFaTe> more or less
09:43 < NoFaTe> Nneon, isn't mongo persistent?
09:43 < geNAZt> it is
09:43 < NoFaTe> use memcached!
09:43 < gabrielstuff> ok NoFate and geNAZt
09:43 < gabrielstuff> going to check
09:43 < gabrielstuff> http://www.proftpd.org/docs/directives/linked/config_ref_HiddenStores.html
09:43 < gabrielstuff> looks nice ;) thanks
09:43 < geNAZt> NoFaTe, no no no :P
09:43 < geNAZt> redis FTW !
09:44 < geNAZt> gabrielstuff, no problem
09:44 < adrivanrex_> I hope IRC has a profile so we can view each others face :))
09:44 < NoFaTe> geNAZt, Redis is semi-persistent
09:44 < adrivanrex_> or some infos
09:45 < NoFaTe> adrivanrex_, /whois <NICKNAME>
09:45 < geNAZt> well redis can also be write through persistent
09:45 < geNAZt> well you can view me on npmjs or google+ or twitter
09:45 < NoFaTe> I'm using couchbase anyway
09:45 < adrivanrex_> haha :D
09:45 < geNAZt> https://npmjs.org/~genazt
09:46 < geNAZt> https://twitter.com/geNAZt
09:46 < adrivanrex_> :D
09:46 < Nneon> NoFaTe, geNAZt: so https://github.com/conancat/mongoose-redis-cache might be what i'm after?
09:47 < adrivanrex_> You look ng
09:47 < NoFaTe> uhmmmmm
09:47 < adrivanrex_> young
09:47 < NoFaTe> Nneon, not sure
09:47 < adrivanrex_> here's me http://facebook.com/adrivanrex
09:47 < geNAZt> 22 :D
09:48 < adrivanrex_> http://facebook.com/radrivan
09:48 < adrivanrex_> same here 22 :))
09:48 < NoFaTe> adrivanrex_, you look like a flag
09:48 < NoFaTe> ha! 18
09:48 < adrivanrex_> @nofate sorry that's my fb fan page hahaha.. lol
09:48 < NoFaTe> I beat y'all
09:48 < geNAZt> NoFaTe, can you drink beer ?
09:48 < geNAZt> :D
09:48 < adrivanrex_> Cool
09:48 < adrivanrex_> I thought I was talking with some old guys
09:48 < adrivanrex_> with beards
09:48 < adrivanrex_> LOL
09:48 < NoFaTe> geNAZt, not without permission from my mom, dad and uncle
09:48 < NoFaTe> :P
09:49 < geNAZt> :D:D:D:D
09:49 < NoFaTe> and a written consent
09:49 < NoFaTe> by the police
09:49 < Nneon> at the moment i'm using request to load a foursquare list. I just want to save that list to the database and update the data every 30 days according to foursquare terms of use.
09:50 < NoFaTe> https://twitter.com/N0F4T3
09:50 < NoFaTe> meep
09:50 < NoFaTe> Nneon, well, I guess you have two options
09:50 < NoFaTe> either use a semi-persistent store
09:50 < NoFaTe> (such as redis)
09:50 < NoFaTe> or a combination of it (like the thing you sent)
09:50 < adrivanrex_> hey genazt.. Help me continue the project It's a wordpress like nodejs CMS.. everybody will benefit :D
09:50 < NoFaTe> or clear the db and repopulate every 30d
09:51 < geNAZt> well i dont have the timie do develop everyones projects :D
09:51 < geNAZt> i still have my own ones :D
09:51 < NoFaTe> geNAZt is a development baby
09:52 < NoFaTe> no wait...
09:52 < Nneon> NoFaTe: ok i'll look into using redis. thanks
09:54 < NoFaTe> geNAZt, whatcha working on?
09:55 < geNAZt> cube-space / stargame exodus: a multiplayer 3D strategic shooter in browser (like eve online)
09:55 < NoFaTe> sounds like cubes in space
09:55 < NoFaTe> :o
09:55 < NoFaTe> also, gl
09:55 < NoFaTe> :3
09:55 < geNAZt> git-dash: An alternative to the Github Dashboard (which is ugly as heck)
09:56 < geNAZt> and node-retro: A collection of old school games (multiplayer snake, space invaders) based on appjs
09:56 < NoFaTe> "This file was created by JetBrains WebStorm (WebStorm) WS-127.27 for binding GitHub repository"
09:56 < NoFaTe> lol
09:56 < geNAZt> and i have a little company that builds nodejs apps for smaller buisness
09:57 < geNAZt> y <3 webstorm :D
09:58 < NoFaTe> I use phpStorm
09:58 < NoFaTe> due to also using it for php related jobs
09:58 < geNAZt> well i dont make php anymore :D
09:59 < NoFaTe> and I also unfortunately use IntelliJ due to stupid Univesity assignments
09:59  * NoFaTe fucking hates Java.
09:59 < dresende> ahhh Java
10:00 < zomg> NoFaTe: at least a decent IDE makes it more tolerable. Try doing it without an IDE
10:00 < zomg> :P
10:00 < dresende> no one likes it, people hate it or love it
10:00 < NoFaTe> zomg, yeah
10:00 < zomg> Especially try doing something non-trivial in Java without an IDE..
10:00 < zomg> Ugh.
10:00 < zomg> :D
10:00 < NoFaTe> I was using Eclipse for a while
10:00 < NoFaTe> but then I got pissed
10:00 < geNAZt> me too but it sucks
10:00 < NoFaTe> so I just bought IntelliJ
10:00 < geNAZt> :D
10:00 < NoFaTe> lol
10:01 < geNAZt> eclipse is slow, it needs much memory and the plugins for nodejs suck balls
10:01 < NoFaTe> + it was cheaper due to academic license
10:01 < NoFaTe> geNAZt, who even uses Eclipse for node? :o
10:01 < geNAZt> i had :P
10:01 < NoFaTe> ewww
10:01 < geNAZt> y exactly that :D
10:01 < NoFaTe> Sublime <3
10:02 < snuggl> NoFaTe: why intelliJ when they have a js-editor? =D
10:02 < snuggl> or wait, does all of them come with intellij maybe
10:02 < adrivanrex_> hey genazt I have something for you :D
10:02 < geNAZt> ?
10:02 < NoFaTe> snuggl, JS != Java
10:02 < adrivanrex_> http://apps.playcanvas.com/playcanvas/scifi/latest
10:02 < NoFaTe> + debugging
10:02 < NoFaTe> and namespaces
10:02 < NoFaTe> and blah blah
10:02 < adrivanrex_> I have the source code of that app :D
10:02 < snuggl> NoFaTe: node != java
10:02 < geNAZt> well this app sucks
10:02 < geNAZt> i cant move
10:02 < snuggl> NoFaTe: node == JS though
10:03 < geNAZt> shooting has no animation
10:03 < NoFaTe> snuggl, (JS == Node) != Java
10:03 < NoFaTe> lol
10:03 < snuggl> that would eval to true != java i guess =D
10:03 < snuggl> ah well
10:04 < NoFaTe> oh you
10:04 < NoFaTe> but Java is always false
10:04 < NoFaTe> because it's bad
10:04 < NoFaTe> so that statement is true
10:06 < snuggl> it is!
10:06 < adrivanrex__> why you say it sucks?
10:06 < adrivanrex__> it's HTML5
10:06 < NoFaTe> ESY
10:06 < NoFaTe> WAT
10:06 < adrivanrex__> build in HTML5 and javascript
10:06 < NoFaTe> so now Java == HTML5?
10:06 < snuggl> didnt you know that java applets are back
10:07 < adrivanrex__> jAVA?
10:07 < adrivanrex__> it's not JAVA!
10:07 < NoFaTe> But we were talking about Java...
10:07 < snuggl> i think he joined after that
10:07 < snuggl> i have no idea what hes replying to
10:07 < NoFaTe> lol
10:08 < adrivanrex__> I'm talking about this one
10:08 < adrivanrex__> https://www.google.com.ph/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&sqi=2&ved=0CC0QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fapps.playcanvas.com%2Fplaycanvas%2Fscifi%2Flatest&ei=Z3WLUeleooGJB4KXgfAP&usg=AFQjCNE3gEqABEEZtiQ_xZUAyBxy7AC8Qg&sig2=TN_Xm3itGKCq5X8D8AvipQ&bvm=bv.46226182,d.aGc
10:08 < adrivanrex__> http://apps.playcanvas.com/playcanvas/scifi/latest
10:08 < adrivanrex__> a multiplayer HTML5 counter strike
10:09 < geNAZt> ok
10:09 < geNAZt> why do people write those kind of games in HTML5 ?
10:10 < adrivanrex__> because HTML5 is fast?
10:10 < NoFaTe> adrivanrex__, no it's not
10:10 < geNAZt> for game development its slow as hell
10:10 < adrivanrex__> I mean very handy
10:10 < JeeppsoN> geNAZt No plugins, cross-platform etc.
10:10 < geNAZt> JeeppsoN, same as c
10:10 < geNAZt> :D
10:10 < adrivanrex__> faster than anything
10:10 < iksik> geNAZt: works perfect http://screencloud.net/v/syO9 - now only some socket.io ui is missing, with comments feature, and i'm ready to go... awesome idea hah
10:10 < geNAZt> looool
10:10 < zomg> Lol
10:10 < zomg> Describing that as Counter-Strike..
10:11 < zomg> more like "shitty 3rd person shooter"
10:11 < zomg> :D
10:11 < adrivanrex__> HAHA
10:11 < zomg> it's a nice tech demo I suppose but plays really poorly
10:11 < NoFaTe> who wants to buy me this:
10:11 < NoFaTe> http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF06b/15351-15351-3328412-241644-3328422-4194641-5336637-5336638.html?dnr=1
10:11 < adrivanrex__> My friend made that app
10:11 < JeeppsoN> I wouldn't call that a real game, it's more of a proof of concept
10:11 < geNAZt> iksik, nice
10:11 < zomg> Yeah if you were to polish it further it might be neat
10:11 < adrivanrex__> nofate, dang 15$k hahah awesome
10:11 < zomg> but for demo purposes it's quite impressive
10:11 < NoFaTe> adrivanrex__, you said you have the source
10:11 < geNAZt> zomg, it has no options
10:11 < NoFaTe> I have it too!
10:11 < NoFaTe> Ctrl+U
10:11 < geNAZt> it has no shooting holes
10:12 < geNAZt> and i can see where i am going to fire to
10:12 < adrivanrex__> nofate, yes i Have the sourc
10:12 < adrivanrex__> let me show yoU :)
10:12 < NoFaTe> adrivanrex__, read what I just said
10:12 < NoFaTe> after that
10:12 < NoFaTe> also, if that's too expensive for you you can always get me this
10:13 < NoFaTe> http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF06b/15351-15351-3328412-241644-4222584-4231377-5099257-5099259.html?dnr=1
10:13 < Fuzzyma> I hope the specification about reading raw mouse data is finished soon -.-
10:13 < JeeppsoN> What "raw mouse data" is it you want to use? Fuzzyma
10:14 < adrivanrex__> nofate, I have the sourcecode because I also helped on the development
10:14 < NoFaTe> > mouse data
10:14 < NoFaTe> > terminal
10:14 < NoFaTe> wat
10:14 < geNAZt> JeeppsoN, i think of mouse buttons, sensitifity
10:14 < geNAZt> and so on
10:14 < Fuzzyma> if you write about the demo game i mean then you always see your mouse and you cant turn a whole round
10:14 < JeeppsoN> Ah okay
10:14 < NoFaTe> ooh, html5
10:14 < NoFaTe> lol
10:14 < NoFaTe> I thought node
10:14 < Fuzzyma> thats why you only can use ohne width of your browser
10:14 < NoFaTe> I was like wat
10:15 < Fuzzyma> because browser nowadays only allow to read the mouse.x and mouse.y and there is no possibility to hold the mouse in teh middle of teh screen
10:16 < NoFaTe> Fuzzyma, chrome allows taking control of the mouse
10:16 <@Nexxy> voxeljs does it
10:16 <@Nexxy> in chrome canary
10:16 < NoFaTe> and do something like most games do
10:16 < NoFaTe> Nexxy, and in dev
10:16 <@Nexxy> just put a flash object on the page!
10:16 < NoFaTe> and by that I mean, center mouse, read movement, move view, center again
10:16 < NoFaTe> Nexxy, ew
10:16 <@Nexxy> lol
10:16 < adrivanrex__> if anyone needs the source for the counter strike game just pm me
10:16 < Fuzzyma> yes - there is a specification out there - but still not supported by other browswers
10:17 < Fuzzyma> btw: i didnt know that it works in chrome
10:17 < Fuzzyma> thx for that^^
10:17 < NoFaTe> oh shit
10:17 < NoFaTe> it's raining
10:17 < NoFaTe> lol
10:17 < adrivanrex__> haha yeah it's handy
10:17 < NoFaTe> it was 34oC yesterday
10:17 <@Nexxy> 340 Celsius?!
10:18 < NoFaTe> 34
10:18 <@Nexxy> oh
10:18 < NoFaTe> not 340
10:18 < NoFaTe> lol
10:18 < NoFaTe> hahah
10:18 <@Nexxy> it was 35 in my office the other day
10:18 < korilo> hello :=
10:18 < korilo> :)
10:18 < NoFaTe> hello korilo
10:18 < geNAZt> hi
10:18 < Fuzzyma> only 14 here..
10:18 < NoFaTe> also, whenever I look at .jar
10:18 < NoFaTe> > JAR JAR BINKS
10:19 < Fuzzyma> lol
10:19 < NoFaTe> ooh nice
10:19 < NoFaTe> they added this
10:19 < NoFaTe> http://img.pointlimit.com/16ldogf6ljrnr.png
10:19 < adrivanrex__> what games are you doing guys?
10:19 < geNAZt> yes that came in webStorm 6
10:20 < NoFaTe> (I'm on my laptop and freshly formatted)
10:20 < NoFaTe> last time I installed a jetBrains product it was simply update
10:20 < NoFaTe> so I didn't notice
10:20 < geNAZt> well i use the eap programm from jetbrains
10:20 < geNAZt> and the new features in webstorm are awesome
10:21 < NoFaTe> geNAZt, I use the betas too
10:21 < adrivanrex__> here's the source code for the counter strike web based game
10:21 < adrivanrex__> http://sphotos-c.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/p206x206/532356_175971835893592_1526207262_n.jpg
10:21 < NoFaTe> >fb
10:21 < NoFaTe> wat
10:22 < geNAZt> they use sketch for this ?
10:22 < geNAZt> oO
10:22 < adrivanrex__> yeah
10:22 < adrivanrex__> it's really really cool
10:22 < adrivanrex__> very easy to make
10:22 < geNAZt> yes and very limited
10:22 < adrivanrex__> No it's not.. I helped in the development.. check out the demos
10:23 < adrivanrex__> FPS is like made in 5 mins
10:23 < geNAZt> like the demo one ?
10:23 < geNAZt> oO
10:23 < adrivanrex__> the counterstrike game is made about 3 weeks
10:23 < adrivanrex__> playcanvas.com
10:24 < adrivanrex__> http://playcanvas.com/demos/
10:24 < adrivanrex__> ehehe cutting edge? :P
10:24 < adrivanrex__> made of pure javascript
10:24 < adrivanrex__> no flash,java etc.
10:24 < snuggl> its just GL 
10:25 < geNAZt> yes through a web api into a canvas :D
10:25 < NoFaTe> http://www.quaddicted.com/stuff/WebQuake/Client/WebQuake.htm
10:25 < NoFaTe> this is da shit
10:26 < adrivanrex__> same conecpt hehe
10:26 < geNAZt> lets see (i really love quake)
10:26 < adrivanrex__> nweiz guys thanks for chattn have to continue with my NodeCMS lol nothing special
10:26 < snuggl> no term så cant do +mlook =/
10:27 < snuggl> so
10:28 < geNAZt> NoFaTe, same again the controls are shit
10:28 < geNAZt> i never saw a js game which had good controls oO
10:28 < adrivanrex__> try playcanvas you will
10:28 < NoFaTe> geNAZt, yeah
10:28 < NoFaTe> oh and http://media.tojicode.com/q3bsp/
10:29 < snuggl> the cheating with asmjs and llvm is nice too
10:29 < NoFaTe> http://media.tojicode.com/q3bsp/ <- this one has good mouse movement
10:29 < NoFaTe> on chrome dev at least
10:30 < snuggl> but i guess orbx will have a bigger inpact on web games
10:30 < geNAZt> threejs <3
10:30 < geNAZt> its okay but still to slow for me
10:30 < snuggl> its a fun toy
10:31 < adrivanrex__> how about activision? :D
10:31 < snuggl> the publisher?
10:31 < geNAZt> what is with them ?
10:32 < snuggl> their chairman has the surname "Penisson" fyi
10:32 < adrivanrex__> they make cool games :D
10:32 < geNAZt> activision doesnt "make" games
10:32 < geNAZt> they publish them
10:32 < snuggl> they do own some studioes, but they arent making good games
10:32 < adrivanrex__> lol, assasins creed?
10:32 < snuggl> crap
10:32 < geNAZt> isnt made from them
10:32 < adrivanrex__> call of duty etc.
10:32 < NoFaTe> AC is ubisoft
10:33 < snuggl> CoD is def. crap
10:33 < geNAZt> yes
10:33 < snuggl> any game with more then 1-2M players is to stupid to be good
10:33 < NoFaTe> snuggl, not necessarily
10:33 < snuggl> ofc not, but its a trend
10:33 < RLa> it's not game but players
10:33 < adrivanrex__> how about your games?
10:34 < RLa> too many 12-olds
10:34 < RLa> and too many older ones with 12-old mindset
10:34 < geNAZt> well i love frictional games (the publisher)
10:34 < adrivanrex__> you have to make one in order to find out why it is a great game ;D
10:34 < snuggl> after a certain threshold you dont make features/games for people to love, but instead start to make features that upset the least amount of players.
10:34 < RLa> you can play online fps's as rpg's too but not with braindead players
10:35 < geNAZt> and for shooters i like bioshock & borderlands
10:50 < Riztonn> hello
10:50 < niall_obrien> Hi all
10:50 < NoFaTe> hey Riztonn and niall_obrien
10:51 < Riztonn> I would like to rent a dedicated server for my node js app but I am wondering about it is with apache because both are using the same port ?
10:51 < NoFaTe> hey geNAZt, check out what I made yesterday in like 10 min
10:51 < NoFaTe> http://www.reddit.com/r/onetruegod/comments/1dyhgv/let_our_god_embrace_the_websites_we_visit/
10:51 < NoFaTe> Riztonn, node can only bind to port 80 if run under root
10:52 < NoFaTe> or at least I think so
10:52 < geNAZt-laptop> Riztonn, well for normal you dont use apache anymore
10:52 < Riztonn> NoFaTe> I didnt get what you said, we can listen to any port with node.js ? why are you saying only ?
10:53 < geNAZt-laptop> NoFaTe, the cage in you :D
10:53 < Riztonn> geNAZt> yeah but if I want to host different website on  the same server ? I need both apache and node.js
10:53 < geNAZt-laptop> no you dont
10:53 < geNAZt-laptop> i would use nginx or varnish for that kind of job
10:53 < Riztonn> would you have interresting link of tutorials for my problem please ?
10:53 < geNAZt-laptop> till apache is to blown up for this kind of "easy" job
10:53 < NoFaTe> Riztonn, if you're using express it has a vhost module
10:54 < Riztonn> yeah I am using Express
10:54 < AAA_awright> Riztonn: You should read up some on listening to ports... Generally, at least on Linux, ports <1024 need root permissions. No, you can't listen on the same port, you have to setup a web server to act as a gateway for the appropriate URLs
10:54 < AAA_awright> A gateway accepts HTTP requests and forwards them to another server
10:55 < AAA_awright> Even load balances them
10:55 <@Nexxy> haproxy is nice
10:55 < geNAZt-laptop> does haproxy support websockets ?
10:55 < geNAZt-laptop> the latest information i have is that it breaks it
10:55 < `3rdEden> geNAZt-laptop: works fine
10:55 < NoFaTe> Does haproxy say 'ha' every time it proxies something?
10:55 < Riztonn> what about the vhost module of Express ? I am also using socket.io, will it work ?
10:55 < AAA_awright> NoFaTe: Ha
10:56 < NoFaTe> AAA_awright, AAA
10:56 <@Nexxy> ha = high availability
10:56 < geNAZt-laptop> Riztonn, socket.io and vhosts
10:56 < geNAZt-laptop> i dont know if this works fine
10:56 < `3rdEden> geNAZt-laptop: https://github.com/observing/balancerbattle
10:56 < Riztonn> geNAZt> any interesting link for me please ?
10:57 < geNAZt-laptop> `3rdEden, y u no varnish :D
10:57 < NoFaTe> Nexxy, you don't say
10:57 < `3rdEden> geNAZt-laptop: haven't tried it yet ;9
10:57 < geNAZt-laptop> http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpProxyModule
10:57 < NoFaTe> `3rdEden, is your memcached driver good?
10:57 <@Nexxy> NoFaTe, just trying to help :)
10:57 < `3rdEden> geNAZt-laptop: but HAProxy has far more superior load balancing capabilities 
10:58 < Riztonn> I am using Node.js Express and Socket.IO and I want to make it work on my server with other websites which are under apache (I make a summary of my problem
10:58 < `3rdEden> NoFaTe: it works, if that's what your aming for, but it's not "awesome"
10:58 < geNAZt-laptop> "but that was expected as Node.js sucks hairy monkey balls in SSL"
10:58 < NoFaTe> `3rdEden, it is fast and reliable for a production environment?
10:58 < geNAZt-laptop> is this still true ?
10:59 < `3rdEden> NoFaTe: yes, it's stable enough for production
10:59 < NoFaTe> is it fast enough though?
10:59 < Hounddog> hi guys, i am just thinking what would be a best practice to deploy an application with a database structure... i mean on update the database would already be existing so should i rather check if it is there already then deploy the shema or not or run this in a seperate database setup script?
10:59 < `3rdEden> NoFaTe: it can be faster, that's why i've started rewriting the criticical components of it
10:59 < Hounddog> i should put commas in my text lol
10:59 < `3rdEden> https://github.com/3rd-Eden/memcached-stream is the new parser that will be used.
11:00 < `3rdEden> in 1.0*
11:00 <@Nexxy> `3rdEden, I still have observer's unofficial mascot
11:00 < OliverJAsh> can someone suggest a way to generate a random email address?
11:00 < Riztonn> geNAZt> so you are advising me using nginx ???
11:00 < `3rdEden> Nexxy: believe it or not, i'm actually still working on observer ;%$
11:00 < OliverJAsh> basically i need a random string that is alphanumeric
11:00 < OliverJAsh> then i can append @whatever.com
11:01 <@Nexxy> I'm glad
11:01 < geNAZt-laptop> Riztonn, it depends on your use case, do you have much static files ?
11:01 < Riztonn> geNAZt> apache doesnt have a http proxy module ?
11:01 <@Nexxy> I want to see realtime mouse movement and stuff!
11:01 < geNAZt-laptop> because i use varnish because it is a fast ldb bundled with a awesome cacher
11:01 < geNAZt-laptop> Riztonn, it has but apache eats your memory like hell :D
11:01 <@Nexxy> make sure to get your architecture acrobatics out of the way first
11:01 < geNAZt-laptop> nom nom nom ram <= apache
11:01 < Riztonn> geNAZt> I dont know how big is much for you
11:01 <@Nexxy> that way you don't have to spend much time actually developing a product
11:02 < `3rdEden> Nexxy: that's what we're focusing on atm
11:02 <@Nexxy> and you will already be at scale
11:02 < `3rdEden> and is the reason why it took so long ;9
11:02 < NoFaTe> `3rdEden, interesting
11:02 <@Nexxy> for when you turn into google
11:02 < geNAZt-laptop> well currently i am running a apache proxy and i consumes about 26-32 MB ram
11:02 <@Nexxy> well as the designer of your adorable mascot I expect beta access
11:02 < `3rdEden> :D
11:02 < geNAZt-laptop> it*
11:03 <@Nexxy> ram is cheap time is expensive
11:03 < NoFaTe> `3rdEden, EPARSERFUCKUPLULZ
11:03 <@Nexxy> use node to serve your shit until you need something else
11:03 < RLa> geNAZt, i have single apache process sometimes going over 100MB
11:03 < `3rdEden> NoFaTe: The best way to describe when shit is broken  ;D
11:03 < geNAZt-laptop> Nexxy, but why should i use apache when nginx can make the same job in half of the memory ?
11:03 < NoFaTe> :P
11:03 < Lorentz> something really annoying about how my company doesn't want to upgrade devs' machines from 4gb to 8gb to save couple bucks
11:03 <@Nexxy> geNAZt-laptop, why should you use either when node will work fine?
11:04 < Riztonn> geNAZt> I didnt get why it wouldnt better using the http proxy module of apache because I think I have enough memory
11:04 < geNAZt-laptop> Nexxy, bacause i have three nodejs apps running on the same server
11:04 < geNAZt-laptop> and loadbalancing with node isnt the best
11:04 < Riztonn> and what about socket.io, what will I have to do to make it work with a http proxy module ?
11:04 <@Nexxy> you must have a lot of traffic
11:04 <@Nexxy> to need 'the best' load balancing
11:05 < geNAZt-laptop> Riztonn, you can also make it with apache, but with nginx it would be better in the efficiency
11:05 <@Nexxy> are they heterogenous apps? or just instances of the same thing?
11:05 < geNAZt-laptop> well i have ~200-400 req/s
11:05 < geNAZt-laptop> with much static things
11:05 <@Nexxy> ah
11:05 < geNAZt-laptop> so i use varnish to keep them of from the node app
11:06 <@Nexxy> when I was doing something like that
11:06 <@Nexxy> I used nginx + rsync and browserify
11:06 < Riztonn> geNAZt > what sort of efficiency ? it will be faster ?
11:06 < geNAZt-laptop> Riztonn, it uses less ram to be same amount of fast as apache
11:07 <@Nexxy> or faster?
11:07 < geNAZt-laptop> or even faster
11:07 < geNAZt-laptop> this depends on your config
11:07 < RLa> apache uses lots of memory
11:07 < RLa> expecially when you use prefork stuff
11:08 < Riztonn> geNAZt, so it is as fast as apache ?
11:08 < Riztonn> geNAZt, am I loosing lots of time going throught a proxy ?
11:08 < Riztonn> I want my app to be the fastest possible
11:08 < geNAZt-laptop> Riztonn, you can read the github repo linked in here
11:09 < geNAZt-laptop> there is a little table in it which shows the timings of an request being affected via proxies
11:09 < Riztonn> which one ?
11:09 < geNAZt-laptop> https://github.com/observing/balancerbattle#http
11:10 < Riztonn> I see but they didnt put a time without proxy
11:11 < Riztonn> I am curius about that
11:11 < geNAZt-laptop> well control is the pure nodejs app
11:11 < geNAZt-laptop> without any proxy
11:12 < NoFaTe> btw, `3rdEden, if you ever consider working on the binary protocol
11:12 < gabrielstuff> ok NoFate and geNAZt, it works perfectly :)
11:12 < gabrielstuff> thanks
11:12 < NoFaTe> you might find this package of mine useful
11:12 < NoFaTe> https://github.com/OrfeasZ/node-binutils
11:12 < gabrielstuff> the temp file system with ftp
11:12 < NoFaTe> gabrielstuff, :)
11:12 < NoFaTe> I'm currently working on a pure js client for couchbase
11:12 < NoFaTe> so yeah
11:12 < NoFaTe> `3rdEden, ^
11:13 < `3rdEden> NoFaTe: I've considered it, but I haven't because ASCII is easier to debug
11:13 < NoFaTe> lol
11:13 < `3rdEden> especially in production as you can just watch the TCP traffic
11:13 < NoFaTe> ASCII doesn't have SASL
11:13 < geNAZt-laptop> `3rdEden, is this your repo ?
11:13 < `3rdEden> So?
11:13 < `3rdEden> geNAZt-laptop: yes, thats my repo
11:13 < geNAZt-laptop> because i am interested in writing new tests for proxing
11:13 < NoFaTe> and it has a larger overhead
11:14 < `3rdEden> NoFaTe: yup, it has it's pro's and con's
11:14 < NoFaTe> `3rdEden, anyway, I'll send you a message when I have my binary parser ready for couchbase
11:14 < NoFaTe> even though it's a bit different
11:14 < NoFaTe> I guess you could use it
11:14 < `3rdEden> Writing a binary memcached parser isn't that hard
11:15 < `3rdEden> =[
11:15 < `3rdEden> =]*
11:15 < NoFaTe> Well, I'm not writing bin memc only
11:15 < NoFaTe> I'm also writing couchbase extensions and vbucket stuff and views and whatnot
11:15 <@Nexxy> vbuckets?!
11:16 < `3rdEden> k
11:16 < NoFaTe> Nexxy, vBuckets!
11:16 <@Nexxy> VBUCKETS??!?!
11:16 < NoFaTe> Nexxy, vBuckets!!!!
11:16 < geNAZt-laptop> vBuckets is some kind of clustering memcached or am i wrong ?
11:17 < NoFaTe> http://www.couchbase.com/docs/couchbase-manual-1.8/couchbase-introduction-architecture-vbuckets.html
11:17 <@Nexxy> geNAZt-laptop, vbuckets?!
11:17 < NoFaTe> Nexxy, buckets wearing V shirts
11:17 <@Nexxy> that's what I imagine
11:17 < NoFaTe> (or v-neck shirts for that matter)
11:17 <@Nexxy> and they have goatees too
11:18 < NoFaTe> and fake glasses
11:18 < geNAZt-laptop> so yes its some sort of clustering of data across multiple instances of a software
11:18 <@Nexxy> NoFaTe, real3d glasses w/ the lenses popped out
11:18 < NoFaTe> Nexxy, exactly!
11:19 < Riztonn> geNAZt> thank you for your help, I can see now the different options, but could you explain me more about the ports ? I didnt get why my app can only on the 80 on linux ? actually I am coding under windows and I did the express command to create my new project and this line was automatically added to the project : app.set('port', process.env.PORT || 3000); and when I am testing my app under 
11:19 < Riztonn> windows, I am on localhost:3000
11:20 < geNAZt-laptop> Riztonn, under linux you have two parts of port control
11:20 < geNAZt-laptop> everything that is under portnumber 1024 needs root permissions to bind to
11:21 < geNAZt-laptop> so its better to run application server above 1024 to be able to run them completly under another users uid
11:21 < donovanh_> Looking for advice on how to pipe a stream to the browser... I'm trying the twit.stream example from https://github.com/AvianFlu/ntwitter. I can console.log the stream but unsure how to expose it as a JSON response?
11:21 < geNAZt-laptop> and the proxy needs to be binded under root but the most webservers change their uid after doing that
11:21 < geNAZt-laptop> so you have one gate which proxies between your applications
11:22 < Riztonn> geNAZt> keeping using my 3000 port (above 1024) for my node.js app and use a proxy is fine ?
11:23 < geNAZt-laptop> yes
11:24 < Riztonn> geNAZt> I will have to create a user especially for my node.js app, it is better ?
11:24 < Riztonn> geNAZt> what about the logs ? because when I am running my app to test it, I can see the console logs, do you log everthing in files ?
11:25 < geNAZt-laptop> well i log in both, files and console
11:25 < geNAZt-laptop> and yes i use a new user for each application
11:26 < NoFaTe> Nexxy, you there?
11:26 < NoFaTe> Nexxyyyyyyyyyyy
11:26 <@Nexxy> NoFaTe, always
11:26 < NoFaTe> http://img.pointlimit.com/ubz4mje5l7z4e.png
11:26 <@Nexxy> hahaha
11:26 < NoFaTe> vBucket!
11:27 <@Nexxy> that's awesome
11:27 < paolooo> does anyone here ever used grunt-jade? my problem is it doesn't auto create a directory. can anybody help me about it?
11:27 < paolooo> https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-jade
11:27 < blup> i'm wondering if there's a way to persist an object server side for the duration of a client session (in order to protect its methods), without using a db...
11:28 < NoFaTe> Nexxy, took like 5 min to find a proper goatee
11:28 < NoFaTe> lel
11:28 < Riztonn> geNAZt> I am sorry I dont know a lot about linux, basically how I can throught ssh run my node js and log into file ? I should do that ? "node& app.js > logs.txt" ? then I can quit the ssh connexion but how I can see the logs in real time then ?
11:28 < leichtgewicht> paolooo Did you try the official one? https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jade
11:29 < Riztonn> I am kind of confused because I have only used node.js under windows to develop my app
11:29 < paolooo> leichtgewicht: yes, but it doesn't do it as well..
11:29 < NoFaTe> weendows
11:30 <@Nexxy> NoFaTe, tha's dedication
11:30 < NoFaTe> lol
11:30 < Riztonn> NoFaTe> yeah because I needs drivers for other stuff which have been better written under windows than linux
11:30 < NoFaTe> Riztonn, but.. but...
11:30 < NoFaTe> :'(
11:30 < NoFaTe> Nexxy, now buy me this: http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF06b/15351-15351-3328412-241644-4222584-4231377-5099257-5099259.html?dnr=1
11:31 -!- Nexxy changed the topic of #Node.js to: it's kinda like http://img.pointlimit.com/ubz4mje5l7z4e.png - http://nodejs.org - http://logs.nodejs.org - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/node.js
11:31 < Riztonn> NoFaTe> I am not going to rewrite myself the driver for my tv card for example lol but my server is under debian
11:32 < NoFaTe> tv card
11:32 < NoFaTe> wat
11:32 < NoFaTe> how is that related to node
11:32 < NoFaTe> ?
11:32 < leichtgewicht> paolooo Indeed: the plugin does only create the parent dir https://github.com/phated/grunt-jade/blob/0.5.0/tasks/jade.js#L45 but not the dir of the actual template: Bug report... https://github.com/phated/grunt-jade/blob/0.5.0/tasks/jade.js#L52
11:32 < Riztonn> NoFaTe> I thought you were laughing because I was using Windows
11:32 < NoFaTe> no, I'm using windows too
11:33 < iksik> hm, is it possible to connect with mssql server from linux nodejs?
11:33 < NoFaTe> lel
11:33 < NoFaTe> but not for production
11:34 < Riztonn> of course lol
11:36 < Guest96445> Hi.. I need small help from node.js experts..
11:36 < Riztonn> I would like to find a good article to put in production a node.js app under linux using mod_proxy of apache ? and which is also talking about logs because I would like to store the console logs in files and I would like also to be able when I am connecting throught ssh to see the console logs in real time, would know have any advice ?
11:37 < geNAZt-laptop> Riztonn, i can send you a config example for mod_proxy, and for the logs write your logs to /var/logs/<appname>/
11:38 < geNAZt-laptop> Riztonn, also write the logs out to the console and start the node application inside a screen session
11:38 <@Nexxy> NoFaTe, it seems like you'd get more performance for the money out of the cloud
11:38 < Guest96445> is it possible to start and stop a particualr node.js server from batch scripts like start.bat and stop.bat, I was able to start server, but I am not able to find out how to stop that particualr server from another batch script. Can anyone guide me please?
11:38 < NoFaTe> Nexxy, fuck the cloud, I'm doing it live!
11:39 <@Nexxy> but then you have to colocate and pay for bandwidth 
11:39 <@Nexxy> and maintenance
11:39 <@Nexxy> when stuff goes bad you don't get to just throw it out and get a new one
11:39 < NoFaTe> Nexxy, I know you silly wabbit
11:40 < Riztonn> geNAZt> yeah it would be very nice if you can send me a config example
11:40 < NoFaTe> That's why you'll buy it for me
11:40 < NoFaTe> and then I'll keep it for display
11:40 < NoFaTe> in my room
11:40 < NoFaTe> and do nothing with it
11:40 < NoFaTe> :3
11:40 <@Nexxy> except I'm broke
11:40 < NoFaTe> It's a win-win situation
11:41 < NoFaTe> Nexxy, come on, it's not THAT expensive
11:41 < NoFaTe> :P
11:41 < Riztonn> geNAZt> I see screen it to be able to get back my session when I am leaving and coming back with putty
11:41 <@Nexxy> uh huh
11:42 < geNAZt-laptop> Riztonn, http://hastebin.com/cinesuwara.apache
11:42 < geNAZt-laptop> Riztonn, correct
11:43 < geNAZt-laptop> Riztonn, screen -dmS $nodeapp name$
11:43 < geNAZt-laptop> node app.sj
11:43 < geNAZt-laptop> js* and CTRL + A + D to set it in the background
11:43 < geNAZt-laptop> and screen -r $nodeapp name$ will get it back
11:43 < Riztonn> why not "node app.js | tee file.txt" for the logs ?
11:44 < geNAZt-laptop> well this would lay the logs into the apps
11:44 < geNAZt-laptop> which can be done but i use the system logs dir for that
11:44 < geNAZt-laptop> because i like to have all my logs at one place and not to search them
11:45 < Riztonn> yeah but what I wanted to know is is it the correct way to save log ?
11:45 < geNAZt-laptop> i would say yes
11:45 < Riztonn> there is nothing to do in my express js code to save tell the app to also save the logs in the system logs dir ?
11:45 < geNAZt-laptop> but everyone can handle it on another way
11:45 < Guest96445> hi can anyone help me please?
11:46 <@Nexxy> Guest96445, most likely
11:47 < geNAZt-laptop> Riztonn, i think there are modules for that, which hook up the console.log save it to a file and print it to the console
11:47 < Guest96445> This is my problem, is it possible to start and stop a particualr node.js server from batch scripts like start.bat and stop.bat, I was able to start server, but I am not able to find out how to stop that particualr server from another batch script. Can anyone guide me please?
11:47 < Guest96445> is it possible to achieve what I am trying to?
11:48 < geNAZt-laptop> well it is possible
11:48 < Riztonn> geNAZt> but you are not using those modules ? you are doing the way I just told ?
11:48 < geNAZt-laptop> but it is not nice to do so, Guest96445 
11:48 < geNAZt-laptop> Riztonn, no i use a custom logger module to do that
11:49 < geNAZt-laptop> because if you pipe the console output into a file it doesnt show up on the console
11:49 < NoFaTe> Guest96445, you might be able to do it like most deamons do, as in start node, write pid to file and when wanting to kill it read pid from file and kill it
11:50 < Guest96445> @geNAZt-laptop..  and @NoFaTe.. thank you.. i heard it is possible using "forever" but the problem is we don't have forever  support for windows? is there any alternative?
11:50 < Riztonn> geNAZt> I think it will if you do "| tee" but doesnt seem to be an elegant way
11:50 < NoFaTe> Guest96445, what I told you
11:53 < alexwhitman> Guest96445, run it as a service: http://www.howtogeek.com/50786/using-srvstart-to-run-any-application-as-a-windows-service/
11:54 < geNAZt-laptop> Riztonn, https://npmjs.org/package/express-winston - https://github.com/flatiron/winston
11:54 < Guest96445> Thank you very much for your help :)
11:55 < NoFaTe> winston churchil
11:58 < NoFaTe> http://theonion.github.io/fartscroll.js/
11:58 < Riztonn> thank you geNAZt I am going to look into it
11:58 < geNAZt-laptop> :D:D:D:D NoFaTe 
12:00 < LegCow> any of you guys done a decent sized noSQL project with REST?
12:00 < NoFaTe> LegCow, wat
12:01 < NoFaTe> you mean have a noSQL backend and a REST frontend?
12:01 < LegCow> ehh, i'm want to rewrite my companies software using some newer more interesting techs
12:01 < LegCow> certainly web based, using node. but the back end, thought maybe i'd give noSQL a shot. must be RESTful though
12:03 < NoFaTe> LegCow, well, the only NoSQL software that I know that has builtin REST features is CouchDB
12:03 < NoFaTe> but why does it have to be RESTful anyway?
12:04 < NoFaTe> you can make most other noSQL dbs restful yourself using node.js :P
12:04 < LegCow> i like the concept. nice way to have to available to others without it getting too complicated
12:04 < LegCow> well the issues i wonder about are mostly modelling concerns
12:04 < adrivanrex_> nodecms.cube-space.net <= try this legcow
12:04 < adrivanrex_> nodejs and mongodb
12:04 < NoFaTe> LegCow, architecture related?
12:05 < LegCow> taking a look. yeah, mostly. i've just never really used noSQL for anything. all the examples available are fine, but they're not very involved
12:05 < LegCow> for example. if i have a sales order, should i nest in despatches and invoices? should they be in separate collections?
12:05 < LegCow> questions which are tricky to google, heh
12:06 < adrivanrex_> indeed
12:06 < NoFaTe> Well, LegCow, tbh I always prefer SQL for such stuff
12:07 < LegCow> quite interesting, would be very tricky to make an entire CMS
12:07 < LegCow> that's my first choice of course, but that's hardly exciting :P
12:07 < NoFaTe> due to the ability to directly relate models
12:07 < LegCow> i'm already decent with relational databases
12:07 < NoFaTe> LegCow, ever worked with views, model binding, etc?
12:08 < LegCow> NoFaTe: yeah, with a few different techs. i'd use angularjs for a frontend
12:08 < LegCow> but i've used other mvc/mvvm's
12:09 < NoFaTe> LegCow, well, it's not always about what's exciting
12:09 < NoFaTe> it's about what's functional
12:09 < NoFaTe> and also about it's performance
12:09 < LegCow> obviously, but it's for a learning experience
12:09 < NoFaTe> like for instance
12:09 < NoFaTe> I'm using NoSQL for stuff like analytics, statistics, records, etc
12:10 < NoFaTe> mostly 'static' data in a sense
12:10 < LegCow> well what relational database have you found has the best support with node?
12:10 < NoFaTe> if you get what I mean
12:10 < NoFaTe> for relational stuff I use pgsql with sequelize
12:10 < LegCow> yeah, a shame though since nosql seems to have good write speeds
12:10 < NoFaTe> http://www.sequelizejs.com/documentation
12:11 < LegCow> mentions MySQL here, it sql postgres too?
12:11 < NoFaTe> yes
12:12 < LegCow> SQL Server?
12:12 < NoFaTe> no
12:12 < LegCow> haha :P
12:12 < NoFaTe> the only SQL server driver for node is still in dev stage
12:12 < LegCow> excellent, i'll take a look at this
12:12 < NoFaTe> and is developed by MS
12:13 < NoFaTe> specifically for use with Azure 
12:13 < NoFaTe> or well, on Azure
12:13 < LegCow> yeah, i've seen. last out the gate as always
12:13 < LegCow> i've already had a play with it. MSNODESQL is bleh
12:13 < LegCow> getting it to work on azure sucked
12:13 < NoFaTe> SequelizeJS supports MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite
12:13 < NoFaTe> and it's quite good at it too
12:13 < cococo> hi
12:13 < NoFaTe> pgsql at least
12:13 < NoFaTe> hi cococo
12:14 < NoFaTe> LegCow, don't get me wrong, Azure is really powerful for deploying .NET stuff
12:14 < cococo> anyone here is making a html5 + nodejs game?
12:14 < NoFaTe> but not that powerful for node
12:14 < LegCow> awesome, maybe i'll just stick with postgre
12:14 < NoFaTe> cococo, lots of people
12:15 < cococo> I want to make a basic html5 nodejs game with anyone who know about it....
12:15 < LegCow> NoFaTe: I was tempted to actually just write something in .net, use it's shit easy semi-restful IQueryable stuff and use breeze.js
12:15 < NoFaTe> LegCow, I did enjoy making a RESTful API in ASP.NET Web API
12:16 < NoFaTe> but hosting it is expensive
12:16 < LegCow> NoFaTe: I'd feel like i'm cheating though, hehe
12:16 < LegCow> you're exposing a bit much implementation to the client but that's not always bad
12:16 < cococo> there are something I dont understand, about nodejs, all tutorial say "install nodejs" but comon! when a user open a webpage that use nodejs, he doesnt need to install anything
12:17 < NoFaTe> /facepalm
12:17 < LegCow> hehe :D
12:17 < NoFaTe> cococo, nodejs is server-side
12:17 < NoFaTe> LegCow, you can always try using this in your frontend:
12:17 < NoFaTe> http://theonion.github.io/fartscroll.js/
12:17 < cococo> that mean a client, is client and server in the sametime?
12:17 < NoFaTe> cococo, no?
12:18 < NoFaTe> the server runs a node.js app using Google's V8 engine
12:18 < LegCow> i could put that to good use
12:18 < NoFaTe> and in most cases the clients see the output
12:18 < cococo> when you join a website that use nodejs, of course, you download the HTML and javascript to make you client, where is the server?
12:20 < LegCow> you might have to do some reading there cococo, should be plenty of docs at the node.js website
12:20 < NoFaTe> cococo, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model
12:20 < cococo> let's see
12:21 < adrivanrex_> thans genazt successfully got my first GIT
12:21 < adrivanrex_> hahah
12:24 < cococo> ok ok nice link, but before I keep reading that....
12:25 < cococo> I was looking in some files from a multiplayer game project, I see they only have a file in the server directory called server.js
12:25 < cococo> where do you think that server.js file will be instaled?
12:26 < cococo> in my www.web.com/server.js ?
12:27 < NoFaTe> cococo, you cannot run node apps directly from your browser
12:28 < cococo> but I join webpages using nodejs, and I can see it works in my browser
12:28 < LegCow> node is being the webserver
12:30 < cococo> I think nodejs is to complicate to me, I will keep with AJAX
12:31 < cococo> in AJAX you know where is the server, is in the php server... is easy
12:31 < cococo> u use javascript client that comunicate with php and the php comunicate to the client...
12:31 < LegCow> it's really not that complicated. node is a server side javascript engine
12:31 < cococo> easy
12:32 < LegCow> it has an easy feature to host a directory as a webserver. you can also responde to requests manually
12:32 < cococo> but where I upload that server.js file?
12:32 < LegCow> anywhere on the hosting machines file system
12:32 < NoFaTe> cococo, you need to have a server with node installed
12:32 < LegCow> you'll then invoke that file on the host machine with node server, that'll run the file
12:32 < LegCow> likely booting up a webserver sharing out content you've specified
12:33 < NoFaTe> LegCow, he's probably confused because he's used to the essence of shared hosting plans with php
12:33 < cococo> when you say "host machine" you mean my PC?
12:33 < devoidfury> the server, where you would have put php files before. a box somewhere on the internet that your DNS is pointed at
12:33 < LegCow> yeah probably eh. yep, your machine. some hosting services will host node apps though
12:34 < cococo> now I get it
12:34 < devoidfury> the client side is no different than before, node doesn't change that
12:34 < cococo> a hosting should be able to handle nodejs
12:34 < NoFaTe> cococo, most don't
12:34 < NoFaTe> you should specifically ask if they do
12:35 < devoidfury> you'll need a VPS or a hosting provider that explicitly says they do
12:36 < cococo> so
12:37 < cococo> before I start to lost 2 or 3 weeks reading nodejs tutorial, I will have to going to my hosting webpage to see if they talk something about nodejs or javascript dunno
12:37 < cococo> well, let's see
12:38 < LegCow> if you know javascript, it doesn't take long
12:42 < SomeoneWeird> i highly doubt a normal webhost will choose to support node
12:43 < chrismatheson> i host all my node apps with AppFog (other PaaS are avaliable) its simple & free for the most part :)
12:43 < echo|> Definitely not shared hosting providers.
12:44 < mscdex> node.js hosting providers, now with Server-Side Includes!
12:45 < NoFaTe> node.js shared hosting providers, now with root access!
12:45 < NoFaTe> wait wat
12:45 < geNAZt> destroy all the apps :D
12:46 < chrismatheson> Would it be possible for your standard LAMP hosting provider to offer some sort of node.js offering? cgi or something maybe? 
12:46 < chrismatheson> without opening massive security holes i mean
12:46 < geNAZt> chrisdickinson, no not with cgi
12:46 < geNAZt> node is meant to run "alon"
12:47 < chrismatheson> yeah i was kinda wondering more about your 'casual' user who maybe just dosent want to learn 2 languages but also dosent want to use PaaS, just upload to some FTP and have code run
12:48 < chrismatheson> just theoretically, practicality is something else ;)
12:48 < devoidfury> node is a standalone interpreter/engine. the scripts aren't really "drop-in"
12:49 < devoidfury> unless the PaaS has worked in node support specifically
12:49 < peterschmidler> How can I get the console.logs in production?
12:49 < standoo> chrismatheson: i'm currently designin that
12:50 < chrismatheson> standoo: yeah ? hows it going ?
12:50 < chrismatheson> just kinda thinking out loud to be honest, im quite happy throwing small apps up to heroku, appfog, etc etc 
12:51 < standoo> chrismatheson: i've gone through 4 to 5 major rewrites
12:51 < chrismatheson> but be nice to have something to recomend when peopl get put off by that but still want ssjs
12:52 < standoo> chrismatheson: PM?
12:53 < chrismatheson> standoo sure go for it:)
13:01 < iksik> hm, how can i remove all \uXXXX characters from the string, using one regex? is it possible?
13:03 < thomblake> iksik: Well, you can do it using a short function and String.charCodeAt, but I don't know about a regex.
13:04 < RLa> they are stuff outside ascii range?
13:04 < thomblake> Oh yeah, that's a good question.  Internally, JS doesn't even know *how* the character was specified, by the spec.  That information gets thrown away.
13:05 < RLa> oh, you have problem with byte sequences
13:06 < iksik> yup, these are mostly \u0001 \u0002 \u0014 \u0017, i was trying to list them all, and replace, but sometimes i'm getting something new (new character which wasn't listed) and it's killing me now ;/
13:10 < Couto> l
13:12 < iksik> hm, ok, perhaps is there a way to generate an array of full sequence from \u0000 to \uffff ? i mean, how should i encode a number, to get this format?
13:12 < mscdex> iksik: maybe something like: str.replace(/[^\x20-\x7E]/g, '')
13:13 < iksik> mscdex: ^ will remove all characters from outside of that range?
13:13 < mscdex> yep, that's the negation symbol
13:13 < iksik> so i need to remove it ;P
13:14 < mscdex> ?
13:14 < iksik> i need to remove characters within that range
13:14 < mscdex> no, the range \x20-\x7E is ascii
13:15 < iksik> oh
13:15 < mscdex> so it's saying "anything that that is _not_ ascii"
13:15 < mscdex> remove those characters
13:16 < RLa> mscdex, what if second byte falls into ascii range?
13:16 < peterschmidler> Is there a nice way of monitoring logs and errors of a node.js app in production. I am aware of node-monitor. Is there something else, I should know about? Maybe even something with a browser-based gui ;)
13:16 < mscdex> RLa: doesn't matter
13:16 < RLa> iksik, what chars are these, cyrillic and utf-8?
13:16 < iksik> RLa some irrelevant (for me) noise from mssql protocol
13:17 < iksik> i have no idea what they are -_-
13:17 < mscdex> >> 'hello world!\u1121'.replace(/[^\x20-\x7E]/g, '')
13:17 < purr> mscdex: (string) 'hello world!'
13:17 < RLa> oh, doing low-level stuff :)
13:17 < iksik> >> '\u1121'
13:17 < mscdex> iksik: it might be binary data from the protocol itself, and not jibberish
13:17 < purr> iksik: (string) 'ᄡ'
13:17 < RLa> are those ms protocols documented
13:18 < iksik> mscdex: yeah, they are, but i don't need them, i'm parsing only a part of packets
13:18 < mscdex> i think they are now
13:18 < jaclar> peterschmidler: we are using a combination of winston and papertrail
13:18 < iksik> i don't need whole/detailed information
13:18 < peterschmidler> jaclar: Thx, I'll check them out.
13:20 < iksik> >> '\b2'
13:20 < purr> iksik: (string) '\b2'
13:20 < iksik> hm
13:20 < iksik> ;D
13:22 < geNAZt> >> "\b2"
13:22 < purr> geNAZt: (string) '\b2'
13:22 < SomeoneWeird> >> '\b2'
13:22 < purr> SomeoneWeird: (string) '\b2'
13:24 < mscdex> >> '\uc6c3'
13:24 < purr> mscdex: (string) '웃'
13:25 < mscdex> >> '\u263a'
13:25 < purr> mscdex: (string) '☺'
13:28 < JohnMcLear> is the registry ssl cert b0rked in china?
13:28 < JohnMcLear> https://registry.npmjs.org
13:28 < JohnMcLear> You have asked Nightly to connect securely to registry.npmjs.org, but we can't confirm that your connection is secure. <-- get that in the UK
13:28 < mscdex> probably a firewall issue
13:30 < mscdex> JohnMcLear: it's a self-signed cert i think
13:30 < JohnMcLear> *shrugs
13:30 < mscdex> yep, it is
13:42 < David777> g
13:43 < pachet> ood morning
13:43 < basss> Hello there, is there a way to call a function from JavaScript to node
13:43 < David888> Nice to meet you
13:43 < David777> 방가방가
13:43 < pachet> basss: how's that?
13:43 < David888> 리얼채팅이네
13:43 < pachet> basss: you mean from the client to node?
13:44 < basss> Pachet: exactly
13:44 < pachet> the function is on the server, and you want to call it from the client?
13:44 < mscdex> basss: browserify/dnode ?
13:44 < pachet> or vice versa :[
13:45 < basss> Yeah
13:45 < David777> 2224
13:45 < David777> kdkdl
13:45 < basss> mscdex ill check them out thanks
13:45 < pachet> :[
13:45  * pachet still isnt really sure what's going on
13:45 < mscdex> pachet: it's ok, the coffee hasn't settled in yet and it's not quite 10am yet
13:46 < pachet> there is truth in what you say
13:51 < Hounddog> i am a bit confused using mongoose... http://pastebin.com/t0G32czb using this i understand the schema is registered but am getting error ->MissingSchemaError: Schema hasn't been registered for model "HashTag".
13:53 < RLa> Hounddog, paste whole error with stacktrace
13:54 < Hounddog> RLa: sure one sec
13:54 < RLa> Hounddog, no need actually
13:55 < RLa> you should export your model and require 'model/hashtag'
13:55 < Hounddog> do i need to require this file also always? somehow not getting it correctly
13:55 < RLa> otherwise the file is never ran and model is not created
13:55 < Hounddog> ok i was wondering about requiring it
13:56 < Hounddog> as in no tut i have seen them reauire the model
13:56 < Hounddog> rquire i mean
13:56 < Hounddog> so i have to reauire the file everytime and also require the model with mongoose then 
13:57 < patrickfromchina> hi,anybody can tell me , www.nodebits.org work or not?
13:57 < patrickfromchina> i can not open .
13:58 < dypsilon> not work
13:59 < NoFaTe> patrickfromchina, http://www.isup.me/www.nodebits.org
13:59 < patrickfromchina> thank you,
13:59 < NoFaTe> meh, so much join/quit spam in this channel
14:00 < dypsilon> turn the messages of
14:06 < patrickfromchina> i need go, c u guys,
14:06 < patrickfromchina> :)
14:06 < therealkoopa> I'm writing some code that uses the request module, making requests to an endpoint that can return json or csv. If it's csv, then I convert it to JSON using a module that receives the stream of csv and turns it into JSON. I'm trying to figure out how to determine if the response is json or csv (without looking at the response type), and keep everything together with a stream.
14:07 < geNAZt> look for \n
14:07 < therealkoopa> I think I need something like this: request(url).pipe(<some thing that figures out if it's json or csv>) -> .pipe(csvtojsonconverter) if it's csv
14:08 < eugeneware> Anyone know when the next episode of nodeup is going to happen?
14:08 < geNAZt> therealkoopa, you can try to JSON.parse
14:08 < geNAZt> and if that fails csvtojson
14:09 < therealkoopa> That makes sense, but I'm not sure how to keep it all together with streams?
14:09 < therealkoopa> JSON.parse woudl need the entire response, right?
14:09 < geNAZt> yes
14:10 < Hounddog> RLa: thx for the help, got it working now
14:10 < therealkoopa> Would it be possible to do this with streams?
14:10 < geNAZt> well you cant be sure if its csv or json
14:11 < geNAZt> since you cont know which chars are allowed and which arent
14:11 < geNAZt> but csv can have \n which json doesnt
14:12 < therealkoopa> Um,ok
14:14 < dypsilon> Hi everyone, I'm using forever and when I call forever stopall one process still doesn't die, how do I debug what happens?
14:14 < therealkoopa> geNAZt: What if the json that is returned is a file that has \n for formatting?
14:15 < dypsilon> The process is not in the list anymore but it's still alive.
14:15 < dypsilon> It even responds on the port.
14:18 < geNAZt> json cant have \n in it
14:33 < geNAZt> does everyone know any alternative to nariya ?
14:33 < geNAZt> https://github.com/arunoda/nariya
14:39 < kenperkins> ljharb around
14:45 < dypsilon> geNAZt, fleet, maybe
14:45 < dypsilon> is nariya not good?
14:45 < geNAZt> another question: would somebody use something like nariya for development ?
14:45 < dypsilon> geNAZt, I would definitely, I'm thinking about something like it right now and looking into it
14:46 < geNAZt> nariya is 1 year old and doesnt work with the current forever module
14:46 < dypsilon> ah ok
14:46 < geNAZt> well i maybe wanted to rebuild it
14:46 < kenperkins> does anyone implement toJSON on their models?
14:46 < geNAZt> and build the same thing but on new code
14:46 < geNAZt> and the question is would someone use it or not
14:47 < dypsilon> i would, but i haven't done enough research on continous deployment with node yet
14:47 < dypsilon> i'm considering using vagrant and don't really know how it would feet into the big picture
14:48 < dypsilon> *feet = fit
14:48 < kenperkins> dypsilon: how so?
14:48  * kenperkins loves vagrant :D
14:48 < dypsilon> kenperkins, I mean, does it give you something for deployment or only for devenv?
14:49  * dypsilon doesn't really understand vagrant
14:49 < kenperkins> there are providers for Rackspace and AWS, at a minimum
14:49 < dypsilon> so it helps with deployment somehow, if it does, i'm not sure i would something like nariya or fleet
14:49 < dypsilon> but then again, not enough research yet
14:50 < dypsilon> right now i'm having this problem with forever where i start 2 process programmatically and when I stop one it kills my parent forever process and one of the child processes but not the others
14:51 < dypsilon> one child processes is still hanging without forever somewhere
14:51 < kenperkins> dypsilon: it's a HUGE boon just for dev environment
14:52 < dypsilon> kenperkins, so you mean it has nothing to do for deployment and implies no deployment scheme whatsoever?
14:52 < dypsilon> *for = with
14:52 < kenperkins> no
14:52 < kenperkins> I'm saying, for the dev benefits alone, it's a huge win
14:52 < kenperkins> it also does provisioning, but that's new and I don't have as much experience with that
14:53 < dypsilon> yeah, I will definetly use it in devenv
14:54 < dypsilon> also i'm looking at docker.io from time to time, very promising also
14:54 < nb-ben> I dislike all those process re-initiators
14:54 < kenperkins> heh docker got mentioned last night at seattle node meetup
14:55 < nb-ben> it seem like some cheap patch to cover up on a really bad bug
14:55 < dypsilon> nb-ben, not to cover up, but to minimize damage
14:55 < nb-ben> same thing
14:56 < dypsilon> nb-ben, so you'd rather have your services down?
14:56 < nb-ben> I'
14:56 < nb-ben> I'd rather either fix it properly or not use Node.js
14:56 < therealkoopa> Using the request module, you can do a req(url).on('response', function (res) { // then pipe }). Inside of the response callback, would I be able to grab the first few bytes of the response data and see if it's json or csv?
14:56 < dypsilon> nb-ben, fix what?
14:56 < nb-ben> your process dies when you don't intend for it to die
14:57 < nb-ben> fix that
14:57 < kenperkins> therealkoopa: what are you trying to do exactly?
14:57 < dypsilon> nb-ben, and have the service down until you fix it?
14:57 < nb-ben> you didn't know it's dying before you implemented it?
14:58 < therealkoopa> kenperkins: I'm trying to create a a smart function that hits some url endpoint, which returns either csv or json (but you don't know based on url or response type). If the data is csv I want to .pipe(csvstreamparser), otherwise, do something else.
14:58 < dypsilon> nb-ben, if I would, why would I ship it?
14:58 < kenperkins> therealkoopa: why not use a buffer stream to alleviate that
14:58 < nb-ben> I guess I'd take a loan if the only option would be to take it lol
14:59 < mscdex> therealkoopa: you can with streams2 or using the readable-stream module and attaching it to a streams1 stream
14:59 < dypsilon> nb-ben, you know, in the real world, stuff happens. And when it happens I want to have an email with the error and the server restarted and available till I get to fix it.
14:59 < nb-ben> but being in the development scheme for long enough, you should know better to test things before they are shipped
14:59 < therealkoopa> kenperkins: I'm looking for ideas, so I'll look into that. Something like this? https://github.com/dodo/node-bufferstream
14:59 < kenperkins> I haven't used that package but in essecense yea
14:59 < kenperkins> speling
15:00 < therealkoopa> mscdex: I'll look into doing it with streams2. Any examples of what that may look like?
15:00 < therealkoopa> I'm still trying to get streams.
15:00 < NoFaTe> translating C to Node.js
15:00 < NoFaTe> always such a joy
15:00 < dypsilon> nb-ben, ofc you test stuff, but there is a balance between testing every possible condition which might take years and reacting to events.
15:01 < mscdex> therealkoopa: you do something like `res.read(5);`, that will read the first 5 bytes of the stream. if null is returned, you have to wait for the 'readable' event on res before trying again
15:01 < NoFaTe> dypsilon, welcome to the Aperture Science Enrichment Center!
15:01 < NoFaTe> It's time to test!
15:01 < mscdex> therealkoopa: and you can even unshift the bytes back onto the stream after determining what the data type is
15:01 < dypsilon> NoFaTe, :)
15:01 < mscdex> therealkoopa: then pipe
15:01 < therealkoopa> mscdex: Oh nice!
15:02 < therealkoopa> mscdex: That's going ot be perfect!
15:02 < kenperkins> mscdex: wow I didn't know that either
15:02 < kenperkins> TIL
15:02 < mscdex> therealkoopa: i'm kind of surprised though that the response doesn't set a content-type header
15:02  * kenperkins really needs to spend more time with streams2
15:02 < mscdex> therealkoopa: like application/json
15:02 < mscdex> or text/csv
15:03 < therealkoopa> mscdex: They are going to be arbitrary user defined endpoints, and we can't bank of them setting things correctly... I wish I could, trust me.
15:03 < geNAZt> therealkoopa, how big are the requested data responses ?
15:03 < kenperkins> mscdex: would this work then? https://gist.github.com/kenperkins/5548025
15:04 < therealkoopa> kenperkins: THat's what I would do if the content type worked for me
15:04 < mscdex> kenperkins: yeah, if the content-type is set appropriately
15:04 < kenperkins> gotcha, but since content type isn't dependable, you're screwed
15:04 < therealkoopa> geNAZt: Potentially very big -- again user defined so I don't know for sure.
15:04 < geNAZt> so big that it must be streamed ?
15:04 < kenperkins> so, how can you trust the first few bytes then
15:05 < mscdex> ducktyping :-)
15:05 < kenperkins> he
15:05 < kenperkins> +h
15:05 < geNAZt> ducktyping :D:D
15:05 < NoFaTe> geNAZt, do you like ducks?
15:05 < mscdex> but yeah that would be kind of hard to do
15:05 < geNAZt> yes they are yummy
15:05 < geNAZt> :D
15:05 < mscdex> json vs csv
15:05 < NoFaTe> geNAZt, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12hWEcRaKUo
15:06 < geNAZt> wtf is this :D
15:07 < NoFaTe> geNAZt, the duck song!
15:07 < geNAZt> demonfault.cum
15:07 < geNAZt> ofc :D
15:08 < therealkoopa> Yea, if I just buffer the entire response, it's super easy JSON.parse(response) wrapped in a try/catch
15:08 < greatergrock> why did i watch that...
15:09 < geNAZt> therealkoopa, the contents of the csv
15:09 < NoFaTe> geNAZt, seen the Avengers?
15:09 < geNAZt> is it structured ?
15:09 < geNAZt> yes
15:09 < NoFaTe> geNAZt, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CNlNYIRw4g
15:09 < therealkoopa> geNAZt: No, not sure how many rows/cols
15:10 < geNAZt> no its more about the data
15:10 < geNAZt> are there [ or { in the data ?
15:10 < therealkoopa> Oh, no, we won't know
15:11 < therealkoopa> I know, this sounds ridiculous, and it is
15:11 < geNAZt> well you can buffer 2000 bytes
15:11 < geNAZt> and count the [ and {
15:11 < geNAZt> and guess what it is
15:11 < grep_awesome> or just know that until we open the data it is both [ and { at the same time
15:11 < geNAZt> or you could try to parse for "[a-z
15:12 < geNAZt> which can be json
15:12 < mscdex> well technically you could have it look like csv and json. example: "foo"
15:12 < geNAZt> yes but csv can also have ,"foo",
15:12 < geNAZt> well in json " can only be given if \:[{ is infront of
15:12 < geNAZt> right ?
15:12 < mscdex> no
15:12 < mscdex> you can have a literal string
15:13 < mscdex> or a number
15:13 < geNAZt> before a " ?
15:13 < mscdex> >> JSON.parse('"foo"')
15:13 < purr> mscdex: (string) 'foo'
15:13 < mscdex> >> JSON.parse('5')
15:13 < purr> mscdex: (number) 5
15:13 < geNAZt> yes
15:13 < mscdex> but those are also valid csv
15:13 < mscdex> :-)
15:13 < geNAZt> >> JSON.parse('[""test"]');
15:13 < purr> geNAZt: SyntaxError: Unexpected token t
15:14 < geNAZt> yes but in this case it is wayne
15:14 < geNAZt> since csv and the json representation would end in the same data
15:14 < Willox> Looks like "" should be " there geNAZt?
15:14 < geNAZt> no
15:14 < Willox> What's this then
15:15 < geNAZt> it was a show case for \,:[{ must be infront of " in json
15:15 < slicky> >> JSON.parse('emal'.split('').reverse().join());
15:15 < purr> slicky: SyntaxError: Unexpected token l
15:15 < Willox> Can't you store strings without objects/arrays in json?
15:15 < mscdex> yes
15:15 < geNAZt> you can
15:15 < Willox> So that one exception, I guess
15:16 < geNAZt> but if you do "test" in json it is the same as in csv "test" in one column
15:16 < geNAZt> it would end in (string)test
15:16 < slicky> >> JSON.stringify('emal'.split('').reverse().join(''))
15:16 < purr> slicky: (string) '"lame"'
15:16 < geNAZt> and also you can look for " in the first byte
15:17 < Willox> Looking for ways to differentiate csv and json?
15:17 < geNAZt> yes
15:17 < mscdex> and 500 is the same in json and csv
15:17 < Willox> I didn't notice that before your message
15:18 < mscdex> and quoted strings are not required in csv
15:18 < geNAZt> >> JSON.parse(500);
15:18 < geNAZt> say something !
15:18 < geNAZt> :D
15:18 < purr> geNAZt: (number) 500
15:18 < mscdex> >> JSON.parse('500')
15:18 < purr> mscdex: (number) 500
15:18 < geNAZt> >> JSON.parse(1e6);
15:18 < purr> geNAZt: (number) 1000000
15:18 < geNAZt> >> JSON.parse(0xFF);
15:18 < purr> geNAZt: (number) 255
15:18 < geNAZt> nice
15:18 < geNAZt> :D
15:18 < mscdex> >> JSON.parse(9001)
15:18 < purr> mscdex: (number) 9001
15:19 < Willox> Yes, javascript makes numbers
15:19 < jsc> I'm getting some JSON, stringifying and returning it. Console.log produces the result I was expecting, but when rendering it in express, it's an [object Object]. What am I overlooking here?
15:19 < geNAZt> >> JSON.parse("0xFF");
15:19 < purr> geNAZt: SyntaxError: Unexpected token x
15:19 < geNAZt> lawl
15:19 < slicky> >> JSON.parse(+"0xFF")
15:19 < purr> slicky: (number) 255
15:20 < mscdex> jsc: hard to say without seeing code
15:20 < slicky> >> JSON.parse(~!"0xFF")
15:20 < geNAZt> well i would look for a " in the first byte and for [{\,: infront of " in at least 2000 bytes
15:20 < geNAZt> and then decide
15:20 < purr> slicky: (number) -1
15:20 < kenperkins> whoa, did I walk into a debug spew? :D
15:21 < Willox> They are learning to number

15:24 < purr> slicky: undefined; Console: 'test\ntest'
15:25 < mscdex> jsc: returning the string from the callback function does nothing
15:25 < mscdex> jsc: you need to render from the callback
15:25 < adrivanrex_> guys any idea how to get mongodb row number
15:26 < mscdex> jsc: request() is not synchronous, just like any network i/o in node
15:26 < NoFaTe> >> require('http').get('http://google.com', function(r) { r.on('data', function(data) { console.log(data); }); });
15:26 < purr> NoFaTe: ReferenceError: require is not defined

15:26 < NoFaTe> stupid bot :(
15:26 < mscdex> or smart bot? ;-)

15:27 < purr> slicky: (string) 'test\ntest'
15:27 < slicky> :(
15:27 < jsc> mscdex: I'm pretty sure I know what you mean, but I managed to do that wrong the first time I attempted this. Second.
15:28 < mscdex> jsc: make sure you don't get your two "res" variables mixed up
15:28 < mscdex> jsc: rename one of them so you still have access to the other
15:28 < NoFaTe> >> 'IRC1CRAP'
15:28 < purr> NoFaTe: (string) '\u0002IRC1\u0002\u00034CRAP\u0003'
15:28 < mscdex> jsc: inside the callback
15:28 < NoFaTe> awwww
15:28 < NoFaTe> it just escapes everything
15:28 < slicky> yeah :D that vector isn't exploitable
15:29 < slicky> longest. compile. ever. 3 hours for wkhtmltopdf-qt compilation :X
15:29 < NoFaTe> slicky, what are you even compiling?
15:29 < slicky> wkhtmltopdf
15:29 < NoFaTe> lol
15:30 < slicky> i compiled it yesterday
15:30 < slicky> but it won't display my fonts even after I reinstalled
15:30 < slicky> so, I'm recompiling
15:30 < jsc> mscdex: I tried rendering from inside the callback the first time I attempted to fix this file, but I screwed it up. It's fine now though. Thank you!
15:31 < NoFaTe> slicky, yeah, webkit takes its time
15:31 < jsc> mscdex: However, is there a "neater" way to do this? Some way of defining data I will need inside my callback from outside it, for instance?
15:31 < NoFaTe> I used the same thing for a project of mine a few months back
15:32 < NoFaTe> even though it didn't take THAT long to compile
15:32 < slicky> running wkhtmltopdf 0.9.6 isn't cutting it anymore and 0.12.0 there doesn't seem to be a publically available static bin for
15:32 < slicky> well, I had to include a bunch of extra stuff in it
15:32 < dypsilon> is it possible to run some code (not a shell command) in a detached child process? Best case: run an anon function in a detached process..
15:32 < mscdex> jsc: it's not messy. you can assign the result to an outside variable, but you still have to wait for the request to finish
15:32 < slicky> first time it ran, it went quick... today the VM seems to be struggling
15:33 < slicky> > 5.0 load while compiling... now it's down to 0.01 :X
15:33 < slicky> prolly going to have to look at it later
15:33 < jsc> mscdex: I'm not saying it's disorganized in the way of what it's actually doing. I just meant that the legibility seems sorta low.
15:35 < mscdex> jsc: i don't it's that illegible. i should also note you'll also want to make sure you do something if there is an error with the request :-)
15:35 < mscdex> s/don't/don't think/
15:36 < jsc> mscdex: I wouldn't go as far as calling it illegible, but less legible than I might prefer. And yes, events will be handled. Thanks again for the help.
15:37 < mscdex> jsc: you could move the anonymous function out to a named function if you wanted to do that i suppose
15:37 < mscdex> *shrug*
15:39 < adrivanrex_> anyone knows how to get unique id for mongodb in int?
15:42 < squeakytoy> whats an int?
15:42 < squeakytoy> i..
15:42 < squeakytoy> so..
15:42 < squeakytoy> confusing..
15:42 < squeakytoy> in..
15:42 < squeakytoy> java..script.. world
16:04 < kenperkins> hm, does console.dir not use JSON.stringify
16:09 < mscdex> kenperkins: nope
16:09 < kenperkins> mscdex: I figured it out, because of circular, etc
16:17 < dypsilon> great, now "forever" tells me that my dead process is alive
16:17 < dypsilon> they should have called it "whatever"
16:18 < Guest21405> @isaacs is it possible to remove the user i added to the npm registry when i executed "npm adduser ..."?
16:18 < sandfox> dypsilon: forever is anything but
16:20 < dypsilon> that puts nodejitsu into pretty bad light for me
16:20 < adrivanrex_> @dypsilon indeed
16:21 < kenperkins> dypsilon: what's wrong with upstart?
16:21 < dypsilon> kenperkins, i have system v on the production server
16:21 < kenperkins> ah
16:22 < dypsilon> kenperkins, it's also a funny story, upstart would be perfect if i could run it as _not_ pid 1
16:22 < dypsilon> but i can't

16:40 < jtomasrl> if i want to implemen oauth what should be my consumer key and secret?
16:41 < grep_awesome> jtomasrl: "password" and "password"
16:42 < jtomasrl> grep_awesome: but each user must have their own or its just one of my whole app to every user?
16:43 < dypsilon> jtomasrl, do you want to implement oauth provider or oauth consumer?
16:43 < jtomasrl> yes
16:43 < jtomasrl> both
16:43 < dypsilon> thank you
16:43 < dypsilon> ah
16:44 < dypsilon> well consumer key and consumer secret are the credentials of the consumer
16:44 < dypsilon> consumer has to authenticated itself
16:44 < dypsilon> so you know it's the right consumer
16:44 < dypsilon> and not some porn site asking permission to post on behalf of the user
16:45 < jtomasrl> so i should create consumer key and secret and place them in my clients?
16:45 < dypsilon> basically yes
16:45 < dypsilon> and the provider should check them
16:46 < jtomasrl> hmm
16:47 < jtomasrl> what if my consumer (mobile app) get reverse engineered thats not very secured at all
16:47 < dypsilon> jtomasrl, that's a problem of oauth
16:47 < dypsilon> well known problem
16:47 < dypsilon> also i think there some ways around it in oauth 2
16:47 < dypsilon> *there are
16:48 < jtomasrl> ill check it later, ty

17:04 < OliverJAsh> i have an array of objects, and i need to do a map on the array. however, the map is asynchronous, so i'm using async.map.
17:04 < OliverJAsh> now i need to run two map functions on the array.
17:05 < OliverJAsh> and then my callback should receive one object from the two asynchronous mappings.
17:05 < OliverJAsh> what do i need to do?
17:05 < daniel11> hello all. I am having a problem with compound.js. I know that may be a bit off-topic but the folk in irc://irc.freenode.org:6667/#compoundjs said I should ask here. I get a "TypeError: Cannot call method 'validatesPresenceOf' of undefined" when I start my app. this in addition to a "Generator crud not found" error when using 'compound generate' from the command line.
17:11 <@isaacbw> I don't know why they told you to ask here
17:13 <@isaacbw> daniel11: are you sure you set up compound.js correctly?
17:14 < ljharb> kenperkins: yo
17:14 < kenperkins> ljharb so slow :D
17:15 < ljharb> i can't be online more than 20 hours a day :-p
17:15 < kenperkins> pshaw
17:15 < lbod> hi, is there more indepth docs on how npm publish works other than whats on the main site?
17:15 < kenperkins> ljharb: didn't realize that JSON.stringify used a toJSON method if present on an object, so yea, that's obvi best
17:16 < kenperkins> TIL
17:16 < ljharb> fa sho
17:16 < kenperkins> isn't the colloquial "fo sho"
17:16 < kenperkins> :D
17:16 < ljharb> nobody says "foe"
17:16 < lbod> just looking for info what gets published, im presuming when you publish it's whatever is in your local git repository at that time and it'll npm tag with the version that existed in package.json  i.e. there's no connection to git tags at all
17:16 < ljharb> in ruby, i usually make a "to_hash" method on everything, and then alias as_json to it - the same makes sense to me in JS (if you insist on having instances at all)
17:17 < ljharb> lbod: that's true. but if you run `npm version` in your repo, it will make a commit and a tag and bump your package.json too
17:17 <@isaacbw> lbod: that's right
17:17 < lbod> ljharb: ah so rather than using git tagging use npm instead?
17:18 < ljharb> no, use both
17:18 < ljharb> nothing's more frustrating than looking at a git repo and not being able to figure out which npm version corresponds to which sha
17:18 < lbod> so a fresh checkout of your repo and then npm publish?
17:18 < ljharb> lbod: i strongly suggest adding a tag with the version, every time you publish - it's just a convention, but it's a good one imo
17:18 < lbod> yeh im seeing that
17:19 < lbod> probably something for a grunt task
17:19 < ljharb> lbod: `npm version && npm publish && git push --tags` should do it all for you in my experience
17:19 < ironwallaby> Hi all! I'm having a weird NPM problem, I was wondering if somebody could help me figure it out.
17:20 < lbod> ok makes sense, is there an npm .ignore file too?
17:20 < ljharb> .npmignore, same syntax as .gitignore
17:20 < lbod> perfect, thanks
17:21 < lbod> oh sry, whats the best way to remove files that shoudnt have been published?
17:21 < lbod> just npm update?
17:21 < lbod> (after using the ignore)
17:22 < ironwallaby> So, I just updated to Node 0.10.5 (from 0.8.20, I think). When I try to install an NPM package, the versions that NPM lists as being available don't match what npmjs.org says. (For example, the package "aws2js" is up to 0.8.3, but if I try to "npm install aws2js@0.8.3" it complains that the most recent version is 0.6.9.)
17:23 < ironwallaby> This is very strange since it only happens on my local machine.
17:23 < ironwallaby> (From remote hosts, NPM works just fine.)

17:41 < daniel11> anyone..?
17:41 < eliofilipe> yeah
17:44 < supernaut> hi daniel11
17:45 < daniel11> I was wondering if anyone could help me with my TypeError: Cannot call method 'validatesPresenceOf' of undefined" problem when I start my app. Its most likely a directory/package management problem I expect. I am using compound.
17:46 < devoidfury> daniel11: can you provide a gist/nopaste?
17:48 < supernaut> daniel11 what version of node are you using?
17:48 < dshaw_> #nodeup is starting in a few minutes. come join the simulcast.
17:48  * dshaw_ /join #nodeup
17:49 < daniel11> of the file causing the trouble? I can but I'm not sure it would be helpful. Its fairly standard stuff direct from the manual which worked fine in a different app. I was trying to make sense of authentication and started a new app so as to get the most bare-bones structure I could. The new app wouldnt let me use the built-in generators (what?!) but I carried on regardless and got authentication working. Now I copy the code from the old app into the new app 
17:50 < daniel11> node v. 10.0
17:51 < supernaut> daniel11 it might not be comatible with v0.10
17:51 < daniel11> how would I check?
17:51 < daniel11> (* Sorry for the version typo, well-spotted!)
17:51 < eliofilipe> on package.json of compound
17:52 < daniel11>   "engines": [
17:52 < daniel11>     "node >= 0.8.0"
17:52 < daniel11>   ],

17:52 < eliofilipe> your problem is a undefined variable..
17:52 < supernaut> i am running v0.10.5 and it works
17:53 < eliofilipe> please post your code.. or at least the lines of error..

17:56 <@isaacbw> daniel11: I answered you when you first asked. Go back and make sure everything is installed correctly
17:57 < daniel11> I'm sorry isaac I must not hve seen your reply. I have just started using node.js and many things are not familiar to me. how does one make sure an app has been installed correctly or take care of dependencies which have not?
17:57 < eliofilipe> daniel11:  inspect your Poem variable..
17:59 < daniel11> elifillipe - how would I do that?

18:01 < supernaut> isaacbw: i am working on a ReadStream and I never seem to get a 'readable' event after the first one when I start the stream.  the readStream is coming from fs.createReadStream.  the file exists and I am able to read all the contents of the file initially but any new contents added to the file never seem to trigger a readable event.  Can you advise?
18:01 < daniel11> I gather the framework is responsible for instantiating the object and its methods at some earlier point..
18:01 <@isaacbw> daniel11: I would go back and make sure to follow the installation instructions word for word
18:02 <@isaacbw> they seem pretty thorough
18:02 < NoFaTe> isaacbw, do you like the binding of isaac?
18:03 < daniel11> I successfully followed the framework's instructions for the first sample app I made. That is where this previously-working code comes from. If I could find out why it is not working now, I would learn alot about node.js in the process.
18:03 <@isaacbw> NoFaTe: I didn't play it
18:04 < NoFaTe> awww
18:04 <@isaacbw> daniel11: well, what changed?
18:05 < daniel11> On my side, I added authentication. The framework's command-line utilities have never worked in this new app, despite following the frameworks instructions regarding app instantiation.
18:05 < NoFaTe> isaacbw, I heard you like hashtables
18:05 < daniel11> so it definitly looks like the framework was not installed correctly but the instruction were followed.
18:05 <@isaacbw> it sounds like you didn't set something up right in the first place
18:05 < daniel11> yes
18:06 < NoFaTe> but Javascript already has hashtables dummy!
18:06 < NoFaTe> :3
18:06 <@isaacbw> heh
18:10 < daniel11> it seems like this person has had the same problem as me: http://grokbase.com/t/gg/compoundjs/133s41qdf1/1888-add-generator-to-compound
18:10 < aslant> nodeup podcast - has it stopped?
18:10 < aslant> nope
18:11 < devoidfury> aslant: they're having some technical issues
18:14 < nilsology> just started using node the other day
18:14 < cjm> nodeup is live again now
18:17 < daniel11> update: I started a new app, following the instruction in the manual. everything works fine until passport is installed. at that point, Poem fails to instantiate, causing this error.
18:17 < daniel11> I should say rather, at that point poem is not instantiated by the framework
18:27 < daniel11> so basicly I am using compound.js, compound-passport, and passport-local. I created a sample app and tested local authentication and it works great, very impressed. however now my compound app is not running. I have isolated it to the following problem: when npm install passport -l, compound fails to instantiate my data model. the code is here - http://pastebin.com/GmrMZmgx the error is on line 2, Poem is undefined. however the exact same code worked fine 
18:31 < RobW_> Just re-installed node and I'm getting permission denied errors when trying to use globally installed node modules. Mac 10.8
18:32 < RobW_> I know I dealt with this before. Point me in the right direction?
18:36 < supernaut> how do you prevent in v0.10+ a readStream from ending? that way you can read off of the end of the stream in the future when new data arrives.
18:43 < spion> hmm, I'm tempted to create a new class inheriting from Error (CodedError) and use it from my model functions e.g. new CodedError(409, 'Username already taken')
18:44 < spion> then simply pass that as the http response code
18:45 < mattmcclure> ok I think I have a silly question, but hopefully someone can put me out my misery.
18:45 <@isaacbw> spion: you would deserve a slap on the wrist then
18:45 < spion> isaacbw, I can't think of a single reason why not to.
18:45 < spion> I'm returning errors anyway, why not add the error code :)
18:46 < mattmcclure> I'm using Wintersmith with Jade templates. I'd like to use wintersmith-kelvin (https://github.com/christophercliff/wintersmith-kelvin) for asset compilation / minification, but his only examples are using mustache and I can't figure out how to make it work using Jade syntax
18:46 < mattmcclure> Anyone have any ideas?
18:46 <@isaacbw> spion: oh, I think I misunderstood. Carry on :0
18:46 <@isaacbw> *:)
18:46 < spion> say I have the function User.create(userInfo, callback) which if the user exists should return an error
18:48 < spion> normally one would callback(new Error('User already exists'))
18:48 < spion> but if I make a class CodedError which inherits from Error but adds an error code, I can callback(new CodedError(409, 'User already exists'))
18:48 < spion> then I can directly publish any method at a http endpoint :)
18:50 < spion> however my models are then coupled with http error codes.
18:51 < spion> and that probably doesn't matter.
18:57 < RobW_> nom is supposed to alias/symlink global packages to /usr/local/bin, right?
18:57 < RobW_> nom=npm
18:57  * RobW_ nom nom nom
18:58 <@isaacbw> no
18:59 < echo|> I symlink it on my systems, I'd think it'd be a bad idea to do that by default though.
19:00 < kenperkins> does anyone have an elegant pattern for validating properties on input object (options) and early return if not found
19:01 < kenperkins> [].forEach(function(value) { … } doesn't work because you can't break out
19:03 < chapel> kenperkins: sync or async?
19:03 < RobW_> isaacbw, echo|: Thanks. IIRC there was some type of auto symlinking last time I installed yo/grunt/bower, maybe a month or two ago.
19:03 < kenperkins> chapel: well, something that doesn't add complexity for early returns with a callback(new Error(…));
19:03 < kenperkins> i.e. not having to track hasCalledBack, etc
19:04 < Willox> kenperkins, you can get out of a .forEach with an exception.. otherwise you'll have to find another way to iterate the array
19:04 < chapel> array.some allows you to return early
19:04 < kenperkins> Willox: that's what I expected, but figured it's worth a litmus check with the community
19:04 < kenperkins> chapel: oh?
19:04 < RobW_> Ah, it symlinks to /usr/local/share/npm/bin.
19:04 < chapel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some
19:05 < kenperkins> reading ty
19:05 < kenperkins> btw, shameless brag, 3 monitors is awesome
19:05 < supernaut> can anyone help with a v0.10 readable streams question?
19:05 < chapel> kenperkins: you could also just do a for loop and return callback(err)
19:50 < aslant> what was that module substack just mentioned?
19:50 < aslant> starts a new vhost for every new branch?
19:50 < aslant> on nodeup I mean
19:51 < aslant> brilliant podcast btw
19:52 < substack> aslant: https://github.com/substack/ploy
19:53 < aslant> substack: ace, thanks - quick question - any plans to get bouncy working on v0.10? If it's a matter of time, I'm up for helping. If it's not possible, or not worth it cos you're waiting for 0.12, I'll forget about it
19:54 < substack> it's possible I'm just not sure where the issue is
19:56 < aslant> substack: cool, cheers
19:59 < substack> aslant: if you can get it working that would be rad
20:05 < aslant> substack: for me too. Need to find some free time. Ploy similar to something I've been thinking about. What I really want is to have servers spin up in response to tags rather than branches. The tags being semvers. The servers register themselves as services on seaport. Then I guess I'd have a json file relating tags to subdomains. 
20:07 < aslant> anyways gotta go, thanks again for the podcast - great episode. 
20:09 < keyosk> What kind of explanations would help explain a 'http request timeout' from node -> apache on an internal lan, where the request doesn't even get to the machine (no apache access log entry) ? It doesn't happen often, and it happens when there isn't a whole lot of concurrent requests occurring. Currently the app has made 49328 requests, and 108 have come back with E_TIMEOUT
20:09 < keyosk> This is over a 12 hour period too
20:10 < RLa> by percentage that's not so bad at all?
20:10 < keyosk> No it's not
20:10 < keyosk> But it's worriesome
20:11 < keyosk> (I can live with it, the people that are paying me can't seem to..)
20:11 <@Nexxy> so they're expecting 100% uptime
20:11 < keyosk> 0.1% timeout rate and i'm getting hassled =P
20:11 <@Nexxy> perhaps you should introduce them to reality :P
20:11 < keyosk> LOL I wish I could
20:11 < RLa> i recently fixed one wp installation, it caused 1-5 lines of error log per request
20:12 < RobW_> fs.rename is working fine for me, but fs.renameSync is giving me a file not found error. Both are being called from inside a loop. Any ideas?
20:12 < RobW_> exact same starting conditions
20:12 < keyosk> I would just like to understand the issue, since it's not timeing out, it's disspearing- where the heck is it going?
20:12 < RLa> after fixing sprint (damn wp plugins!) only errors from hacking attempts are seen (1-2 per day) :)
20:14 < RLa> keyosk, maybe those are chinese bots, they will close connection in the middle of request when the page is too big, to save bandwidth
20:15 < RLa> maybe you can trace down request logs to see if the same clients cause timeouts
20:16 < Atlantic777> Hi! I'm trying to write to a socket.io socket when tcp server gets some data but I'm a bit confused... Btw, this is my day 2 with node.js and JavaScript. :D So, when I create tcp server with net.createServer(), I can define there an event handler for a connection (connection.on('data', function()...)), and when I define an event handler for sockets (like, io.sockets.on('event') function(socket) {}) I can then send data to that socket.
20:16 < Atlantic777> I need to broadcast some message whenever some data comes to that tcp server and send it to all connected clients.
20:17 < Atlantic777> and here's some code :) https://paste.lugons.org/show/vvr3Zfr0JdhFp2yTrEVD/
20:17 < Atlantic777> so, line 12 bugs me
20:18 < andredublin> io.socket.emit()
20:18 < andredublin> sorry
20:18 < andredublin> socket.broadcast.emit()
20:18 < andredublin> that will push to all clients
20:18 < andredublin> socket.broadcast.emit('eventname', function() {});
20:18 < Atlantic777> yup, but I don't have socket object in that function...
20:19 < andredublin> you can also do io.sockets.emit()
20:19 < andredublin> that is using your top level namespace io
20:19 < Atlantic777> that sounds ok, let me try :)
20:21 < Atlantic777> andredublin: io.sockets.send() should be ok, too?
20:21 < andredublin> yes i believe so
20:23 < Atlantic777> andredublin: great! it seems to work. Thanks. :)
20:23 < andredublin> Atlantic777: excellent
20:24 < johnckendall> first time on IRC, got a nodejs question regarding http auth.  we are getting a second http auth for the same resource; any clue why that would happen?
20:25 < keyosk> rla: It's my node server making internal request against my apache server
20:25 < keyosk> The timeouts that are occuring don't make sense because they never reach apache's access logs
20:26 < keyosk> It's not a chinese client, my node server IS the client
20:26 < keyosk> 2 servers in an internal lan, 2 different debian boxes
20:27 < RLa> hm, no idea then
20:28 < keyosk> Yeah... no one seems to. this issue is seriously perplexing
20:29 <@Nexxy> obviously someone is pulling the plug on the network switches
20:29 <@Nexxy> for a fraction of a second
20:29 < johnckendall> @keyosk maybe firewall, @nexxy lol
20:29 < mrmowgli>  is there any pressing reason to switch to .10x from .8x?
20:30 < adrivanrex_> hey anyone wanna help me design the plugin module for this?
20:30 < adrivanrex_>  http://nodecms.cube-space.net/
20:30 < keyosk> What would cause the firewall to drop 0.1% of the requests ...
20:31 < keyosk> Anyway, just checked with my sysadmin, firewall isn't configured to be dropping packets in this scenario
20:33 < _Renegade> Does anyone know an active Objective C chan on this net?
20:35 < johnckendall> I think node uses connection pools ... if the pool is lifo then the firewall may be timingout old connections; this would account for the fraction
20:47 < bingomanatee> are there any good javascript algorithms for finding the closest point in a 2d point collection?
20:48 < havvy> bingomanatee: It'd be the same algorithm as any other language. ;)
20:50 < bingomanatee> thanks - which one?
20:56 < pachet> bingomanatee: iterate over them and apply distance formula, hold onto the current best match
20:56 < pachet> there are a couple of shortcuts possible but that's basically it
20:56 < ingenthr> okay, just got it to the web team
20:56 < bingomanatee> Would like shortcuts - I am looking at a mesh of thousands of points. 
20:56 < ingenthr> oops
20:56 < ingenthr> wrong channel
20:57 <@isaacbw> if it's an unsorted list there's nothing you can do
20:57 <@isaacbw> it's not really a node question though
20:59 < AAA_awright> bingomanatee: There's ways to index it
20:59 < AAA_awright> So you can do it in O(log(n)) time instead of O(n) time
21:00 < bingomanatee> thats what I am looking for
21:00 < AAA_awright> One algorithm involves partioning the 2d space into a number of regions, and iterating over them in a spiral until you find a few close ones
21:01 < ipalaus> morning
21:01 < AAA_awright> bingomanatee: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-tree
21:01 < AAA_awright> Is a better one
21:01 < ipalaus> I'm installing "bob" with npm but I'm not able to run it, I get a command not found. I though it was something related with the paths, but I can't fix it with what I've found in google… any suggestions?
21:02 < AAA_awright> bingomanatee: The problem you're asking about is called http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search
21:02 < bingomanatee> thankx
21:03 < pachet> bingomanatee: this is only advantageous if you're recycling the search list for multiple checks
21:03 < AAA_awright> That goes without saying
21:03 < pachet> but AAA_awright is right, use bsp
21:03 < bingomanatee> will be doing that
21:03 < AAA_awright> You have to figure insertion time too, I mean, it goes without saying
21:05 < pachet> i think whether it goes without saying depends a lot on who im saying it to
21:06 < pachet> being that this is irc i have no idea what bingomanatee's exposure to search algs is
21:06 < bingomanatee> limited
21:06 < pachet> and i've seen people implement quadtree for one off sets just because they read on SO that it would 'make their search faster'
21:14 < RobW_> Whoo, I cannot figure this out. I console.log(fs.existsSync(somefile)); and it returns true.
21:15 < RobW_> then immediately after I fs.renameSync(somefile, other file); and I get an error. 
21:15 < RobW_> "no such file or directory"
21:15 < jjore> Permissions, cross-file system move, some part of the target directory structure might not exist...
21:16 < jjore> Imagine `mv thing-that-exist /directory/that/doesnt`
21:16 < RobW_> Ah, hmmmmm.
21:16 < RobW_> HMMM
21:18 < jjore> You can/should just be using strace to see when/if things fail.
21:18 < jjore> It's good to distrust your middleware.
21:19 < RobW_> jjore: Thank you so much.
21:19 < RobW_> I had been using copy helper methods that created the entire path, totally blanked when I switched to using fs.XXX.
21:21 < RobW_> Thanks for strace, my debugging skills in js/node are poor.
21:22 < jjore> strace is the bomb. You almost never even need to know a language or implementation to see what's actually going on.
21:23 < jjore> As in, I've walked up to totally unknown applications and been able to debug things about them just by watching that.

21:46 < happyface> how can I use setInterval and also wait for the callback to finish before setting the interval again? setTimeout is messier to use
21:48 < ljharb_work> happyface: you don't. you should avoid setInterval.
21:48 < ljharb_work> just setTimeout from your timed out function. it's not that messy.
21:48 < happyface> ljharb_work: I know, setInterval is terrible
21:49 < happyface> true

21:50 < kenperkins> sad ken is sad
21:50 < jjore> You could look at your PATH environment variable to see if your shell even finds the program you were intending.
21:51 < jjore> You could run it under the /usr/bin/env program and watch that with strace to see all the places that are being checked for your program, in-order, and see where it disagrees with your expectations.
21:52 <@isaacbw> design and launch disruptive service -> get acquired -> shut down said service
21:53 < ipalaus> jjore cool, I didn't know aboutt that command. Where npm installs the binaries?
21:53 <@isaacbw> https://blog.pinboard.in/2011/12/don_t_be_a_free_user/
21:53 < jjore> Shrug. It's your installation. Run the install again under strace and see where it put it.
21:53 < jjore> Or use the /usr/bin/find command to locate it.
21:53 < ipalaus> cool, thanks
21:54 < jjore> As in, I don't know where your thing is but those are tools you can use to debug this yourself.
21:55 < ipalaus> jjore found! thank you so much! :D

22:03 < nodweber> I've installed node.js 0.10.. but I want to test my node.js program with another version.. how Can I test it ?
22:04 < nodweber> and is there any good lib for DBUS ?
22:04 < someprimetime> kenperkins: congrats
22:04 < someprimetime> i'm sure that must feel good
22:04 < kenperkins> i left a few weeks before it happend actually, but it still feels good
22:06 < someprimetime> kenperkins: did you start it?
22:06 < someprimetime> or just worked there?
22:06 < kenperkins> emp #1
22:07 < someprimetime> so you built it
22:07 < someprimetime> (notbad)
22:07 < kenperkins> i was core team, yea
22:07 < someprimetime> did you guys take on any funding?
22:07 < someprimetime> (hope not)
22:08 < kenperkins> yea we did
22:11 < groundwater> hey guys, what's the latest hotness for unit-testing + mocking?
22:13 < kenperkins> mocha + nock (or hock)! :D
22:14 < nodweber> is there any good lib for dbus ?
22:14 < groundwater> thanks kenperkins, is nock just for mocking HTTP requests?
22:15 < kenperkins> groundwater: that's right. nock overrides http.request
22:16 <@MI6> joyent/node: isaacs v0.10 * 4b69bcf : doc: s/search.npmjs.org/npmjs.org/ - http://git.io/AzF8Bw
22:16 < kenperkins> groundwater: however hock spins up a simple http server and actually does the mocking over the wire
22:16 < groundwater> kenperkins cool, any suggestions for generic mocks?
22:16 < kenperkins> i've heard good things about sinon, but haven't used it
22:16 < kenperkins> so take that with a grain of salt
22:17 < groundwater> kenperkins will do, thanks

22:33 < chilts> ah right ... interesting (and awkward)
22:33 < chilts> I should use awk more

22:41 < robinson_k> i am currently working on https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/4932
22:41 < mh512> Hi, is chrome faster than nodejs (for basic js node)?
22:41 < robinson_k> can someone have a really short look at a first change from me if it is okay or terrible wrong?
22:42 < NoFaTe> mh512, wat
22:42 < robinson_k> somehow afraid to PR and steal the node cores team time
22:43 < mh512> NoFaTe: I ran an almost-similar piece of code in chrome and nodejs and noticed that nodejs was about 5x slower than chrome. I ran the code in nodejs without using any async/event-loop functionality.
22:43 < NoFaTe> mh512, on the same hardware?
22:44 < NoFaTe> + node takes a bit more to startup
22:44 < NoFaTe> but actual performance should be faster
22:44 < mh512> NoFaTe: yes, same hardware
22:44 < NoFaTe> mh512, what exactly did you try and how did you benchmark?
22:45 < mh512> NoFaTe: I was exploring a game tree, and I benchmarked the number of depth charges I could execute per second.
22:46 < NoFaTe> :/
22:46 < mh512> I had assumed nodejs to be faster. until someone wrote a similar piece of code in Chrome and it turned out faster...
22:46 <@Nexxy> lol
22:46 < mh512> I then dumped my code into Chrome to check.
22:47 < hatch> Hey all - I am looking for an OSS node.js app which requires multiple dependencies like mongo, redis, etc...
22:48 < robinson_k> hatch: npm-www but it uses couch as db
22:48 < mh512> Is it possible the event-loop in NodeJS affect performance? I didn't use any sys-calls/async-functionality. I am not sure what other compile flags nodejs v8 has that might make it slower.
22:48 < hatch> robinson_k, hmm that shouldn't be an issue for my purposes - any other ideas?
22:49 < robinson_k> hatch: hatch https://github.com/mozilla/openbadger
22:50 < robinson_k> oops
22:51 < hatch> robinson_k, cool, I have no idea what that is but it meets the multiple external dependency criteria :)
22:52 < hatch> robinson_k, thanks for your help
22:53 < supernaut> can someone help me with Readable Stream problem?
22:59 <@Nexxy> supernaut, quite possibly
23:03 < supernaut> Nexxy, thanks for getting back to me.
23:04 < supernaut> Nexxy, here is my question... how do you prevent in v0.10+ a readStream from ending? that way you can read off of the end of the stream in the future when new data arrives. 
23:05 < supernaut> another way of saying this would be... how can we get the 'readable' event to fire once we have reached EOF of the file -- when new data has arrived in the file.
23:06 < Rantanen> What's the preferred way to go around publishing bindings for a huge library that's pain to build? >.>
23:06 < Rantanen> Namely libjingle in this case.
23:10 < Rantanen> I'm linking it statically into native node bindings currently. The binary itself is 52M before stripping. 12M after.
23:10 <@Nexxy> supernaut, maybe you need something like slice-file?
23:10 <@Nexxy> I haven't used 0.10.x streams myself
23:11 < Rantanen> The source directory of libjingle eats 1009M >.>
23:11 < supernaut> Nexxy, i am not familiar with slice-file - what is it?
23:11 < Rantanen> So I'm guessing bundling that source to npm is out of question. :D
23:11 < Rantanen> supernaut: Isn't there some kind of autoclose: off flag?
23:12 < supernaut> Rantanen: there is.  and I am using it.  it does not stop the 'end' event from firing -- it does stop the 'close' event from happening.
23:12 < Rantanen> fs.createReadStream('pipefile', { autoClose: false }) - assuming you are after read file streams.
23:12 < Rantanen> Ah
23:13 <@Nexxy> supernaut, it lets you stream lines out of files
23:13 < supernaut> i am basically trying to build a tail -f feature into my program.
23:13 <@Nexxy> supernaut, a lot like tail -f
23:13 < Rantanen> Hm. Can't you read from it after the end event though?
23:13 <@Nexxy> but with node
23:13 < Rantanen> If it's still open.
23:13 <@Nexxy> supernaut, yep! that's what oyu want then :)
23:13 < supernaut> it is still open but the 'readable' event never fires
23:13 < Rantanen> Even if you call read(0) in the end event?
23:14 < supernaut> is slice-file on github... i did a quick google search and did not see it
23:14 <@Nexxy> type `npm home slice-file`
23:14 <@Nexxy> in term
23:14 <@Nexxy> a trick I learned from timoxley
23:15 < adrivanrex_> anyone wanna help me design how to add plugins? on my cms?
23:15 < supernaut> let me try the read(0) in the end event listener
23:15 < adrivanrex_> http://nodecms.cube-space.net/ anyone wanna help me design how to add plugins? on my cms?
23:15 < supernaut> one sec
23:16 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: You still have to try mine
23:17 < adrivanrex_> Awright, our code are not alike
23:17 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: What do you mean?
23:17 < Rantanen> Anyway. What options do I have for bundling statically linked bindings into node.js package? I should build them for different platforms, throw them in different folders such as bindings/linux/x64 and then in index.js do require based on that information?
23:17 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: And you can just type AAA<Tab>
23:17 < adrivanrex_> Im using CRC on chrome so tab is not working
23:18 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: Get a real IRC client?
23:18 < supernaut> Nexxy nice trick
23:18 < adrivanrex_> nah, I prefer this I'm sick of logging in and putting captcha
23:18 <@isaacbw> lol
23:18 < AAA_awright> Well do try and spell out people's full nicknames please >_<
23:19 < Rantanen> .. or anyone can come up with a project that is likely to have a huge dependency they are not compiling during npm install?
23:19 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: And what do you mean "code not alike"
23:19 < Rantanen> So I could look it up how they do it.
23:20 < supernaut> Rantanen:  i tried the read(0) but it didnt really do anything
23:20 < adrivanrex_> http://www.omgchrome.com/google-chrome-irc-client/
23:20 < adrivanrex_> I'm using this
23:20 < Rantanen> supernaut: 'kay. Guess it's slice-file for you then :)
23:20 < adrivanrex_> AAA wright, https://github.com/adrivanrex/NodeCMS
23:21 < supernaut> seems like a problem in streams2 if you cant build a tail -f type of feature
23:21 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: You still need to fix app.use(express.session({ secret: 'super-duper-secret-secret' }));
23:21 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: Seriously, that's a massive gaping security hole
23:22 < AAA_awright> Don't even do that for testing
23:23 < adrivanrex_> why?
23:23 < adrivanrex_> Try to hack it theN :D
23:23 < prbc> How should I organize files in a express web application? where to put the javascript files from interface?
23:23 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: that's like the root password, it lets anyone do anything
23:24 < supernaut> Rantenen: could you take a look at this gist (https://gist.github.com/subpup/5551370) maybe you could see if I am misusing readableStreams?
23:25 < Rantanen> AAA_awright: Isn't that just user session secret?
23:25 < adrivanrex_> INdeed
23:25 < adrivanrex_> :))
23:25 < adrivanrex_> nothing special :D
23:25 < myndzi> what happens if you pipe a source to a destination more than once?
23:25 < adrivanrex_> like salt
23:25 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: And what is it protecting
23:26 < adrivanrex_> the session
23:26 < Rantanen> ie. knowing it lets you hijack user sessions - sure if your admin users can run random JS commands on the server, then it's a bad thing. But as long as all the users can do is corrupt your test-db it's not as big a deal? :p
23:26 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: From?
23:26 < Rantanen> supernaut: Moment
23:26 < supernaut> ok
23:27 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: It's making sure no one can fool the server into "Oh by the way I'm the administrator" if you know the session key, anyone can sign their own session and pretend they're root >_<
23:27 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: Seriously, MASSIVE GAPING security hole, don't ever do that, not even for testing
23:28 < adrivanrex_> I see
23:30 < Rantanen> AAA_awright: Root or admin user? :p
23:30 < adrivanrex_> lol it's just a session
23:30 < AAA_awright> Whatever any user can do
23:30 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: Just a session? There's nothing bigger that I'm aware of
23:30 < adrivanrex_> they can probably get that session through XSS
23:31 < adrivanrex_> also its randomized
23:31 < adrivanrex_> It's the salted super duper secret key
23:31 < AAA_awright> What are you talking about
23:31 < Rantanen> They can fool the server into thinking "Oh by the way I'm the admin OF THIS PAGE" - which in most test environments isn't that bad of a hole. Unless the site provides admins with a server-side node.js repl or other unsecure features, it's not going to compromise the server itself. Just the page. :p
23:31 < AAA_awright> You have the SECRET key published that everyone shares
23:32 < adrivanrex_> we can change it anytime we want
23:32 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: Anyone can log in as anyone
23:32 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: Do you comprehend that fact?
23:32 < adrivanrex_> yeah, I'm thinking of how to fix that
23:33 < AAA_awright> You fix it by making it secret! Put the secret key in a different file, generate 256 bits of random data and write it if it doesn't exist
23:33 < Rantanen> supernaut: Just tested it with a simple program of my own and it seems you're right. Can suppress the close event but the stream dies anyway.
23:34 < adrivanrex_> AAA_awright how do we implement the plugins?
23:34 < supernaut> Rantanen: would you say that is a node bug?
23:34 < Rantanen> adrivanrex_: "secret: process.env.SECRET || super-duper-secret-secret" is the easiest way to get AAA_awright off your back ;)
23:34 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: I don't use plugins, I think if you need plugins you're using an obsolete modularization model
23:35 < AAA_awright> Rantanen: crypto.randomBytes(32) would do well too
23:35 < Rantanen> supernaut: Not really sure. Can't comment on that. I just tried with CAT and there seems to be an EOF as cat dies on a fifo pipe.
23:35 < AAA_awright> If you don't have a secret key file to read from, generate one and maybe write the file out
23:35 < Rantanen> AAA_awright: Not if you persist the sessions somewhere.
23:36 < adrivanrex_> also how to get a mongodb unique ID ?? int
23:36 < AAA_awright> Rantanen: That may work but it doesn't look like that's what being used, and there's other things the secret key is used for
23:36 < adrivanrex_> I mean the row number
23:36 <@isaacbw> adrivanrex_: #mongodb
23:37 < Rantanen> adrivanrex_: item._id
23:37 < supernaut> Rantanen: when you say CAT -- are you referrring to https://npmjs.org/package/catstream?
23:38 < adrivanrex_> AAA_awright a cms would be nothing without plugins.. just a thoguht
23:38 < Rantanen> supernaut: No. I'm referring to 'cat' - http://linux.die.net/man/1/cat :)
23:39 < Rantanen> I think 'type' is the equivalent in Windows.
23:39 < supernaut> ah.  i see.  but cat doesn't behave like tail -f
23:39 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: Not necessarially
23:39 < Rantanen> Yah - but 'cat' behaves as close to the ReadStreams.
23:39 < Rantanen> tail seems to poll the file.
23:39 <@isaacbw> "I'm developing a system that does absolutely nothing on its own, but at least it's extendable!"
23:39 < AAA_awright> Just because you can't imagine it doesn't mean something more innovative doesn't exist
23:39 < adrivanrex_> AAA_awright anyway I'm just imitating how wordpress works
23:39 < adrivanrex_> and trying to work it on nodejs
23:40 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: WordPress is a horrible, awful system to replicate imo
23:40 < Rantanen> isaacbw: Oh hey, I know that thing! .. it's called node.js, right? ;)
23:41 < japaniel> is anyone familiar with request?
23:41 < Rantanen> supernaut: What I'm after with the cat comparison is that I don't think you can do it with the fs streams since the OS seems to close the stream and there's not much that Node can do after that.
23:42 < Rantanen> Other than reopening it.
23:42 < Rantanen> So you could handle the 'close' event by performing another fs.createStream
23:42 < supernaut> Rantanen: but if we can prevent the close -- can we not poll the file from its last location?
23:43 < supernaut> i guess in that case we just need to get the start value for the next stream request, right?
23:43 < Rantanen> Sure - you can poll it. But you're not really polling if you're using the streams.
23:43 < japaniel> https://github.com/voxpelli/node-request <--- that request
23:43 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: https://magnode.org/doc/design#design.semantics That's how you write an extensible CMS without extensions
23:43 < supernaut> lol... but streams dont handle the use case so it seems like you are forced to poll.
23:43 < supernaut> its confusing
23:45 < Rantanen> What is yoru file a
23:45 < Rantanen> And that was wrong window. :p
23:45 < adrivanrex_> hmmm
23:47 < Rantanen> supernaut: Actually it's quite self evident why Node doesn't do it. No it's not a bug.
23:48 < Rantanen> openReadStream doesn't include behaviour to watch the file for modifications.
23:48 < Rantanen> All it does is return a stream and queue up multiple fread(3)s.
23:49 < supernaut> ok
23:49 < Rantanen> When the last fread returns EOF it would have three options. Drop the file, use inotify or similar to wait for changes or then start busylooping for more fread(3).
23:50 < Rantanen> inotify would be an extra dependency that the simple fs doesn't need. busyloop would be silly. So dropping the file is the only option it can kind of do.
23:50 < AAA_awright> adrivanrex_: So are you going to try out mine?
23:52 < adrivanrex_> I'll try it now
23:53 < adrivanrex_> AAA_awright I'm trying it now
23:53 < AAA_awright> Lemme know how it goes
23:55 < Rantanen> And still no tips on how to bundle the native component of node bindings in case of very large(tm) dependencies?
