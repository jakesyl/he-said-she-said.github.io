00:00 < othiym23> cellvia: because this is defined on the ReadableStream, it knows when it has data to push to the pipe
00:00 < othiym23> so it calls write directly, rather than calling read() on itself
00:00 < othiym23> I know it doesn't look it, but it's simpler than the old implementation
00:01 < cellvia> i didnt actually ever dig into the old one
00:01 < cellvia> i was always manually donig process next ticks and creating wrapper through pipes and stuff to deal with the problem
00:01 < cellvia> so thats taken care of inside readable stream logic now
00:02 < cellvia> very cool it listens to its own readable event
00:03 < cellvia> so i dont even ahve to call read() then since i'll be pipe
00:03 < cellvia> pipe() ing everything
00:03 < cellvia> and i jus listen for readable
00:03 < cellvia> instead of data
00:03 < cellvia> in all of my through pipes
00:04 < cellvia> i guess transform pipes
00:06 < cellvia> ill wait til the http stuff worked out to bother replacing, since thats a main thing im using it for
00:06 < cellvia> but overall this looks cool
00:07 < cellvia> i can lose some of these annoying stream librarie
00:07 < cellvia> now
00:08 < cellvia> transform stream type will be a major improvement for what im doing
00:10 < scott_switzer> I added my question to stack exchange here in case anyone wants to help :)
00:10 < scott_switzer> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14149270/passing-reference-to-db-into-routes-is-not-working-for-my-node-express-project
00:10 < othiym23> Raynos: nice find
00:10 < othiym23> I like that both spellings are included
00:11 < Raynos> othiym23: the gangster?
00:11 < othiym23> Raynos: y
00:15 < cellvia> scott_switzer dunno if this is the issue but i'd avoid using the same var names when you are nesting callbacks, ive had confusing errors and oversights from that before
00:16 < cellvia> db.open(function(err, db) {
00:17 < tnorris> TooTallNate: for the life of me, I can't figure out how to set `-O3` as default in binding.gyp. any ideas?
00:18 < cellvia> are you sure db.open even returns itself
00:18 < scott_switzer> cellvia: thanks - i actually tried changing names - to no avail.  (changed the 'db' outside the function to 'database') - still broken.
00:18 < cellvia> i would just do db.open(function(err) {
00:18 < scott_switzer> yes it returns an object
00:18 < cellvia> oh ok
00:19 < TooTallNate> tnorris: something like this I think https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/common.gypi#L59
00:19 < scott_switzer> and I checked that when I create the post object, that the DB is defined there.  Upon startup, everything looks perfect.  It is when I try to call one of the routes when the db is not defined
00:19 < TooTallNate> tnorris: you might need to put it into a "configurations": "Release" block to override node's common.gypi one right there
00:21 < tnorris> TooTallNate: and I should see it in build/basics.target.mk, right?
00:21 < cellvia> scott_switzer did you try calling the original db
00:21 < cellvia> instead of the returned object
00:21 < cellvia> a la db.open(function(err) {
00:22 < scott_switzer> just tried it - no luck
00:22 < cellvia> still undefined?
00:23 < TooTallNate> tnorris: what OS?
00:23 < cellvia> scott_switzer the post object is still properly maintained?
00:23 < scott_switzer> yes - still undefined
00:23 < cellvia> just the db is missing
00:24 < tnorris> [rant]gist new tab/space support freaking sucks[/rant]
00:24 < tnorris> TooTallNate: Here's my file: https://gist.github.com/4448797
00:24 < tnorris> -Test shows up, but -O3 doesn't
00:24 < cellvia> scott_switzer inside the constructor, is the db arriving properly?
00:24 < TooTallNate> tnorris: what OS?
00:24 < scott_switzer> cellvia:  yes
00:24 < tnorris> TooTallNate: ubuntu 12.10 x64
00:25 < TooTallNate> oh ok
00:25 < TooTallNate> well then that's a little strange, haha
00:25 < TooTallNate> you could try putting it into a common.gypi file instaead
00:25 < scott_switzer> cellvia:  constructor:[object Object]
00:25 < scott_switzer> post:[object Object]
00:25 < scott_switzer> Express server listening on port 3000
00:26 < scott_switzer> checking for the object in the constructor, and also after instantiating the post object (post.db)
00:26 < cellvia> i dunno i'd use util. inherits in all of your methods
00:26 < cellvia> and analyze the db object
00:26 < cellvia> eveywhere
00:27 < cellvia> see where the broken link is
00:27 < scott_switzer> i will look at this 
00:27 < scott_switzer> thx
00:27 < cellvia> yep
00:27 < tnorris> TooTallNate: I created a common.gypi in place of the binding.gyp and ran `node-gyp clean; node-gyp configure`. it failed. something else I'm supposed to do?
00:28 < TooTallNate> tnorris: well you also need a binding.gyp file ;)
00:28 < tnorris> heh, ok
00:28 < TooTallNate> but the common.gypi file can define some common props
00:28 < TooTallNate> like that one
00:28 < TooTallNate> "cflags"
00:32 < tnorris> TooTallNate: ok, i've updated it to look like so: https://gist.github.com/4448797
00:32 < tnorris> but now none of the cflags appear.
00:32 < PeerLesS> #war
00:32 < TooTallNate> tnorris: what version of node-gyp?
00:33 < tnorris> TooTallNate: v0.6.3
00:33 < TooTallNate> tnorris: ok ya, you need to update that for the common.gypi stuff
00:36 < tnorris> TooTallNate: ok. it was installed w/ my node v0.8.16 build/install. so I should just build/install node-gyp itself?
00:36 < TooTallNate> tnorris: are you just running `npm install`?
00:36 < TooTallNate> to invoke node-gyp that is
00:37 < TooTallNate> tnorris: you can do `npm install -g node-gyp` to get an up-to-date copy in your $PATH
00:37 < tnorris> TooTallNate: nope. in the module I'm writing I use `node-gyp clear; node-gyp configure; node-gyp build`
00:37 < tnorris> ah, that's nice.
00:37 < TooTallNate> tnorris: oh ok, so that's still npm's internal copy of node-gyp
00:38 < TooTallNate> tnorris: so take a look at https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp/wiki/Updating-npm's-bundled-node-gyp
00:46 < tnorris> TooTallNate: strange. the command on the wiki gave the following error: "prefer global node-gyp@0.6.3 should be installed with -g"
00:46 < TooTallNate> error?
00:46 < tnorris> but `sudo npm install -g node-gyp` worked for me
00:46 < TooTallNate> that should just be a warning
00:46 < TooTallNate>  /cc isaacs 
00:46 < tnorris> oops. sorry. it's a warning.
00:46 < TooTallNate> oh ok
00:46 < tnorris> but why did it say @0.6.3?
00:47 < TooTallNate> hmm ya that's strange
00:47 < TooTallNate> you did the @latest part?
00:47 < TooTallNate> isaacs: does @latest respect the package.json-specified version?
00:47 < tnorris> `sudo npm explore npm -g -- npm install node-gyp@latest`
00:48 < tnorris> ^ what I ran
00:48 < TooTallNate> ya, i guess @lastest doesn't do what I was hoping
00:49 < TooTallNate> tnorris: so instead of @lastest, do @`npm info node-gyp version`
00:49 < CoverSlide> is @lastest laster than @latest?
00:50 < mistertwig> hello friends
00:51 < javagoogles> that node-dev package says to install growlnotify . i have growl 2 installed on my machine, but i can't find the right download to install the lib on http://growl.info/downloads#generaldownloads
00:52 < CoverSlide> maybe you need
00:52 < CoverSlide> GrowlNotify 2.0 
00:52 < CoverSlide> For use with Growl 2.0 
00:52  * CoverSlide shrugs
00:52 < CoverSlide> it's perplexing
00:52 < tnorris> TooTallNate: ugh. not sure what's going on but `npm info node-gyp` -> "ERR! Error: unauthorized Name or password is incorrect.: node-gyp"
00:52 < javagoogles> CoverSlide: there's no mention of 2.0 here http://growl.info/extras.php#growlnotify
00:52 < TooTallNate> tnorris: maybe just type @0.8.2 instead
00:53 < TooTallNate> i'm not sure what username or password has to do with anything
00:54 < tnorris> TooTallNate: here's the full thing: https://gist.github.com/4448953
00:54 < tnorris> no matter what I type I get the same usr/pass error.
00:55 < TooTallNate> tnorris: forget "info", just do the install aprt
00:55 < TooTallNate> part
00:55 < tnorris> TooTallNate: it's happening with any package I'm trying to check/install.
00:55 < tnorris> just tried to install one of my own packages and it happened.
00:57 < tnorris> TooTallNate: ok. for some reason my .npmrc was jacked up. just reset it and added myself again. working better now.
00:58 < TooTallNate> haha weird
00:58 < CoverSlide> javagoogles: here's a suggestion: try one. if it doesn't work, try the other
00:58 < javagoogles> CoverSlide: sorry i'm on crack it was there the whole time
00:59 < javagoogles> man that's awesome
01:00 < christo_m> Does anyone here play LoL and able to get this to connect ? https://github.com/nagash/node-lol-client
01:01 < xer0x> christo_m: neat a lol client!
01:02 < xer0x> christo_m: weird that you have to set the Lol client version to match the current build..  that's gonna trip folks up
01:02 < christo_m> xer0x: ya, the guys at lolking arent giving up their trade secrets for how their getting summoner stats
01:02 < christo_m> xer0x: i did that already , set to 1.73.12_12_18_17_01
01:03 < xer0x> christo_m: there's a iPhone client that logs into chat too. I wonder what library they use
01:03 < christo_m> xer0x: i already have a bot able to chat on the pvp.net networks.. send/recv all that
01:03 < christo_m> xer0x: its just built with the XMPP protocol, 
01:04 < xer0x> christo_m: ah
01:04 < christo_m> but man, that adobe air client.. using rtmp .. had to wireshark for that, and then realized theres some existing work out there
01:04 < christo_m> but it doesnt look like i can get this one to connect, something abouta missing login token
01:05 < xer0x> bummer
01:05 < xer0x> wiresharkin' it sounds like the way to go
01:05 < tnorris> TooTallNate: sorry, one more question. know why i'm getting the following error: https://gist.github.com/4449051
01:05 < christo_m> xer0x: https://code.google.com/p/lolrtmpsclient/source/browse/trunk/#trunk%2Fcom%2Fgvaneyck%2Frtmp , i found this java one also but.. it looks like too much to leverage, not sure how id integrate it with my current RoR setup.. unless i bust out jruby but i digress. Just wondering if someone here is well versed enough with node.js to check out that project
01:06 < christo_m> im just kinda learning on the go here
01:06 < TooTallNate> tnorris: should be fine ~ ignore it
01:08 < niggler> TooTallNate any way to expedite a bug fix getting committed to the master?
01:09 < TooTallNate> niggler: which bug?
01:09 < TooTallNate>  / patch
01:09 < tnorris> niggler: if you're talking about updating your npm package, I usually throw on a quick fix number, e.g. "0.1.3-2"
01:09 < niggler> https://github.com/joyent/node/pull/4513
01:10 < christo_m> xer0x: ?? you give up on me
01:10 < christo_m> i guess i gotta do it live
01:11 < TooTallNate> niggler: have you signed the CLA?
01:11 < niggler> yeah its that google thing right?
01:12 < niggler> lol the item that stood out the most was "powered by google docs"
01:12 < TooTallNate> ya that thing
01:12 < niggler> one confusion, though, is that i though e-signatures had to be a person typing their name
01:12 < niggler> and not just "I AGREE"
01:13 < xer0x> christo_m: yep
01:13 < christo_m> xer0x: i need more friends that know things
01:14 < christo_m> well, just more friends. but still, this is more intense than camping
01:14 < xer0x> ha
01:15 < xer0x> christo_m: you tried using Curl to login to LoL yet?
01:15 < christo_m> xer0x: of course not, that would make sens
01:15 < TooTallNate> niggler: google knows your name
01:15 < christo_m> sense* XD, one moment
01:16 < xer0x> christo_m: ./lib/login-queue.coffee is sending what looks like an HTTPS request to /login-queue/rest/...etc
01:16 < christo_m> xer0x: thats what i was looking at
01:16 < christo_m> xer0x: that path is relative though, it isnt something LoL-side
01:16 < niggler> my question TooTallNate focused on what constitued an e-signature
01:16 < christo_m> actually sorry
01:16 < christo_m> you're right, 
01:16 < tnorris> TooTallNate: have to jam, but filed node-gyp#178. Still can't change `-O` cflags for Release even after upgrade.
01:16 < xer0x> christo_m: it's LoL side ;)
01:17 < tnorris> funny thing is that they are being added to Debug.
01:17 < xer0x> christo_m: that's their API
01:17 < christo_m> xer0x: ya but over port 443, dont think i can use curl
01:17 < christo_m> lq.na1.lol.riotgames.com/login-queue/rest/queue/authenticate
01:17 < xer0x> Since it's using HTTPS it is going to hide from wireshark
01:18 < xer0x> you can totally use curl with HTTPS
01:20 < christo_m> xer0x: hmm.. i dont see an option in the manual
01:20 < christo_m> it keeps defaulting to 80
01:20 < xer0x> curl -vk https://lol.api/whatever
01:21 < xer0x> christo_m: anyways, that Node client doesn't look finished. It doesn't look like it sends the user/pass to the API
01:22 < xer0x> christo_m: er.. it does at the .end
01:24 < christo_m> xer0x: curl didnt show anything interesting there.
01:24 < MI6> joyent/node: Nirk Niggler master * 0459a23 : REPL: fix floating point number parsing  In JS, the expression ".1" is a  - http://git.io/jLbVQQ
01:24 < TooTallNate> niggler: ^
01:25 < christo_m> xer0x: a call is made to connect at the end, which looks like it sets up all the RTMP stuff
01:25 < niggler> ++ TooTallNate sorry about that -- i use the repl a lot to test stuff, so those minor niggles are irritating
01:25 < TooTallNate> niggles
01:25 < TooTallNate> lol
01:25 < christo_m> i turned the debugging option on and stepped through it
01:26 < christo_m> RTMP login fails. not very illuminating
01:26 < jrajav> Is your surname actually niggler?
01:28 < niggler> an exercise in legal trolling
01:30 < niggler> gotta love the USA
01:31 < niggler> it's not my original given name, if that's what you are asking
01:31 < jcrew> fwiw i laughed when i first read it
01:32 < niggler> its actually a really strange story
01:37 < chovy> let's hear it
01:39 < niggler> not even 15 minutes after the name was created, i was already called out for having a fake name
01:39 < jcrew> i thought you were typing the epic
01:40 < niggler> it started as an exploration of the financial industry
01:40 < niggler> so my main business is proprietary trading
01:40 < niggler> ( TooTallNate its my business hence there's no concern about employer claim to code )
01:41 < niggler> and i found myself in a really strange position where I had a position in a stock
01:41 < niggler> and there was a buyout offer the next day, so that position doubled
01:42 < niggler> now the only reason i was there was because i have a process which calculates which stocks are best for market making (cronjob runs at 4 am)
01:42 < niggler> so this having happened, i was interested in what was going on with the company etc.  and at the time, 90% of the articles on google finance and google news came from a website called seeking alpha
01:42 < jcrew> this sounds like something i did when i was in the marine corps
01:43 < niggler> a startup that's trying to get into the financial news industry
01:43 < niggler> anyway, so i started this to figure out what's going on
01:43 < niggler> i wrote something and had them do their magic
01:43 < niggler> then it showed up on google finance!
01:44 < niggler> but it gets worse
01:44 < niggler> im trying to find the screenshot one sec
01:45 < niggler> here we go: http://cl.ly/image/2T0w2v0I2q0Q
01:45 < niggler> the original tweet address https://twitter.com/adamfeuerstein/status/224851208190439424
01:46 < niggler> and this happened literally 15 minutes after i put this all together
01:47 < niggler> so then i had to go through a verification process, and naturally i solved it by adopting the name
01:47 < mdedetrich> hey peeps
01:48 < niggler> in retrospect i probably shouldn't have, but i learned a ton about legal persons, names, etc
01:48 < niggler> so here i am :)
01:48 < niggler> hey mdedetrich
01:48 < jcrew> had to go through verification on seekingalpha?
01:48 < jcrew> i'm reading your article
01:49 < niggler> well it started there
01:49 < niggler> oh the article was censored after the fact
01:49 < niggler> which makes the story even more strange
01:49 < jcrew> i wrote something in 2005 to look for large splits i could exploit
01:49 < niggler> im looking for different things
01:49 < niggler> its rebate capture
01:50 < niggler> so the exchanges pay out a rebate to liquidity providers
01:50 < niggler> (that concept was developed during decimalization, but the rebates were set too high)
01:51 < niggler> that rebate usually exceeds the costs of the trade (and is supposed to compensate for risk)
01:51 < niggler> so you see some very large funds that run a big martingale -- if you have enough capital, you can just sit on positions and wait for them to move in your favor)
01:52 < niggler> the dumb martingale pays out .1 cent per share after costs for small-price stocks (sub-20 dollars)
01:52 < jcrew> so are you just investing in the liquidity providers?
01:53 < jcrew> it's like superman 3
01:54 < niggler> what happened over the past 8-10 years is really funny -- the exchanges decided to promote this model because they knew they could charge exorbitant colocation fees, but now since volumes are dropping the exchanges are getting slaughtered
01:54 < niggler> NYSE was recently bought out by ICE and, if you read the press releases, the purchase was mostly symbolic
01:54 < jcrew> they didn't change any of the trading rules?
01:55 < niggler> its a much larger discussion, but nyse was slow to the rebate game
01:55 < niggler> the idea is that you can either cater to those who provide liquidity or to those who take liquidity (these are the 'real traders' that CNBC talks about)
01:56 < niggler> for various reasons, over the past 3 years, even though the S&P doubled people aren't participating as much
01:56 < niggler> based on what I've seen, I think that the industry is basically squeezing pennies from pension funds, retirement funds, and wealth management.
01:57 < niggler> and the first two categories are seeing a major crunch, the former thanks to regulatory changes and the PBGC and the latter thanks to the economy (people using their retirement savings to last until social security starts paying)
01:57 < jcrew> stuff like enron and madoff didn't really help people's view of that stuff
01:57 < othiym23> welp, that was a fun foray into #haskell
01:58 < othiym23> note to self: mentioning llvm.js in #haskell not a super good idea
01:58 < niggler> then you have stuff like the flash crash in 2010
01:58 < niggler> the markets themselves have become more fragile
01:59 < niggler> $50K, for example, is enough to cause a half-percent swing in some stocks like AA (alcoa, a dow component)
02:00 < niggler> i gotta say, though, i've been losing interest in programming over the past few years but node and js really piqued my interests
02:00 < owen1> is it possible to deploy to multiple hosts using https://github.com/visionmedia/deploy
02:00 < owen1> ?
02:01 < jcrew> i haven't really been a developer for like 10 years, node is fun though
02:02 < niggler> TooTallNate what are your thoughts on having node Buffer support length-prefixed strings?
02:07 < draginx> does anyone in here know how to check for float numbers in jasmine/frisby?
02:15 < TooTallNate> niggler: user-land
02:16 < TooTallNate> niggler: and in fact, look up "netstrings"
02:16 < othiym23> draginx: number % 1 !== 0
02:18 < samholmes> I'm not sure whether these dump.rdb files are coming from mac or from redis
02:18 < niggler> samholmes redis
02:19 < samholmes> I see
02:19 < niggler> that's saving to disk
02:19 < samholmes> So it just dumps the file in the working dir were the redis-server command was invoked?
02:20 < niggler> there may be a configuration option for that
02:21 < niggler> its the 'dir' option samholmes in redis.conf
02:22 < samholmes> Where is the default redis.conf located?
02:26 < draginx> othiym23: thanks now im trying to figure out how to properly make an extension to the matchers
02:33 < astropirate> test
02:38 < jcrew> /test
02:39 < draginx> Is there a way to send an image with frisbyjs/jasmine?
02:50 < niggler> OT: anyone familiar with content MathML?
03:02 < owen1> is it possible to deploy to multiple hosts using https://github.com/visionmedia/deploy?
03:43 < christo_m> xer0x: im completely lost 
03:44 < xer0x> christo_m: how's LoL going?
03:44 < christo_m> xer0x: i emailed the guy who developed the client, i mean, the last commit was like 7 months ago so maybe something changed in the authentication process
03:44 < christo_m> not well
03:44 < xer0x> christo_m: ya, they've probably added something extra
03:44 < xer0x> christo_m: have you looked at adobe's site for RTMP authentication documentation?
03:45 < christo_m> xer0x: it looks like all there is is the RFC standards for the protocol
03:45 < christo_m> i dont know if i have to get that low level, but may be
03:45 < christo_m> xer0x: http://www.adobe.com/devnet/rtmp.html
03:47 < xer0x> I don't think they're using RTMP
03:47 < christo_m> xer0x: https://code.google.com/p/lolrtmpsclient/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fcom%2Fgvaneyck%2Frtmp  Got this to work though
03:48 < christo_m> xer0x: it loosk like the Adobe Air client does exactly that, rtmp , actionscript , etc 
03:49 < xer0x> christo_m: yep
03:49 < xer0x> christo_m: whoa, that java client has a lot going on
03:50 < christo_m> xer0x: right? i dont want to parse all that ish!
03:50 < christo_m> That guy went the extra mile and wrote a package in there to spectate any player, based on handle alone
04:04 < christo_m> xer0x: even the node-amf libs claim to be unstable due to how horrid adobes specs are.
04:05 < christo_m> they obviously did this on purpose to troll us all
04:06 < xer0x> true that.
04:11 < joe-node0> I'm looking for a JavaScript programmer for a really cool web application, in fact I'll even pay you $20!
04:11 < joe-node0> this is a joke btw
04:11 < mmalecki> let's not spoil programmers, would we?
04:12 < mmalecki> $ 20 is waaaay too much
04:12 < sente> heh, reminds me of
04:12 < sente> https://twitter.com/JesseWaites/status/278281842648563714
04:12 < joe-node0> this guy comes into the YUI room a month ago and tries to petition people to "Write a datatable module" for him
04:12 < sente> "I need a Rails guy for a super super interesting project- a few hours tops. Anti-corporate espionage type of thing."
04:12 < joe-node0> "it'll only take you 25 mins!" 
04:13 < joe-node0> then he says... "Cmon I'll pay you like $25 bucks!"
04:13 < sente> my response was incredulous with sarcasm
04:13 < sente> but he thought i was serious
04:13 < joe-node0> no he was
04:13 < joe-node0> that's what made it hilarious
04:13 < joe-node0> I told him it would take a good YUI programmer at least 3 weeks, and that he should just give up now.
04:13 < mmalecki> people are hilarious sometimes

04:15 < mmalecki> buzzword limit reached
04:16  * mscdex shakes a fist at IMAP
04:16 < joe-node0> if only robots could program
04:16 < Sembiance> AlchemyFalcon: rofl, that almost hit ALL the buzz words ;)
04:16 < mmalecki> mscdex: yeah, it's terrible
04:16 < AlchemyFalcon> haha :)
04:16 < niggler> what are the other 2012 buzzwords that AlchemyFalcon missed Sembiance?
04:16 < mscdex> mmalecki: you're being too polite
04:16 < sashman> looool at joe-node0
04:17 < joe-node0> we need more robots dammit!
04:17 < mmalecki> why can't we get an actual protocol for email
04:17 < niggler> mscdex are you dealing with courier-imap?
04:17 < niggler> or just the protocol
04:17 < mscdex> niggler: imap the protocol :-\
04:17 < sente> if you guys ever need twitter [ro]bots, let me know
04:17 < niggler> because i daresay that the software is worse than the protocol
04:17 < sente> somehow i end up making a new one every other day it seems
04:17 < mmalecki> mscdex: I implemented it in python tornado a while back
04:17 < mscdex> imap is so bad in so many ways
04:18 < mmalecki> that was the worst week of my life
04:18 < niggler> parsing XLS is far worse
04:18 < mscdex> it wouldn't be so bad if fetch responses weren't such a pain
04:19 < mmalecki> I'd pay for IMAP -> REST
04:19  * joe-node0 off to get sugar for final work-burst of the day
04:19 < mscdex> heh
04:19 < mscdex> niggler: i've parsed binary office document metadata before :-)
04:20 < mmalecki> who wants to make one for $ 25?
04:20 < niggler> nooo not the metadata mscdex
04:20 < niggler> *very basic* http://niggler.github.com/js-xls/
04:20 < niggler> and by very basic i mean it was used to parse stuff that were generated from the output of a machine that generated xls
04:21 < niggler> i kinda wish the machine generated csv
04:21 < mmalecki> I'd write one if I could come up with some business model behind it
04:21 < mscdex> yeah, i had started to do that but i never got to parsing the streams
04:21 < mmalecki> otherwise it's not worth the money spent on valium
04:21 < niggler> mmalecki you can write it and pay yourself 25 bucks
04:22 < mmalecki> niggler: how do I tax myself paying myself?
04:22 < niggler> its less than 600 bucks -> disappears into the void
04:22 < mscdex> niggler: fwiw here's what little i had: https://github.com/mscdex/documation
04:23 < mscdex> after awhile i thought it's not worth it with binary dying off and xml docs being the "future" ...
04:23 < mscdex> :S
04:23 < niggler> i tried excel web app and excel 2013
04:23 < niggler> both represent major steps back
04:23 < niggler> its as if they took cues from apple
04:24 < niggler> *apple 'numbers'
04:24 < niggler> mscdex you didnt try hard enough: https://github.com/Niggler/js-xls/blob/master/xlsconsts.js
04:25 < mscdex> niggler: i know, as i said i just got to parsing the metadata ;-)
04:25 < mscdex> the OLE crap
04:25 < niggler> anyone have a framework for distributed math with JS?
04:26 < niggler> ive been playing with a simple monte carlo simulation framework but it seems like something someone has done already
04:29 < styol> Node standard is two space indentation, correct?
04:29 < mbalho> yep
04:29 < styol> gracias
04:32 < styol> damn, the terminology for that is escaping me.. was it "standards" or something else? "coding standards"?
04:33 < niggler> style
04:33 < mbalho> styol: http://nodeguide.com/style.html
04:33 < styol> ah sweet, thanks niggler and mbalho
04:34 < mbalho> styol: actually i think this is more up to date https://github.com/felixge/node-style-guide
04:36 < styol>  oh whoa, I thought multiple variable declarations per var statement was standard.. perhaps have just seen it pretty often and assumed
04:37 < SomeoneWeird> pretty sure it is
04:37 < SomeoneWeird> oh, heh
04:37 < SomeoneWeird> most people do it anyway
04:38 < styol> yeah dats what me thought me has seen commonly
04:38 < mbalho> styol: style guides are always a bike shed. i like a new var on each line because it makes it easier to copy paste lines around
04:38 < styol> mbalho: yeah i understand. I still do that but it is usually within the same list haha
04:39 < styol> multi-line ternary operators makes me sad face… that was like on of the main reasons i decided to start using ternary operators was to keep simple checks on a single line heh
04:40  * styol cheers for acquired OCD
04:40 < niggler> i used to like ternary operators, then i met php devs
04:40 < joe-node0> I just say "screw it" and use the semantically obvious "if, else if"
04:41 < niggler> why did php have to break ternary operator :/
04:42 < joe-node0> why did php have to execute a script and then quit?
04:43 < joe-node0> PHP's answer to memory management is "run it once then kill it"
04:43 < styol> Fatal error: Out of memory (allocated 32016932123874) (tried to allocate 18746 bytes)
04:43 < joe-node0> I know, I hate that
04:44 < RLa> why you still use php, that's biggest failure
04:44 < joe-node0> I don't
04:44 < joe-node0> I use Node.js for things I do server-side
04:44 < niggler> >>> 'a' ? 'b' ? 'c' : 'd' : 'e' ? 'f' : 'g'
04:44 < purr> niggler: (string) 'c'
04:44 < niggler> $ php -r "echo 'a' ? 'b' ? 'c' : 'd' : 'e' ? 'f' : 'g';" --> f
04:45 < joe-node0> I don't care how compact that is I'll never write code so obscure.
04:46 < joe-node0> I mean I like short and sweet code too, but I like me semantics spelled out in the open.
04:46 < styol> yeah, i usually keep it to simple if/else personally.. after 2 or 3 layers you definitely start to go wtf
04:47 < styol> something about var foo; if (bar) { foo = true; } else { foo = false; } flares up the OCD gnomes versus var foo = (bar) ? true : false;
04:47  * joe-node0 suspects that obscure code usages are a cheap trick used by some programmers as a way to lock management into needing their services.
04:47 < niggler> define "obscure code"
04:48 < niggler> a lot of strange idioms look obscure until you start using it :)
04:48 < joe-node0> I don't have to, a wonderful example is: $ php -r "echo 'a' ? 'b' ? 'c' : 'd' : 'e' ? 'f' : 'g';" --> f
04:48 < joe-node0> nope, I'm a clarity nazi
04:49 < joe-node0> IDE's are for convenience, and comments are for when you come back to code you can't even remember the purpose of... :-)
04:49 < joe-node0> happens quite a bit
04:49 < joe-node0> something works, then people use it forever, and then one day something breaks.
04:50 < joe-node0> so I comment things for my own benefit later on.
04:51  * joe-node0 is a business type turned coder
04:51 < joe-node0> so that makes me biased 
04:54 < niggler> what does "business type turned coder" mean?
04:54 < RLa> mba doing coding?
04:55 < RLa> tho i have seen opposite a lot more, a coder doing business
04:56 < niggler> mba != business type
04:56 < joe-node0> as in I used to spec and manage projects then one day a programmer went awol on a project and I knew just enough JS to be able to jump in and pick up where he left off
04:57 < niggler> ohh like milton!
04:57 < joe-node0> milton?
04:57 < niggler> lol office space
04:57 < joe-node0> Um, no
04:58 < joe-node0> I didn't get sent to the basement
04:58 < joe-node0> though I have referred to my office as the "code dungeon"
04:58 < joe-node0> so yeah, comments are my friends, that and nice clear semantically obvious code
04:59 < niggler> do you comment every like, like "x = x + 1; /* increment x.  for example, if x was 3 before the statement, it will be 4 afterwards */"
05:02 < joe-node0> let's say I have this...
05:02 < joe-node0> http://pastie.org/5619735
05:02 < joe-node0> I comment like that
05:02 < RLa> too deep nesting
05:02 < joe-node0> otherwise it's an exercise in pain and frustration to figure out just what the hell is happenning.
05:03 < RLa> yeah, with that nesting and word wrapping ...
05:03 < ashnur> i am starting to hate promises
05:03 < joe-node0> well the word wrap is just pastie being... pastie
05:03 < ashnur> it's like just another buzzword
05:04  * joe-node0 doesn't like promises, prefers contracts ;-)
05:04 < niggler> blargh way too many comments
05:04 < niggler> my eyes are bleeding
05:04 < ashnur> joe-node0: contracts?
05:04 < joe-node0> ashnur: it's a joke, ;-)
05:04 < ashnur> ah. i was just about to ask it :)
05:05 < ashnur> i can't do something nicely with them
05:05 < RLa> ashnur, callbacks won't do?
05:06 < ashnur> RLa: promises use callbacks to. it's not  about what will do, because everything will do it, if you write it. it's about the fact that I don't like any of the options because some things are frikin ugly to do with them
05:06 < ashnur> too*
05:06 < ashnur> it's just abstracted away, so that it is hard to understand
05:07 < ashnur> took me days :((
05:08 < joe-node0> Here we go, all the pastie code mangling is cleaned up: http://pastie.org/5619752
05:09 < joe-node0> same nesting but now it's nice and concise with no word-wrap.
05:09 < mscdex> plain callbacks ftw!
05:10 < RLa> joe-node0, instead of using modelAttributes[modelAttr] everywhere, extract it into a single variable
05:10 < joe-node0> is it wordy, yeah a bit. But I know when I come back to it in a month and have been doing a million other things, I can pick it up again easily.
05:11 < joe-node0> RLa: you get "talked to" in certain rooms for "redundant variables" if you do that. 
05:11 < joe-node0> lol
05:12 < draginx> Is there a way to send an image with frisbyjs/jasmine?
05:12 < SomeoneWeird> joe-node0, then they're stupid
05:12 < RLa> joe-node0, for that case, i doubt
05:12 < joe-node0> maybe, but I didn't write that code, I just had to make it work and maintain it.
05:13 < ryan12> Hmm
05:13 < joe-node0> the dude that did, took off, was a PHP coder that didn't take kindly to JS
05:13 < RLa> joe-node0, instead of that big-ass switch, use object like { 'aud_wrd_cnt': 'Audio Word Count: ', 'aud_src_length_mins': '...' }
05:13 < RLa> this makes it much more concise
05:14 < RLa> oh, and use quotes consistently, currently is looks like mix of ' and "
05:14 < joe-node0> RLa: I prefer ' but it's an old habit from learning some Java, "" is for strings and '' is for chars.
05:15 < joe-node0> I'm trying to transition to only ''
05:15 < RLa> that's good
05:17 < joe-node0> so I'm like 3 months into JS and I have to deal with this app that has 3 widgets all communicating via events through a Y.view 'controller' of sorts
05:17 < joe-node0> all the widgets have modellists full of models
05:17 < joe-node0> yeah, that's a deep pool to have been thrown into
05:17 < RLa> if the app will live for more time, it's usually worth refactoring
05:18 < joe-node0> RLa: I refactor all the time, and when I learn more about how to use Y.view properly with handlebars I'll probably do just that
05:18 < RLa> good
05:19 < joe-node0> It's just a nightmare because it's not enough to know YUI 3 and MVC-ish JS development, this app sits inside of a Joomla component which is all PHP, a language I do not have much experience in.
05:20 < joe-node0> so all the server-side stuff is supposed to be in PHP and I'm just hating the fact that I can't use Nodejs for that (it would fight with apache for http traffic so that's bad)
05:21 < RLa> how big the app is?
05:21 < joe-node0> 5000 lines just for the quotation part of it.
05:21 < joe-node0> client-side quotation generator
05:22 < RLa> does it have multiple front-ends, for web and mobile?
05:22 < joe-node0> I'd like to use nodejs on some other port and funnel the ajax traffic through that but I don't think that will work.
05:22 < joe-node0> correction, I don't know how to do that... yet.
05:22 < RLa> well, we use nodejs here with apache
05:23 < joe-node0> RLa: proxy?
05:23 < RLa> through mod_proxy, it works for normal ajax stuff but i have no idea for websockets
05:23 < RLa> and we use apache only because of php
05:23 < joe-node0> I might just get a separate domain and proxy all traffic through it to nodejs, but that's just so wrong.
05:24 < RLa> can't switch to nginx too because of stupid rewrite rules
05:24 < joe-node0> websockets might be the best way to keep apache and just use another port
05:24 < RLa> with separate domain, watch for cross-domain security issues
05:25 < joe-node0> I know it's a pain in the ass
05:25 < joe-node0> damn pre-existing infrastructure...
05:32 < draginx> Any idea why frisbyjs would work but not superagent..? superagent just hangs my request as opposed to frisby
05:43 < Bergle_1> Anyone ever hit a case where   async  fs.stat(path, cb) isnt doing the cb() call back, but fs.statSync(path) returns fine. 
05:43 < jcrew> joe-node0: it's been my experience apache will proxy socket.io but it falls back to xhr polling
05:49 < jcrew> so, if you're only looking for XHR - it works with the reverse proxy on apache : )
06:00 < dileep> hello noders
06:01 < dileep> hey i need image uplaoder option using uuid,any kind of module or repositry
06:24 < ryan12> ¥£€
06:41 < mistertwig> i've got a question about async.js
06:41 < mistertwig> when i'm using series, is there a way to pass something from the previous callback to the next?
06:41 < SomeoneWeird> don't ask to ask :)
06:41 < SomeoneWeird> you want .waterfall
06:42 < SomeoneWeird> instead of series
06:42 < wookiehangover> can you rephrase that as an ethical question?
06:42 < mistertwig> ahh SomeoneWeird
06:42 < mistertwig> that's exactly what i need
06:42 < mistertwig> thanks lol
06:42 < owen1> is there a common path on debian/ubuntu to use for the web apps?
06:42 < SomeoneWeird> :) np
06:42 < mistertwig> /var/www :P
06:42 < owen1> mistertwig: why the smily?
06:42 < mistertwig> owen1: why not
06:43 < owen1> mistertwig: just making sure u'r serious
06:43 < owen1> thanks
06:43 < mistertwig> oh well i don't know 
06:43 < mistertwig> it's used for apache 
06:44 < mistertwig> so SomeoneWeird
06:44 < mistertwig> in the example they show
06:44 < mistertwig>     function(arg1, arg2, callback){
06:44 < mistertwig> hmm wait
06:44 < mistertwig> i think i got it
06:44 < mistertwig> i'll test it out first
07:15 < dileep> i am unable to install formidable,getting error unable to locatte package,anybody here for help
07:33 < moszeed> quick question: if i build a REST Client in node, would the "same-origin" policiy affected ??
07:36 <@konobi> it's not a browser
07:38 < moszeed> but it`s javascript. ok no policiy. that`s cool ..
07:40 <@konobi> javascript and same-origin aren't exactly related... you have same-origin issues with actionscript and vbs too
08:33 < bradleymeck> isaacs: any idea for a cross platform way to alter execPath when executing node?
08:35 < bradleymeck> the patch test case for fork fails hard on windows if running through a separate process so going through node itself is the only sane way… but that means having same execPath (unless using links, which on windows is confusing / make is not happy with hard linking idea after compile)

08:41 -!- halfblood was kicked from #Node.js by konobi [halfblood]
08:42 < mbalho> that was a pretty good run
08:42 -!- mode/#Node.js [+o mbalho] by ChanServ
08:45 <@konobi> bradleymeck: change it? how so?
08:46 < bradleymeck> konobi, just make process.spawn have a guaranteed different value than if invoked via `node` / via the node in the core repository's root
08:46 < bradleymeck> symlinks don't really make for fun if you have to do it on both OS
08:46 <@konobi> XY
08:47 <@konobi> bradleymeck: just looking for a way to differentiate the parent from the child?
08:47 < bradleymeck> based on execPath yes
08:48 <@konobi> env var not sufficient?
08:48 < bradleymeck> konobi no, it doesn't properly test the problem
08:49 <@konobi> bradleymeck: again... xy
08:49 <@konobi> =0)
08:50 < bradleymeck> xy?
08:50 <@konobi> see the topic
08:51 < bradleymeck> konobi, I have a patch for .fork adding .execPath to the options, izs wants a test case added for this before pulling it in
08:52 < bradleymeck> needs to work on all OS
08:52 < bradleymeck> so I need to test that the child has 1. the new execPath 2. that the ipc is working
08:52 <@konobi> why the new execPath?
08:52 < bradleymeck> konobi cause thats what the patch adds
08:53 <@konobi> but why?
08:53 < bradleymeck> konobi what else would you test for if your execPath was set by the parent?
08:53 < bradleymeck> setting an env is misleading and I faced a gotcha with already in this
08:54 <@konobi> if it's a fork, i'd assume that it's a readonly variable that's shared from the parents memory space and therefore shouldn't be altered
08:54 < bradleymeck> konobi it does not us c's fork to do the .fork due to windows, no shared exec space, its actually spawning a new child
08:55 < bradleymeck> the misnomer has been brought up many a time
08:55 <@konobi> yes
08:56 <@konobi> can testing for the existance of process.send isn't sufficient either i suppose... hhhmmm...
08:57 < chrisevans1001> Guys can you see any flaws with this: Communications + Game servers (seperate Node.js instances). Communications link together via tcp and each communications server connects to game server. When a client joins they go to primary communications server which authorises them then passes back the ip of the communications server with the least load. They reconnect to that server which then sends relevant communications
08:57 < chrisevans1001>  to the game server. Is there a better way? I felt this was relatively scalable.
08:57 <@konobi> bradleymeck: so you're doing multiple levels of spawn ?
08:58 < bradleymeck> konobi in the patter of the test/simple/test-child-process-fork-* yes
08:58 < bradleymeck> pattern*
08:58 < chrisevans1001> (to clarify communications handles tcp connections from client, links to facebook, twitter etc - game server handles individual games (of 6 players) and relevant logic)
08:58 <@konobi> oh, fun fun
08:58 <@konobi> chrisevans1001: handle your load balancing at the incoming tcp level
08:59 < chrisevans1001> good idea. im using aws and load balancer supports tcp now i believe
09:00 <@konobi> or any actual load balancer, stud, haproxy, etc.
09:01 < chrisevans1001> just looked that up, thanks :)
09:24 < imm> hi
09:44 < mchammer> hi
09:44 < imm> hello
09:48 < QwerT> only me?
09:49 < mchammer> i need some help storing a huge amount of objects. i am building an isometric game and got 1.024×10¹³ tiles to save for map-creation and load on server-start. wat would be a good way to do this? is it possible at all to cache such a huge map in node.js while the server is running?
09:49 < mchammer> each tile contains some strings and numbers
09:52 < mchammer> right now i just save/load each tile as an object to/from mongodb which already takes some time on a  very small map of 204800 tiles
09:52 < mchammer> should i store it into a file maybe?
09:59 < jonaslund> arghhhhhhhhh
09:59 < jonaslund> real world code
09:59 < jonaslund> rhino is 200x slower than v8
09:59 < guor> doh. it's a vm on top of a vm
09:59 < jonaslund> partially
10:00 < jonaslund> the worst part is that they tried too hard to "integrate" with java code instead of focusing on keeping it fast and making the integration painful/slow
10:01 < jonaslund> I don't have any numbers for the new jvm/js from oracle but if you'd make a separate object stack and eliminate most type detection by double dispatching i think they could get within 10x slower of v8
10:02 < Doikor> i still dont understand how its performance is so bad when compared to other jvm languages.
10:04 < Doikor> even when comparing to other dynamic languages running on jvm (groovy)
10:05 < Doikor> did they actually implement a real vm on top of the already existing vm from jvm?
10:05 < jonaslund> Doikor: i think that it was designed correctness and for java integration and not speed from day one
10:05 < Doikor> why not just use the one provided by jvm :/
10:05 < Guest20916> One question I always have because I never used node for production level but stopped it at poc is cluster
10:05 < Doikor> jonaslund: ok that makes sense.
10:06 < Guest20916> Anyone used cluster module in production?
10:06 < jonaslund> Doikor: that said, the internals are butt ugly and i think rewriting it from almost scratch would've done them good
10:07 < jonaslund> Doikor: gonna be interesting to see where nashorn goes
10:12 < Doikor> nice that they seem to be porting node APIs into nashorn in the Node.jar project.
10:13 < Doikor> though dont know if they will ever release the source for that part
10:15 < jonaslund> i think they will
10:15 < jonaslund> (assuming it doesn't perform like a dog :) )
10:31 < Sonderblade> when you use websockets (or socket.io or equivalent) do you usually let all server-client communication go via the socket or some of it using plain old ajax?
10:38 < lpin> Sonderblade depends, i have an app that use both ws and ajax
10:38 < lpin> ajax when ws is not needed
10:39 < lpin> it's up to you thou
10:49 < drim> I have a list of issues store in a object (object.issues). I want to display it by user (user XXXX: issue1, issue2 etc). Should I store its by user or should I do a filter or something like this after ?
11:21 < simong> Does anyone know a good (non-GPL-licensed) lib/tool that allows you to convert office files to pdf ?
11:21 < simong> jodconverter seems to be erroring out for some reason
11:24 < Bergle_1> simong - not sure if this suits, but i uplaod files to gmail and download as pdf - not sure how automatable that is.
11:24 < Bergle_1> i mean to drive there docs area.
11:25 < simong> I don't think that'll work for us
11:29 < nathan7> simong: You can automate libreoffice
11:29 < nathan7> simong: but the last time I did that it was still called OpenOffice
11:30 < stride> that'd be the same thing I guess
11:30 < stride> isn't jodconverter still just wrapping openoffice?
11:30 < simong> I think so, the jodconverter uses the UNO interface that soffice exposes
11:30 < simong> I can give it a try with libreoffice I suppose
11:31 < SomeoneWeird> Anyone know why I might be getting "Inappropriate ioctl for device" when trying to write to stdin of a spawned process?
11:50 < nathan7> SomeoneWeird: o.O
11:50 < nathan7> SomeoneWeird: How'd you manage that?
11:51 < SomeoneWeird> absolutely no idea
12:03 < Bergle_1> anyone around that is familiear with mkdirp that might tell me what im dong wrong http://posh.jaykul.com/p/5622  -  it appears that in this case mkdirp() is not actually running the callback
12:11 < RLa> Bergle_1, it does not create the directory?
12:15 < Chel_> question: is there a way to see javascript V8 built in object interfaces not in internet ?
12:15 < Chel_> any local help files or builtin manual ?
12:26 < stiang> I am switching to using generic-pool (node-pool) for handling mysql connections in my web app. Should I acquire and release a connection for each query in a web request, or once per request for all queries?
13:42 < [Gixx]> hello
13:44 < [Gixx]> can you help me with socket.io and Express or I should go to a different room?
13:45 < balboah> if you ask the real question first you don't have to have two questions answered. should be twice the probability to get an answer ;)
13:45 < balboah> now I already answered the first and won't answer the second
13:47 < [Gixx]> Ok :) So, I'm new to node.js, but I have to do some support chat thing. I've created a very simple version which works well, so I want to "Level Up" it. I started with this tutorial: http://www.danielbaulig.de/socket-ioexpress/
13:48 < [Gixx]> After debugging and fixing it works.. But I don't really understand, what-where-when sets the express.sid
13:48 < [Gixx]> And while there's no such cookie, every connection attempt will fail
13:49 < [Gixx]> I found this kind of "is.set('authorization')..." thing in several blogs, but any of them explains me where-when-how to set the cookie
13:50 < [Gixx]> * ..io.set...
13:51 < [Gixx]> So my question is: Can you help me understand this somehow?
13:53 < [Gixx]> the clients should generate a sessionId and set to cookie (no sense) or the server creates it, but auth will drop the connection before it can do anything

15:13 < Exx2xxO> Hello =)
15:14 < Exx2xxO> I've got a problem. Does anyone of you know how to use Node.js without installation? On Mac and Windows. So it starts up and runs a specific .js ?
15:15 < damaru> hi
15:16 < damaru> I am totally confused, I updated node trough the apt-get install on debian wheezy and not I cannot start node, on the cli
15:16 < damaru> if I do a sudo node it does work though
15:17 < damaru> it also affect yeoman package that I installed trough the npm
15:18 < niggler> Exx2xxO does a  VM work?
15:18 < alex88> hi guys, I've the var db inside the app.js, how can I get the var inside the routes function to use the db?
15:20 < damaru> 
15:56 < draginx> is there a way to update just global NPMs?
15:59 < SomeoneWeird> draginx, cd to / and npm update -g ? i dunno
15:59 < draginx> would be neat to have an official way of doing it O_o

16:41 < Exx2xxO> hey people ! Me again :D Got a short simple question: Das anybode know how to check if node.js is running? So when somebody browses to a specific url (which is a website on a webserver) and this person doesn't run node.js can I check that ?
16:41 < Exx2xxO> With php
16:41 < bnoordhuis> Exx2xxO: sorry, but... wut?
16:41 < geNAZt> bo you cant
16:42 < geNAZt> no*
16:42 < sohcahtoa> I'm trying to parse this questionb
16:42 < geNAZt> he want to know if a server runs php or nodejs
16:42 < sohcahtoa> I'm stuck at Das
16:42 < geNAZt> but the server doesnt tell you that
16:42 < keithMiklas_> if it's fast it's running node ;)
16:42 < geNAZt> looool
16:43 < sohcahtoa> I am not sure that is what he is asking at all
16:43 < Exx2xxO> okay stop :D
16:43 < Exx2xxO> my english is bad I'll give it a new try
16:43 < geNAZt> from where are you ?
16:43 < Exx2xxO> germany
16:44 < geNAZt> ja dann sags mir in deutsch
16:44 < geNAZt> :D
16:44 < sohcahtoa> deutschland uber alles
16:44 < Exx2xxO> oh okay das ist praktisch xD
16:45 < Exx2xxO> Folgendes: Ich will überprüfen ob ein Benutzer der auf meine Webseite kommt auf seinem PC node.js am laufen hat (also irgendwie...krieg ich das heut mit dem formulieren net hin)
16:45 < geNAZt> hat der benutzer einen port nach aussen offen ?
16:45 < geNAZt> wenn ja kann du nodejs dran binden und diesen port dann mit localhost abfragen
16:47 < geNAZt> aber generell ohne extra software auf dem client wird das nicht gehen
16:47 < Exx2xxO> Müsste es nicht theoretisch mit php und ner simplen abfrage auf die nur node.js antwortet klappen?
16:48 < geNAZt> es gibt keine anfragen auf die nur nodejs antwortet
16:48 < geNAZt> ich kann z.b. nodejs laufen haben ohne das es von aussen irgendwas annimmt
16:49 < Exx2xxO> Ja das schon aber ich entwickle ja auch ne node.js applikation die ja von aussen was annehmen soll
16:49 < Exx2xxO> und nur wenn die läuft soll meine webseite darauf reagieren
16:49 < geNAZt> ja aber wozu mussst du dann wissen, das der client auch nodejs hat
16:49 < geNAZt> achso
16:49 < geNAZt> ne desktop applikcation
16:49 < Exx2xxO> mehr oder minder
16:50 < geNAZt> ja dann binde in der app einfach einen port
16:50 < geNAZt> und ruf den per javascript deiner webseite auf
16:50 < geNAZt> mit ajax
16:50 < geNAZt> oder sowas
16:50 < Exx2xxO> okay.. das geht serverseitig :D?
16:51 < geNAZt> du brauchst den client dazwischen
16:51 < geNAZt> webseite => app => webseite => server
16:51 < geNAZt> so in der art
16:51 < Exx2xxO> aso
16:52 < Exx2xxO> man ich hasse web entwicklung... da lobe ich doch die gute alte Softwareentwicklung ^^ Da versteht man wenigstens was man tut  :D
16:52 < geNAZt> does someone know a doctrine like orm in nodejs ?
16:52 < geNAZt> ja du musst halt um die sicherheit drumherum
16:53 < geNAZt> und du kommst vom server halt nicht auf den client :D das ist auch gut so
16:53 < Exx2xxO> Das muss ich auch nicht ^^ Reicht auch wenn der Client ne Nachricht sendet auf die der Server dann reagiert :D
16:54 < Exx2xxO> Na gut danke dir werde mich mal schlau machen und dich wieder stören, wenn ich weitere Probleme hab :P

17:13 < jcrew> also for line ten you don't want an array of pointers
17:15 < cellvia> what is a linklist
17:15 < cellvia> https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/_linklist.js
17:16 < jcrew> cellvia: it's a list of data structures that reference the next (and sometimes previous) item in the chain
17:17 < jcrew> not like a hash table or array, though some hash tables implement some form of linked list
17:18 < BlissOfBeing> How can i go about adding two objects on the same key? i.e.  {12: {name: 'bliss'}} + {12: {name: 'abe'}, 13: {name: 'being'}} = {12: {name: bliss, name: abe}, 13:{name: 'abe'}}
17:18 < abe> don't talk about me like that.
17:18 < BlissOfBeing> ha, sorry
17:19 < geNAZt> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/171251/how-can-i-merge-properties-of-two-javascript-objects-dynamically
17:19 < cellvia> jcrew, interesting, what are the traditional uses of this?
17:19 < stagas> BlissOfBeing: no you can't have two properties named 'name' there
17:19 < cellvia> is abe a bot
17:19 < jcrew> cellvia: i used them quite a bit in C when i had an unknown array size or i wanted a list of 'struct's
17:20 < abe> cellvia: no.
17:20 < cellvia> would a bot admit that he was a bot?
17:20 < tjfontaine> cellvia: in js you would likely use them when you don't know (or expect a large amount) of objects and you only need to iterate them
17:20 < cellvia> tjfontaine could you explain further?
17:20 < tjfontaine> cellvia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list
17:20 < valterguy> cellvia: depends on how it's programmed to react.
17:21 < valterguy> cellvia: it could deny it. we would never know.
17:21 < jcrew> i'm not sure why you'd use them in js with how flexible arrays are
17:21 < cellvia> im just curious because im seeing it in node core but ive never seen it used anywhere
17:22 < niggler> arrays are nasty
17:22 < cellvia> "The principal benefit of a linked list over a conventional array is that the list elements can easily be inserted or removed without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure because the data items need not be stored contiguously in memory or on disk." 
17:22 < tjfontaine> jcrew: if it's easier to delete (set null) the pointers ont he object you have instead of finding it in the array (unless you store the index of)
17:22 < cellvia> does that even apply to js
17:22 < brianc> cellvia where in the core do you see them?
17:22 < tjfontaine> they're used in timers
17:23 < cellvia> https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/_linklist.js
17:23 < bnoordhuis> cellvia: mutating and searching arrays is relatively expensive, hence the linked list
17:23 < bnoordhuis> cellvia: though it's somewhat up for debate if it's still a net benefit these days
17:23 < jcrew> tjfontaine: finding something in the array seems like the same amount of work as finding it in LL
17:24 < jcrew> loop over the thing until you get what you need, from a memory perspective that makes a lot more sense 
17:24 < cellvia> normally youd just do a loop over the array objects and break when you find it,  but with a linked list its different?
17:24 < tjfontaine> jcrew: finding for removal I mean, if I have an object I can set them null, deleting from the array is a bit harder
17:24 < niggler> deleting from array is painful
17:25 < cellvia> whats best practice for deleting from array in js
17:25 < bnoordhuis> cellvia: it's removing yourself from the array that would hurt performance-wise
17:25 < jcrew> .splice ?
17:25 < cellvia> i notife in this linked list here in node:  // show the most idle item
17:26 < cellvia> is that a extension of alinked list, or common
17:29 < jcrew> niggler: you day trade at all?
17:29 < niggler> its all day trading
17:29 < jcrew> the rebate stuff?
17:29 < niggler> there's a strange bug in the regulatory requirements
17:29 < bnoordhuis> cellvia: it can be used as a linked list/priority queue/heap hybrid
17:30 < bnoordhuis> it slices, it dices
17:30 < niggler> basically, so long as you end the day without a position, you can take on an arbitrarily large position during the day
17:30 < niggler> this is actually part of why knight capital (KCG) blew up recently
17:31 < geNAZt> does mongodb use the objectid to store information where the document is stored to get faster access to it ?
17:31 < niggler> 6 month plot: http://www.google.com/finance?q=KCG
17:32 < cellvia> this is fascinating to me, im really wondering how this is used in node... i'll look at timers
17:32 < niggler> the day it fell, it ended up taking about 440M loss due to a trading glitch
17:32 < niggler> but like with all law-of-large-numbers games, bigger is better
17:33 < cellvia> http://pod.tst.eu/http://cvs.schmorp.de/libev/ev.pod#Be_smart_about_timeouts
17:33 < jcrew> are you market making or selling short for rebates or ??, i'm unclear what you do still
17:34 < cellvia> but im noticing even in   https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/timers.js   it doesnt seem to be using _linklist
17:36 < BlissOfBeing> OK, I have posted a question on SO about merging my objects, its a little more complicated as I want to merge arrays on the same key. If anyone could point me in the right direction I would be grateful: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14161964/how-can-i-merge-arrays-that-are-on-the-same-key-javascript 
17:38 < jcrew> BlissOfBeing: use the same technique that was mentioned above and just .concat the arrays
17:40 < mmmrk> is there a way to use sharejs with geddy framework?
17:40 < woven> hi there, i'm using Socket.Io to connect a 3rd party site to a node app on our apache server. If I emit a message from the 3rd party site to the node app directly I get a success response, but If I use try to emit a message from a JS file outside of the HTML page I just get a message in the console the node debugger that says "served static content /socket.io.js"
17:42 < cellvia> BlissOfBeing I am feeling your name
17:42 < BlissOfBeing> cellvia:  :)
17:58 < cellvia> oh derp just remembered easy way to delete values from array  .filter
17:59 < geNAZt> BlissOfBeing: http://hastebin.com/ruyefisuyu.js
17:59 < ikss> hmm anyone here is using node-irc perhaps?
17:59 < geNAZt> something like that
18:04 < cellvia> oh ikss i thought that was an irc server built in node ... but just a client
18:06 < cellvia> https://github.com/alexyoung/ircd.js   i wonder how it compares to others
18:09 < ikss> cellvia: i'm using 'node-irc' and i'm having some problems with using colors ;/
18:09 < cellvia> oh and regarding _linklist,  timers.js does use it i just missed it
18:09 < nathan7> Thingy of the day: https://github.com/nathan7/microdata
18:10 < Owner> How long do .io domain purchases last if anyone knows....their site says nothing about how long you will own a domain.
18:11 < Owner> oh its one year
18:12 < geNAZt> nathan7 ? how did you get the document object into node ?
18:14 < nathan7> geNAZt: It's not for node
18:14 < nathan7> geNAZt: It should work for Browserify
18:14 < geNAZt> maybe you should write it in the readme
18:16 < FunnyLookinHat> I'm having trouble figuring out how to design a scripting engine mechanism for a basic game engine - I have an engine that updates entity positions and detects collisions and whatnot - but I want someone to be able to extend the engine with their own rules and events and whatnot
18:16 < FunnyLookinHat> Is there a clear way to do this?  I haven't thought of one in the last few days that I've been thinking about it...
18:16 < geNAZt> hooks and proxy objects ?
18:16 < FunnyLookinHat> Ideally - someone would write my-engine.js and it would listen for events from engine.js and also be able to write events to the client
18:17 < FunnyLookinHat> geNAZt, oh - using node-proxy ?
18:17 < geNAZt> no
18:22 < geNAZt> http://hastebin.com/guyunejide.js
18:23 < geNAZt> so you can pass the proxyobject direct into the plugin
18:23 < geNAZt> and the plugin should not have the chance to change the core
18:23 < geNAZt> or whatever is in the proxy
18:23 < draginx> Does anyone know how to make superagwent not send files in chunk mode?
18:24 < TomyLobo> hi
18:25 < TomyLobo> is there something like child_process.exec, except not working with a callback but returning error, stdout, stderr?
18:26 < geNAZt> no
18:26 < geNAZt> there is a child_process.spawn
18:26 < geNAZt> but the only difference is that spawn streams the content, exec waits an callbacks the content
18:26 < FunnyLookinHat> geNAZt, aaah slick thanks
18:27 < TomyLobo> geNAZt can i somehow sleep until it finishes?
18:27 < geNAZt> no
18:27 < geNAZt> thats the way node workd
18:27 < geNAZt> works*
18:27 < TomyLobo> but why not, gah, event processing is not the end-it-all
18:27 < geNAZt> never block or sleep or something like taht
18:28 < geNAZt> if u block up node, node doesnt do anything. no accept of requests, no timers, no intervals
18:28 < geNAZt> so blocking an node process is really bad
18:28 < TomyLobo> you mean it's not threaded?
18:28 < geNAZt> it is not
18:28 < geNAZt> not by default
18:28 < TomyLobo> no simultaneous handling of multiple requests?
18:28 < MI6> joyent/node: Shigeki Ohtsu master * 2b6c561 : fs: remove unused default option in WriteStream  No bufferSize option is  (+1 more commits) - http://git.io/FbXPyg
18:28 < geNAZt> in an event loop you can simultaneous handle more than one request in one time
18:29 < TomyLobo> err, no
18:29 < macmichael01> I'm trying to access an instance of my models within my app controllers but I'm not sure the proper way to do this:
18:29 < macmichael01> http://pastebin.com/1LtSBvU1
18:29 < TomyLobo> CPUs don't work that way
18:29 < geNAZt> yes
18:29 < geNAZt> while it waits for req 1, it can work on req 2
18:29 < geNAZt> if req 2 if finished it works on req 1
18:29 < TomyLobo> that's not simultaneous
18:29 < geNAZt> if req 2 has to wait for a cb it goes back to req 1
18:29 < jrajav> TomyLobo: Node.js does not use threads to achieve concurrency. Instead, it takes advantage of asynchronous functions for nearly everything.
18:30 < TomyLobo> and you can only "wait for a callback" while doing something else if you have multiple threads
18:31 < jrajav> TomyLobo: There are no *visible* threads in Node.
18:31 < geNAZt> http://hastebin.com/rirukituke.js
18:32 < geNAZt> whats about this ?
18:33 < cellvia> what about it
18:33 < geNAZt> if you block in one of these callbacks nothing will execute while in the block
18:33 < geNAZt> so it is bad
18:33 < ikss> tjfontaine: are You around?
18:34 < daslicht> is therer something like assetic from Symfony2 for node / express? 
18:34 < cellvia> geNAZt i dont understand, could you show an example
18:34 < ikss> daslicht: there is at least few modules out there for connect 
18:34 < daslicht> that you can put all asstes in one arbitrary folder and like assets ?
18:35 < daslicht> how are those modules named ?
18:35 < geNAZt> http://hastebin.com/xivupopisi.js
18:35 < geNAZt> if the interval 1 hits it blocks the node while calculating the for loop
18:35 < cellvia> yeah
18:35 < geNAZt> so interval 2 will not be fired
18:35 < geNAZt> and the http server will not accept any requests
18:35 < cellvia> until 1 is done
18:35 < geNAZt> right
18:36 < cellvia> but yeah thats not the same as simultaneous
18:36 < cellvia> thats very not simultaneous
18:36 < geNAZt> thats right
18:36 < geNAZt> i want to show why it isnt good to block on node
18:36 < cellvia> gotcha
18:37 < geNAZt> that node can handle various functions in the "same" time
18:37 < geNAZt> if u dont block
18:37 < mscdex> node.js rules!
18:37 < cellvia> i agree
18:37 < cellvia> what other languages are singlethreaded in this way?
18:37 < geNAZt> so it is bad to "wait" for a exec to end
18:39 < geNAZt> i dont know but is tornado single threaded ?
18:39 < cellvia> clojure?
18:39 < geNAZt> spidermonkey
18:39 < geNAZt> :D
18:40 < geNAZt> or seed
18:43 <@konobi> evented systems are available for most languages
18:43 < cellvia> but most use threads yeah?
18:44 <@konobi> not implicitly
18:45 <@konobi> most are just plain old blocking
18:46 < tnorris> bnoordhuis: mind if I add the basic sequence of fetch/ff/rebase to the Contributing wiki page? seems like a lot of people don't fully understand this workflow.
18:52 < tnorris> nm, found the for dummies page.
19:00 < link15> hey all, how does node compare to other frameworks / servers with respect to handling a lot of persistent socket connections
19:00 < link15> i know there is no one answer
19:02 <@konobi> excellent
19:02 < tjfontaine> ikss: what seems to be the issue?
19:11 < rideh> what form mailer are people using these days?
19:27 < CoverSlide> so go's channels or java's nio don't use threads internally?
19:28 < superjoe> does anyone have any opinions they'd like to share with me about using bind vs var self = this ?
19:28 < CoverSlide> superjoe: sure. you have to use bind if you're calling a named function outside of the parent function's scope
19:29 < superjoe> CoverSlide, true, or you could move the named function inside the scope of the parent
19:29 < CoverSlide> superjoe: but if it's a function that is reusable across multiple functions, there's no reason to copy paste the same thing into different parents to achieve that goal
19:30 < superjoe> agreed
19:30 < cellvia> how does var self = this replace bind?  not saying it doesnt but i dont follow how that replicates
19:30 < cellvia> oh i see, saving the scope
19:31 < CoverSlide> otherwise, for functions you create inside the parent, i think self is the best way to go
19:31 < CoverSlide> i think there's some performance loss by using bind
19:31 < cellvia> yeah?
19:31 < CoverSlide> not 100% sure
19:31 < cellvia> i just like bind because it makes me feel like a badass
19:32 < owen1> anyone that uses deploy (https://github.com/visionmedia/deploy) know if it's possible to deploy to multiple hosts? dev1, dev2, etc?
19:32 < cellvia> flippin functions like no one business
19:32 < CoverSlide> that said, usually I use `on('event', this.myFunction.bind(this));`
19:32 < CoverSlide> ALTHOUGH
19:33 < superjoe> cellvia, https://gist.github.com/4455229
19:33 < CoverSlide> if you want to make it more performant, and you assign that event handler more than once, it might be in your best interest on instantiation to prebind it to `this`
19:33 < cellvia> nice coverslide
19:33 < cellvia> i like that
19:33 < cellvia> yeah
19:34 < cellvia> you flippin functions too
19:34 < superjoe> owen1, not sure, but I just made this recently and it may or may not fit your needs: https://github.com/indabamusic/rodent
19:34 < mgeary> hi folks. learning about node.js. I'm trying to get dali running, and even though i've installed the "daemon" module, i'm getting the error, "Cannot find module './daemon.v0.8.16'". Suggestions?
19:34 < cellvia> bind is like my fav thing about js, from my modest experience so far
19:36 < CoverSlide> yeah, it's something that should have been in the language from the beginning. It's not in ES3 at all
19:36 < CoverSlide> but it's easily shimmable
19:37 < owen1> superjoe: interesting. thanks
19:38 < cellvia> superjoe LOL to that squirrel picture
19:38 < jcrugzz> you can do some very clever things with bind. Haven't gotten in the habit of using it yet. Still relatively new to js
19:39 < cellvia> i think one of the cleverst js things i had to do was extracting a function from onclick in the markup, adding some functionality beforehand and appending it back to the end that while maintaining the event scope
19:39 < TomyLobo> most clever*
19:39 < cellvia> ...  i stand by cleverst
19:40 < cellvia> language.most.bind('clever')
19:41 < rodyhaddad> If I have the `exports` object of a module, is there a way to access its `module` object?
19:42 < cellvia> what do you mean, from outside?
19:42 < cellvia> confused
19:43 < cellvia> the poitn is to put what you need in module.exports isnt it
19:44 < rodyhaddad> yes, but I mean, is there a way of doing module.exports.module? :p I guess not
19:45 < cellvia> haha
19:45 < cellvia> hmm
19:45 < cellvia> well just put what you want from module in there
19:46 < cellvia> or you could clone module object
19:46 < jcrugzz> rodyhaddad: not quite sure what your use case is but you can look at a module's parent module. http://nodejs.org/api/modules.html
19:47 < cellvia> jcrugzz whoa.  nice. i did not know that
19:47 < rodyhaddad> if it's possible to do that, then someone could do: var k = require("./test"); k.module.exports = otherObject; // that way the next person that does require("./test") will get otherObject instead of the initial value of the module
19:48 < cellvia> good point
19:48 < rodyhaddad> It's "stupid" I know, but could be useful for some librairies
19:54 < jcrugzz> this is exactly why I love javascript, it inspires creativity
19:56 < sshaginyan> Can someone explain to me how this works? var x  = []; x['one'] = 1;. then x becomes an associative array kinda like an object…..??? If this is so how do I initialize an array with key and val?
19:56 < sshaginyan> Like this var options = ['new':1, 'edit':2, 'del':3, 'run':4, 'done':5];
19:57 < sshaginyan> I can also do var x = []; x[0] = 1; then x['one'] = 2; which gives me [1, one:2] ……
19:58 < tjfontaine> sshaginyan: to make the jit love you the most, it's best to not mix your key types
19:58 < tjfontaine> sshaginyan: for your sanity and the sake of the optimizer, ignore the fact that you can do what you just did in js
19:58 < sshaginyan> lol
19:59 < geNAZt> yes
19:59 < sshaginyan> I understand that an array is also an object
19:59 < geNAZt> integer keyed array are awesome fast in v8
19:59 < geNAZt> anything else with slow it down
19:59 < sshaginyan> tjfontaine: But I would love to initialize it with keys 
19:59 < sshaginyan> But I need it.....
19:59 < geNAZt> you can
19:59 < tjfontaine> sshaginyan: then var a = {key: value};
19:59 < geNAZt> object ?
19:59 < sshaginyan> that's an object
19:59 < geNAZt> y and ?
19:59 < sshaginyan> upper level then array
20:00 < tjfontaine> sshaginyan: because that's what you're asking for
20:00 < cellvia> whats wrong with it being an object
20:00 < cellvia> if you need to call array functions you can
20:00 < geNAZt> an object in javascript can contain anything
20:00 < geNAZt> but you should avoid to change it often
20:01 < cellvia> what are you thinking to do that you couldnt this way
20:01 < mgeary> so, i'm hitting this jsdom "Cannot read property 'implementation' of undefined" error. One fix suggests that you need to have python 2.7+ installed. I have 2.6.5, and upgrading it isn't really an option. Any suggestions?
20:02 < cellvia> yeah, dont use jsdom
20:02 < mgeary> cellvia: any *other* suggestions?
20:02 < mgeary> is there an alternative to jsdom?
20:02 < cellvia> yes trying to remember the name
20:02 < mgeary> i'm trying to get server side chart rendering via HighCharts
20:02 < mgeary> but keep hitting snags
20:02 < cellvia> nice
20:03 < cellvia> yeah that sounds crazy
20:03 < cellvia> cheerio
20:03 < cellvia> thats it
20:03 < mgeary> just found that
20:04 < cellvia> https://github.com/MatthewMueller/cheerio
20:04 < cellvia> worked well forme but dunno your use case
20:04 < mgeary> yeah. just nap installed that
20:05 < mgeary> but i don't yet know how to use it instead of jsdom
20:05 < cellvia> jsdom was a huge pain in the ass
20:05 < cellvia> thers a few articles on it
20:05 < cellvia> godgle it
20:07 < mgeary> bah
20:07 < mgeary> every piece of existing node+highcharts code wants jsdom
20:08 < cellvia> link
20:08 < mgeary> https://github.com/davidpadbury/node-highcharts
20:08 < mgeary> started there
20:08 < mgeary> then ambled over here: https://github.com/metricfire/dali
20:09 < cellvia> yeah cheerio doesnt really emulate thw window env 
20:09 < mgeary> that dali one might work, but it wants "daemon", which is apparently deprecated. I'm running node 0.8.16, and apparently it doesn't like daemon
20:09 < cellvia> you would have to adapt the library to use cheerio
20:10 < cellvia> might not be as hard as it seems
20:10 < mgeary> possibly not
20:10 < ikss> tjfontaine: still here? :D
20:10 < mgeary> trying to get a bare-bones equivalent going in cheerio
20:10 < tjfontaine> ikss: yes
20:10 < cellvia> may i ask what you consider the main reason to do the chart rendering client side?
20:10 < cellvia> i am working on an app using highcharts client side
20:10 < mgeary> cellvia: heh. that's a long story
20:10 < cellvia> er sorry, main reason for server side
20:11 < ikss> tjfontaine: i'm trying to use node-irc and i'm looking on your MI6 bot cause i'm having a problem with colors on irc... any ideas why they are ignored? ;/
20:11 < mgeary> but the shortest answer is that the "client" in this case is actually a Titanium iPad application
20:11 < mgeary> and the SVG generation routine is quite taxing on that processor
20:11 < cellvia> mgeary ah hah, interesting
20:11 < tjfontaine> ikss: are you passing a literal ^C and the channel isn't +c?
20:11 < cellvia> mgeary yeah good point
20:11 < cellvia> mgeary maybe i should consider it
20:11  * mgeary feels validated
20:11 < cellvia> mgeary lol
20:11 < ikss> tjfontaine: at this moment i'm using your functions from bot.js format_*
20:11 < mgeary> cellvia: well, if you can help me get this going, i'd be happy to share
20:11 < ikss> theBrettman: channel +c hmmm ;-D good question
20:12 < ikss> tjfontaine: *
20:12 < mgeary> i've got a fair bit of js experience, but am new, as of today, to node
20:12 < cellvia> mgeary im actually in the middle of mentally putting together how this app will work, so i will consider that as part of it
20:12 < mgeary> plenty of python/django, PHP, etc. experience, but all this node stuff is overwhelming
20:12 < cellvia> mgeary i inherited it and i have to say the json structures being passed to the browser are really terrible
20:12 < cellvia> mgeary seems like too many weird arrays of arrays and stuff
20:13 < cellvia> mgeary might be nice to render it server side
20:13 < iksik> tjfontaine: uhhh it is +c ;/
20:13 < geNAZt> maybe you should use a full canvas render for that
20:13 < cellvia> what do you mean geNAZt
20:13 < geNAZt> https://github.com/davidberneda/TeeChart
20:13 < geNAZt> something like that
20:14 < mgeary> too late for that
20:14 < mgeary> on my end
20:14 < cellvia> we have a highcharts license so i may as well use it i think
20:14 < mgeary> already resorting to node is a last-ditch effort to improve performance
20:14 < mgeary> yeah, also that
20:15 < tjfontaine> iksik: ya, you're fighting the ircd then, make it -c and continue testing :)
20:15 < cellvia> teechart looks like you have to buy it
20:15 < iksik> tjfontaine: i'm not very familliar with freenode, i was trying to remove it but... heh "c ntcslk MODE cannot be set due to channel having an active MLOCK restriction policy"
20:16 < cellvia> and not much activity on the github
20:16 < tjfontaine> iksik: that means you'll need to use chanserv to modify it
20:16 < iksik> oh
20:16 < iksik> hm
20:16 < cellvia> geNAZt but i like the idea of using canvas that way
20:16 < tjfontaine> iksik: see /msg chanserv help set mlock
20:17 < geNAZt> you dont need to go around jsdom
20:17 < mgeary> cellvia: so, i've got a hello world working with Cheerio. How would i load up highcharts in the 'document' ?
20:17 < cellvia> mgeary i like this idea of server side charting cause you could cache the images, depending on the timing of the data
20:17 < iksik> tjfontaine: done, thanks ;-)
20:17 < geNAZt> and load a heck of html
20:18 < tjfontaine> iksik: you're welcome
20:18 < mgeary> cellvia: indeed
20:18 < geNAZt> only to parse a highchart out of it :D
20:18 < cellvia> yeah mgeary im not so sure that you could with cheerio, cause its mainly meant for scraping and emulating jquery rather than emulating a browser
20:19 < geNAZt> you could wirte a full html and then give it to cheerio ?
20:19 < mgeary> so maybe i *do* have to see about taking the server to Python 2.7.x
20:19 < mgeary> bah
20:19 < geNAZt> and then select it out with "jQuery"
20:19 < mgeary> always something
20:20 < cellvia> well how does the chart end up, literally as binary image file
20:20 < cellvia> or svg?
20:20 < cellvia> with serverside highchart
20:20 < geNAZt> highchart is svg
20:20 < mgeary> the plan is to write out a svg file
20:20 < geNAZt> so a html with and id containing only the svg should work
20:20 < cellvia> so youre saying its the highcarts building of that svg file that is taxing the titanium app?  not the rendering of the svg?
20:20 < geNAZt> so you can select the content of that id
20:21 < mgeary> cellvia: correct. it's the pulling out of the SVG. We do that because a PDF is being created. Again, we couldn't do that client-side, so we do it serverside
20:21 < mgeary> currently, the client sends up raw SVG data to the server
20:22 < mgeary> but pulling that SVG from a given Highcharts instance takes several seconds
20:22 < mgeary> and we have to do it 4+ times per email sent, so the user is sometimes waiting 20+ seconds
20:22 < mgeary> unacceptable
20:22 < cellvia> right
20:22 < geNAZt> are the charts dynamic ?
20:22 < mgeary> yeah
20:22 < geNAZt> how often are they changed ?
20:22 < mgeary> generated by data gathered at the client
20:22 < geNAZt> ah ok
20:23 < cellvia> so you want to send the dynamic gen data to the server, render the highchart put it into a pdf and email it?
20:23 < mgeary> yeap
20:23 < bradleymeck> mgeary have you done profiling to see what the bottleneck is specifically?
20:23 < cellvia> so you dont even need to display the chart in any way on the client
20:23 < mgeary> bradleymeck: yep.
20:24 < cellvia> just email it in pdf form?
20:24 < mgeary> cellvia: well, we do, but client-side, we display 1 chart, whereas in the PDF, we break that out into many sub-charts
20:24 < cellvia> ok i see
20:24 <@konobi> why not request all of them at the same time?
20:25 < mgeary> konobi: looooong wait
20:25 <@konobi> "several seconds"
20:25 < cellvia> i think he is requesting them all at the same time, but just not building them client side
20:25 <@konobi> serially or in parallel?
20:26 < mgeary> konobi: this is a poor little iPad processor we're talking about. Serially
20:26 < mgeary> but believe me, doing this client side isn't going to work
20:26 < cellvia> i dont see why jsdom is even necessary to get this out of highcharts clientside, or cheerio
20:26 < mgeary> that could well be
20:27 < cellvia> if youre just grabbing the generated svg
20:27 < cellvia> just find where thats output in the code, and circumvent any of the other stuff
20:27 < cellvia> as in, all the DOM stuff
20:28 < cellvia> but i dunno it may be heavily dependent on jquery
20:28 < cellvia> take a look
20:28 < geNAZt> https://github.com/davidpadbury/node-highcharts/blob/master/lib/highcharts/highcharts.src.js
20:28 <@konobi> Chart.getSVG()
20:29 < geNAZt> you get the error on building jsdom ?
20:29 < mgeary> right. that's exactly what i'm trying
20:30 < mgeary> well
20:30 < geNAZt> windows or unix ?
20:30 <@konobi> rendered offscreen?
20:30 < mgeary> unix
20:30 < geNAZt> debian ?
20:30 < mgeary> ubuntu, yeah
20:30 < geNAZt> maybe try to compile it on an other machine and import the lib
20:30 < mgeary> the problem is, David Padbury doesn't give me all the code i think i need
20:31 < cellvia> konobi where are you seeing that
20:31 <@konobi> cellvia: the docs
20:31 < cellvia> ah... hmm not seeing it in the src
20:32 < cellvia> oh i see
20:32 < cellvia> https://github.com/davidpadbury/node-highcharts/blob/master/lib/highcharts/exporting.src.js
20:32 < geNAZt> i compiled jsdom on a debian machine
20:32 < geNAZt> oO
20:32 < geNAZt> with python 2.6.6
20:33 <@konobi> cairosvg?
20:34 < cellvia> "Highcharts uses either jQuery, MooTools or Prototype for some common JavaScript tasks."
20:34 < Virunga> Hi guys, i want to receive in soft-real-time all messages of an irc channel. Could you give me an advice about whether to use only the node's http server, maintaining opened the connection, or use some other tool like socket.io, for example?
20:34 < Virunga> Highcharts is really cool.
20:35 < theBrettman> ikss: what question? It's been so long, I forgot!
20:35 < cellvia> mgeary if its easier you could load something besides jquery for highcharts to use
20:35 <@konobi> zepto
20:36 < cellvia> oh yeah, i bet thatd cover it
20:38 < cellvia> its using jquery  extend,  grep, bind, unbind, get
20:38 < cellvia> and animation/ fx
20:38 < cellvia> but most of that you wouldnt need
20:38 < cellvia> for server side
20:38 < geNAZt> i try to get the error u got for jsdom on building
20:38 < geNAZt> but i dont get it Oo
20:39 < cellvia> geNAZt, ive had issues and had to do what he is avoiding, python 2.7  
20:39 < cellvia> in my case ia ctually had to downgrade my python
20:39 < geNAZt> y i got that
20:39 < mgeary> i didn't get a problem installing jsdom. i just keep getting this implementation error. Sorry, on the phone. Distracted
20:39 < geNAZt> but when i npm install jsdom
20:39 < geNAZt> i dont get errors
20:39 < geNAZt> with phyton 2.6.6
20:39 < geNAZt> python*
20:39 < cellvia> what OS?
20:40 < mgeary> geNAZt:  same
20:40 < geNAZt> debian 6
20:41 < Musk> Debian woot woot :3
20:41 < geNAZt> <3 debian :D
20:44 < cellvia> this is very interesting to me as i may be able to use it for my app, the non-DOM jquery use in highcharts seems minimal so it should be fairly easy to feed it a stripped down jquery for these purposes
20:45 < mgeary> sorry. back now
20:45 <@konobi> https://github.com/fgnass/zepto-node
20:46 <@konobi> mgeary: if you have the svg string, why not just feed it into something like cairosvg?
20:47 < mgeary> konobi: it's *getting* the SVG string that takes all the work
20:47 < mgeary> what's easy is the raw data for the chart
20:47 <@konobi> ah... =0)
20:48 < mgeary> i could possibly get python 2.7 on my server, if that would make these other issues go away
20:48 < mgeary> can anyone confirm that it would?
20:48 < geNAZt> do you have a test server ?
20:48 < mgeary> this is basically a test server
20:48 < mgeary> hasn't gone to production yet
20:48 < geNAZt> then you can give it a try ?
20:48 < mgeary> yeah
20:48 < mgeary> but i don't know if my node code is even correct
20:49 < geNAZt> you would see it then
20:49 < geNAZt> :D
20:49 < mgeary> well
20:49 < mgeary> so, if we look at this "Usage" code:
20:49 < mgeary> https://github.com/davidpadbury/node-highcharts
20:50 < cellvia> mgeary i cant confirm but i know it worked for me for other things ive had issues with (i think for me it was actually node-gyp or something like that)
20:50 < cellvia> all i know is i did not enjoy working with jsdom and it was very slow
20:50 < geNAZt> y but it should be able to get it running 
20:50 < mgeary> ok, so on that code ^^, what i actually get is this:
20:51 < mgeary> http://dpaste.com/863858/
20:51 < cellvia> i dont see anything about python in there
20:51 < mgeary> well
20:52 < geNAZt> console.dir( window ); before line 6 ?
20:52 < mgeary> i've pursued many avenues, with varying failures. this is the failure i get from *this* avenue
20:52 < mgeary> geNAZt: ReferenceError: window is not defined
20:53 < cellvia> seems like a code issue to me
20:53 < mgeary> well
20:53 < mgeary> again, i believe that the "Usage" from David is incomplete
20:53 <@konobi> pastebin code!
20:53 < mgeary> konobi: https://github.com/davidpadbury/node-highcharts
20:53 < cellvia> lol
20:53 < cellvia> are you saying the code you're using is the demo code
20:54 <@konobi> mgeary: http://blog.davidpadbury.com/2010/10/03/using-nodejs-to-render-js-charts-on-server/
20:54 < mgeary> as a starting point, yes. that's one thing i've tried
20:54 < mgeary> konobi: yes
20:54 < geNAZt> well if u look at the repo
20:54 < geNAZt> its 2 years old
20:54 < mgeary> konobi: the code on that page requires me to connect more dots than i can with my current node-fu
20:54 < geNAZt> and it uses the last version of jsdom
20:54 < geNAZt> maybe they changed the api
20:54 < mgeary> and yes, 2 years is a bit concerning
20:55 < geNAZt> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11301119/jsdom-document-createwindow-returns-empty-for-non-empty-document
20:55 < geNAZt> jsdom.jsdom().createWindow() => jsdom().document.createWindow() ?
20:56 < geNAZt> jsdom.jsdom().createWindow() => jsdom.jsdom().document.createWindow() ?
20:56 < geNAZt> sry
20:57 < cellvia> https://github.com/davidpadbury/node-highcharts/blob/master/lib/node-highcharts.js
20:58 < cellvia> ok i cant looka t this anymore brings back bad jsdom flashbacks
20:58 < cellvia> gl i will let you know if i end up doing anything w/ server side highcharts
20:58 < mgeary> thanks :S
20:58 <@konobi> mgeary: why not try with plain jsdom and highcharts
20:59 < mgeary> i'd be happy to
20:59 < mgeary> i'm game for *anything* at this point
20:59 < geNAZt> have u tried the fix ?
20:59 < cellvia> if it were me i'd do zepto
21:00 <@konobi> k... well you can runInNewContext to execute the plain highcharts code
21:00 < cellvia> and reference node-highcharts
21:01 < mgeary> geNAZt: TypeError: Cannot call method 'createWindow' of undefined
21:01 < mgeary> jsdom.jsdom().document is undefined
21:02 <@konobi> mgeary: i'd ignore node-highcharts all together
21:02 < mgeary> sure
21:02 <@konobi> the blog would make for an interesting start
21:02 < mgeary> well, like i say, i found this-- https://github.com/metricfire/dali
21:02 < mgeary> which looked very promising
21:02 <@konobi> but update it based on current api offerings
21:03 <@konobi> mgeary: nice!
21:03 < mgeary> but i can't get it to work either
21:03 < mgeary> it uses "daemon", which maybe(?) isn't compatible with my version of node...?
21:03 < cellvia> "Caches chart objects, re-uses them for requests that only change the data"  thats cool
21:03 < mgeary> though i'd be happy to downgrade my node, if that's all a fix required
21:05 < mgeary> i run it first, and it says, "Error: Cannot find module 'daemon'"
21:05 <@konobi> mgeary: did you clone and then run `npm install .` ?
21:05 < mgeary> so i npm install daemon
21:05 < mgeary> and it installs daemon 0.5.1
21:06 < cellvia> where is the package.json file
21:06 < cellvia> there is none
21:06 < cellvia> lame
21:07 < cellvia> you dont know what versions it needs
21:07 < mgeary> bah. well… okay, i got some modules installed, and now i'm back to "Cannot call method 'createElement' of undefined"
21:07 < mgeary> same code as that other one
21:07 < cellvia> have you tried jsom by itself
21:07 < cellvia> to see if it works
21:07 < cellvia> jsdom
21:09 < mgeary> this doesn't throw an error: document = jsdom('<!doctype html><html><body>hello jsdom</body></html>');
21:09 < mgeary> but i still get an empty dict when i call document.createWindow();
21:10 < mgeary> looks like i need contextify?
21:10 < cellvia> ah yes, contextify i remember causing probs
21:10 < mgeary> should i require it in my code? or just install it?
21:11 < cellvia> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10226301/building-contextify-under-windows-7-x64-for-nodejs-jquery
21:11 < cellvia> maybe not useful for you but yeah, i had to get python 2.7 going
21:11 < cellvia> and a bunch o visual studio stuff
21:12 < cellvia> just try 2.7 py
21:13 < mgeary> is there a sub-version needed?
21:13 < mgeary> 2.7.2 okay?
21:14 < daoudi> hi
21:15 < daoudi> anyone can help me
21:15 < mgeary> daoudi: that remains to be seen ;)
21:16 < daoudi> im new in node.js and im facing a problem an need your help
21:16 <@Nexxy> daoudi, if you have a particular question, please ask :) even better if you have some code to paste (via some sort of paste service such as gisthub.com)
21:17 < valterguy> gisthub?
21:17 <@Nexxy> gisthub
21:17 < valterguy> wow. they have that registered...
21:17 <@Nexxy> of course :)
21:17 < valterguy> you learn something new every day. :)
21:17 <@Nexxy> it's easier than typing gist.github.com 
21:17 < valterguy> you're skipping just one dot...
21:17 < valterguy> but okay. :D
21:17 < valterguy> oh wait. git toO!
21:18 < daoudi> i have installed node.js on my ubuntu everything is working fine but when i create a new folder in my www folder im not able to use npm 
21:18 <@Nexxy> 11 vs 15 keysrokes
21:18 < valterguy> Nexxy: yeah. noticed that git disappears from github. silly me.
21:18 <@Nexxy> daoudi, sounds like a permissions error?
21:18 < mgeary> ok, so i have python2.7 installed now
21:18 < valterguy> daoudi: do you get an exact error?
21:18 < mgeary> cellvia: how do i get node to use that python?
21:19 < cellvia> i had to fix path
21:19 < cellvia> to reference the older versio
21:19 < cellvia> or in your case, i guess the newer version
21:20 < s5fs> Nexxy: hai
21:20 < mgeary> is that in a node config somewhere?
21:20 < daoudi> npm install was able to install mongoose but node jade i got this erro pm ERR! Error: EROFS, symlink '../jade/bin/jade'
21:20 <@Nexxy> ERMAHGERD S5FS O HAI
21:20 < cellvia> your path var
21:20 < cellvia> its not node config i think it drops to commandline
21:21  * valterguy wonders if daoudi's problem is related to https://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues/2423 
21:22 < valterguy> daoudi: you could try installing globally then...
21:23 < daoudi> if i run the same command in the same path where the node folder it works but it doesn't work if i run the command in my projects folder
21:23 < valterguy> what are the permissions there?
21:24 < daoudi> 775
21:24 < valterguy> and are you the owner or in the owner group?
21:25 < daoudi> yes
21:26 < shakefon> looking for a MySQL Database as a Service recommendation, or hosted with external access, AWS RDS a bit on the pricey side for 24/7 operation. Anyone able to recommend?
21:26 < daoudi> it installs the mangoose but not the jade
21:26 < valterguy> daoudi: weird... don't know really then.
21:27 < valterguy> daoudi: all I can suggest is trying to install it globally, if that is a viable option.
21:27 < L10n> could you install it in a separate folder and then copy it over?
21:27 < wankdanker> daoudi: what is the filesystem type in which the www folder resides? and more specifically, does it support symlinks?

21:36 < astropirate> Greetings comrades
21:37 < cellvia> greetings :)
21:37 < cellvia> if i want to communicate with a node process from a cronjob,  is there a better way than doing a GET request ?
21:37 < tjfontaine> huh?
21:38 < cellvia> lol forgive me.  i am a noob.  but the way ive seen it done before (communicating to php) was setting cronjobs that would do get request to the framework
21:38 < cellvia> triggering a cascade of functions
21:38 < cellvia> based on the api setup
21:39 < shakefon> cellvia: what are you trying to achieve overall?
21:39 < cellvia> i want to have a node process that runs reports at intervals
21:39 < cellvia> long intervals
21:39 < tjfontaine> do you already have an http listener active?
21:39 < cellvia> monthly, weekly, daily
21:40 < cellvia> well, i was thinking of makign this a separate node process, with an http listener
21:40 < tjfontaine> do what you know how to do
21:40 < mgeary> okay, so i've got python2.7 running, re-installed jsdom, and now i get a *different* error
21:40 < cellvia> lol, well... i guess that was my question, if there is a better way
21:41 < mgeary> http://dpaste.com/863983/
21:41 < tjfontaine> cellvia: there are numerous ways to achieve it, I vote for you doing what you feel the most comfortable with
21:41 < shakefon> can you just run the node process directly e.g. for daily at midnight - 0 0 * * * /usr/local/bin/node /path/to/your/node/script.js
21:42 < mgeary> cellvia, geNAZt, now i don't get that implementation error, but window.jQuery evaluates to undefined
21:42 < cellvia> hrm
21:42 < cellvia> let me think on that shakefon, i might be able to adapt to that 
21:42 < tjfontaine> */5 * * * * node reporter 5minavg
21:42 < mgeary> so $(<anything) doesn't work
21:43 < shakefon> cellvia: if you do that, then your node script.js runs the report and exits, that should negate the need for any sort of HTTP interaction
21:43 < cellvia> im not very experienced with crons,  can i add flags
21:43 < cellvia> right
21:43 < cellvia> i like that
21:43 < cellvia> but i need to be able to tell node what the frequency of the cron is
21:43 < shakefon> cellvia: if you have your node script accept arguments from STDIN, you could specify flags 
21:44 < cellvia> right
21:44 < cellvia> ok
21:44 < cellvia> i may do that
21:44 < shakefon> you could tell node via another argument
21:44 < shakefon> why would it need to be aware of the frequency, out of interest?
21:44 < cellvia> yeah i would just do a -f flag  or just straight put -weekly
21:44 < cellvia> --weekly
21:44 < shakefon> oh so for the type of report, yea makes sense
21:44 < cellvia> im going to have a library o metrics
21:45 < cellvia> some need to be updated only weekly, daily, etc
21:45 < cellvia> i dont want to run ALL the reports every time
21:45 < cellvia> when the person makes their report module they have to put a custom prop in the package.json
21:45 < mgeary> oho. i've got jsdom working!
21:45 < cellvia> that says frequency
21:45 < cellvia> congrats mgeary let me know if you get the whole shebang going
21:46 < mgeary> long ways from there, i fear
21:46 < mgeary> but hard to say
21:46 < cellvia> maybe not
21:46 < myndzi> is something like zeromq better than ipc communication if you're doing a lot of back-and-forth?
21:47 < cellvia> i thought zeromq was ipc
21:47 < cellvia> i think mikeal posted an article on something like that
21:47 < cellvia> avoiding using a job queue
21:47 < cellvia> hol don
21:47 < tjfontaine> message queuing is a form of ip
21:47 < tjfontaine> c
21:48 < myndzi> well, except when it's sockets i guess
21:48 < myndzi> i mean
21:48 < myndzi> between different systems entirely
21:48 < cellvia> http://www.mikealrogers.com/posts/scaling-realtime.html
21:48 < tjfontaine> myndzi: when you say IPC you mean shared memory?
21:48 <@konobi> still ipc
21:48 < myndzi> i guess so :)
21:49 <@konobi> sysv ipc?
21:49 < myndzi> thanks @ link
21:49 < tjfontaine> (there's also memory sans these days, so it all breaks down)
21:49 < myndzi> i don't know konobi, i mean, i guess two computers is inter process as much as two processes on one computer
21:49 <@konobi> yes
21:49 < myndzi> memory sans?
21:51 < chovy> anybody else notice gmail being really slow the last few days?
21:51 < k_89> question: is there any way of specifying the dependencies of your project using package.json ?
21:52 < cellvia> isnt that kind of what its for?
21:52 <@konobi> k_89: https://npmjs.org/doc/json.html
21:53 < chovy> konobi: npm install some_package --save
21:53 < chovy> will automatically add it
21:53 < k_89> k, thanks
21:53 < cellvia> nice chovy didnt kno that
21:53 < chovy> sorry, that was for k_89 
21:53 < k_89> haha
21:53 < cellvia> im sure konobi appreciates it too
21:53 <@konobi> o.O
21:54 <@konobi> shrinkwrap is also useful
21:54 < chovy> i think gmail is slower because of warrantless wiretapping.
21:54 < cellvia> lol
21:54 < cellvia> do you really think they werent already doing that
21:54 < chovy> all my interactions now have to be crunched by some CIA mainframe before i open them.
21:55 < cellvia> damn thats like china stylez
21:55 < chovy> that's true, all they did was renew the law
21:55 < chovy> must be something else.
21:55 < cellvia> internet damn slow in china
21:56 < mgeary> bah
21:56 < mgeary> i'm getting CLOSE
21:56 < cellvia> mgeary you have  a thick callous on your forehead yet?
21:56 < mgeary> cellvia: seriously
21:57 < mgeary> i'm now getting a Chart object
21:57 < mgeary> but it doesn't have a getSVG method
21:57 < mgeary> maybe that's old code
21:57 < cellvia> thats cuz you gotta include the exportable
21:57 < mgeary> oho
21:57 < cellvia> theres the highcharts library
21:57 < mgeary> awesome
21:57 < cellvia> and the exportable extension
21:58 < cellvia> you should be good now
21:58 < cellvia> *excited*
21:58 < mgeary> BOO YAH!!!!
21:58  * mgeary is looking at server side SVG
21:58 < cellvia> heck yeah
21:58 < mgeary> of course, it's not for MY chart
21:58 < mgeary> just for a hello world example
21:58 < mgeary> but from here it OUGHT to be good
21:58 < mgeary> sheesh
21:59 < cellvia> hello world has been cause or celebration, many times.
21:59 < cellvia> for*
21:59 < geNAZt> gz :D
21:59 < cellvia> mgeary what were the main things you had to do
21:59 < cellvia> for future reference
22:00 < mgeary> i'll pastebin my view
22:01 < cellvia> im really excited to use iannix to feed a OSC stream into various nodejs transform pipes that modify them and output to Reaper which has OSC support
22:01 < mgeary> http://dpaste.com/863995/
22:02 < mgeary> so, other than that, i just installed Python2.7 uninstalled jsdom, and reinstalled it with python2.7 as my default python
22:02 < cellvia> hell yeah
22:02 < cellvia> and it renders perfect?
22:02 < mgeary> well
22:02 < mgeary> i need to save the SVG out to a file and test that
22:02 < mgeary> one sec
22:04 < mgeary> ah
22:04 < mgeary> well
22:04 < mgeary> no, it looks terrible
22:04 < cellvia> lol
22:05 < cellvia> wonderful
22:05 < mgeary> but
22:05 < mgeary> from here i should be able to wire in my actual chart, and then i could compare the node SVG with the SVG from my client
22:05 < mgeary> and figure out what the difference is
22:05 < mgeary> even if i have to massage the SVG after pulling it out, i'm fine with that
22:06 < cellvia> try your helloworld chart on client
22:06 < cellvia> see how diff it is
22:06 < cellvia> very curious
22:06 < mgeary> easier said than done
22:06 < mgeary> but that's a good idea
22:06 < cellvia> well, i mean on any browser
22:07 < cellvia> just to see if its highcharts or what
22:07 < mgeary> right
22:07 < cellvia> also as someone said before this is 2 years old highcharts api may have changed
22:07 < cellvia> since then
22:07 < mgeary> yeah
22:08 < mgeary> well
22:08 < mgeary> for that matter, i'll put in a different hello world chart from highcharts.com
22:08 < cellvia> gi
22:09 < CoverSlide> joe?
22:09 < MI6> joyent/node: Johannes Ewald v0.8 * 872cb0d : doc: improve example of process.hrtime()  The example clarifies now that  - http://git.io/F2FlPg
22:10 < CoverSlide> XML is Terrible. SVG is XML. Therefore SVG is terrible.
22:10 < nlf> that's the transitive property
22:12 < geNAZt> svg is okay
22:12 < geNAZt> i dont know any vector based graphics for the web
22:12 < CoverSlide> well it's a standard
22:12 < mgeary> XML isn't terrible
22:12 < CoverSlide> being standard doesn't make it good
22:12 < mgeary> most people who hate XML really just hate Java
22:12 < CoverSlide> yes it is
22:12 < mgeary> and i can agree with that ;)
22:13 < CoverSlide> actually, i hate xml because it's probably one of the stupedist designs for data serialization
22:13 < CoverSlide> the fact that html became popular and then some people thought "hey, html would be good for transporting data"
22:13 < CoverSlide> but it's not
22:13 < mgeary> uhh
22:13 < geNAZt> xml as a data transport is messy yes
22:14 < mgeary> you've got the cart before the horse there
22:14 < geNAZt> but it is not a fail :D
22:14 < CoverSlide> xml came out after html
22:14 < CoverSlide> and much after sgml
22:14 < mgeary> HTML and XML both came from SGML
22:14 < CoverSlide> yes
22:14 < mgeary> which was a way to mark up data
22:14 < mgeary> == transport
22:14 < Virunga> If i remove a socket from the agent's pool triggering the removeAgent event, should i close the socket after?
22:14 < geNAZt> would you like to write a webpage in json ?
22:14 < CoverSlide> no, sgml and html were ways to mark up documents
22:14 < geNAZt> or in ini ?
22:15 < CoverSlide> you don't see anyone using TeX to transport data?
22:15 < geNAZt> but xml + xslt would do fine
22:15 < CoverSlide> yes, if you've already structured your data to fit inside xml
22:15 < mgeary> cellvia: getting some JS errors using a chart def. from HC
22:16 < cellvia> using same version of jquery and all?
22:16 < jtomasrl> how can i fix the "Origin http://localhost is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin." problem?
22:16 < geNAZt> set origin to *:* ?
22:17 < mgeary> lemme standardize
22:17 < jtomasrl> res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*"); ?
22:18 < CoverSlide> jtomasrl: tias
22:18 < CoverSlide> jtomasrl: i'm guessing that's on express
22:18 < jtomasrl> CoverSlide: restify
22:18 < CoverSlide> ok well i don't know restify's syntax but that seems reasonable
22:20 < jtomasrl> CoverSlide: i add it as a pre() function, it works for $.getJSON but not  for $.ajax
22:20 < CoverSlide> hm
22:20 < CoverSlide> uhh doesn't every jquery ajax function call $.ajax ?
22:22 < jtomasrl> CoverSlide: but set dataType to json, maybe that works
22:24 < jtomasrl> jsonp worked
22:24 < Tristan128> Hey. Can I pass a readable stream to express? Like res.send(readableStream) ?
22:26 < CoverSlide> Tristan128: no, but you can pipe streams
22:27 < Tristan128> like stream.pipe(res) ?
22:27 < CoverSlide> res and req are streams you can connect with pipes
22:27 < CoverSlide> yeah
22:27 < Tristan128> oh, awesome, thanks
22:31 < cellvia> mgeary im looking at flotr2 and it has no jquery or prototype / mootools dependency and can save to image
22:31 < cellvia> also the devs have built a realtime library that leverages it called envision
22:31 < mgeary> hmm
22:32 < cellvia> which may not be useful for you at this point, but anyways look at flotr2, it has a "download" method built right into it
22:32 < cellvia> that dumps a png or jpg
22:33 < cellvia> https://github.com/HumbleSoftware/Flotr2
22:33 < mgeary> maybe
22:33 < mgeary> no svg, though?
22:33 < cellvia> http://www.humblesoftware.com/flotr2/index#!download-image
22:34 <@konobi> oh, i remember that from a jsconf talk, iirc
22:34 < mgeary> ah, so that uses a canvas-based approach
22:34 < cellvia> yeah canvas
22:34 < mgeary> so yeah, it'd be pixels, not svg
22:34 < cellvia> pixels?
22:34 < mgeary> pulling the image data out
22:34 < cellvia> if youre putting it in a pdf why not use jpg / png
22:34 < mgeary> not necessarily a dealbreaker
22:34 < mgeary> yeah
22:34 < cellvia> seems easier 
22:34 < mgeary> maybe
22:34 < cellvia> than dealing with svg rendering probs
22:35 < cellvia> and inconsistencies
22:35 < cellvia> and jsdom >_<
22:35 < mgeary> true
22:35 < cellvia> konobi, which one, flotr2 or envision?
22:35 <@konobi> flotr
22:36 < cellvia> cool
22:36 <@konobi> though it was in relation to something else
22:36 < cellvia> yeah flotr is the graphing library im gravitating to
22:36 < cellvia> flotr2 rather
22:36 < cellvia> jquery dependency is lame
22:37 < cellvia> (highcharts)
22:37 < zomg> highcharts is nice because everyone uses jquery
22:37 < zomg> ;>
22:38 < cellvia> yeah...... until you want to render server side
22:38 < zomg> Easy, just run a headless webkit!
22:38 < zomg> Duuuh!
22:38 < cellvia> :)
22:38 < cellvia> tell it to mgeary
22:39 < mgeary> not rejecting that. do you have one you like?
22:39 < cellvia> im curious too
22:39 < cellvia> lets hear it
22:40 < zomg> I was joking
22:41 < cellvia> little do you know mgeary is ragged working on this very problem all day.  he may not have a sense of humor about it at this point
22:41 < mgeary> ~beat zomg senseless
22:41 < cellvia> lol
22:42 < zomg> Well if you're really into it, you could try phantomjs I guess
22:42 < zomg> We did some test automation using it and it seemed to work ok
22:42 < cellvia> it just seems backward to me
22:42 < zomg> But I don't know if you can use it for rendering
22:42 < mgeary> gonna try flotr at this point. Getting render/export problems with HC
22:42 < cellvia> when you can use flotr2 which alreayd has built in methods for doing this
22:42 < cellvia> and no dependencies
22:43 < mgeary> not bad
22:44 < mgeary> my data "just works" in flotr (in a browser)
22:44 < mgeary> so it should be easy to implement
22:45 < cellvia> yeah i think im gonna do the same thing
22:45 < myndzi> huh
22:45 < cellvia> im realizing that ppl may want to have like 8 diff charts on one page
22:45 < myndzi> what happened to hook.io?
22:45 < lostcaggy> hi I'm trying to send an Unsigned long from Arduino using udp to a node.js server I can read the four bytes using msg.readUInt32LE(0) but how do I convert back to the long 
22:45 < cellvia> and that will be slow on some computers with high charts client side
22:45 < cellvia> and a train wreck on mobile
22:46 < cellvia> the charts will only get more complex
22:46 < cellvia> i guess the unfortunate part is losing some element of interactivity
22:46 < cellvia> but i dont really need that for this purpose
22:55 < mekwall> https://gist.github.com/4458195 - I wonder why in/out totals haven't been added to net.server yet. Should be easier then that :)
22:56 <@konobi> mekwall: best done as a module probably
23:01 < mgeary> hey cellvia 
23:01 < cellvia> yeh
23:01 < mgeary> trying to get a reference to Flotr
23:01 < cellvia> i would use flotr2 personally
23:01 < cellvia> but what do you mean
23:01 < mgeary> i am
23:02 < mgeary> so, i include flotr2.min.js
23:02 < mgeary> just like i did highcharts.js
23:02 < mgeary> and with highcharts, i could get window.Highcharts
23:02 < mgeary> but with flotr2, window.Flotr is undefined
23:03 < cellvia> you shouldnt even be using that nodehighcharts implementation
23:03 < mgeary> i'm not
23:03 < cellvia> oh
23:03 < mgeary> i'm just using it as a reference, since i'm a node noob
23:03 < cellvia> ive never done that
23:03 < cellvia> i would make it into a module and require it
23:03 < cellvia> or just paste the min in your code
23:04 < mgeary> i'm game, but don't know how to make it a module
23:04 < cellvia> and if you have to use a window object ... i guess you could  create window.Flotr yourself
23:04 < mgeary> there aren't any full html examples of flotr2 that i can find
23:05 < cellvia> i dont understand what you mean by using it as a reference
23:06 < mgeary> http://dpaste.com/864030/
23:06 < mgeary> that's my view
23:06 < cellvia> yeah what im trying to say is dont use jsdom
23:06 < mgeary> i'm game for that, but don't know how to do that
23:06 < mgeary> mind offering some insights?
23:06 < cellvia> i havent done it before but you could use node-canvas
23:07 < cellvia> and see if flotr2 could just run with that
23:07 < cellvia> without jsdom at all
23:07 < cellvia> and just call the chart.download method
23:07 < cellvia> or whatever it is
23:07 < cellvia> from that link
23:07 < cellvia> http://www.humblesoftware.com/flotr2/index#!download-image
23:08 < cellvia> graph.download.saveImage(format);
23:08 < cellvia> i think as long as node-canvas works as a drop in for canvas
23:08 < cellvia> it should work
23:08 < mgeary> that's too many dots for me to connect, i'm afraid
23:10 < superjoe> what's more expensive according to CPU, a function call, or an if statement?
23:10 < joe-node0> function call
23:10 <@konobi> it depends
23:10 < cellvia> mgeary  it shouldnt be too hard.... but i cant guarantee that it works tho
23:10 < cellvia> mgeary i may mess with it soon i will look for you on here if i do
23:11 < cellvia> mgeary i just assume since it has no jquery dependency it will work easily server side
23:11 < mgeary> gah
23:11 < mgeary> i had a typo
23:11 < mgeary> Flotr is now an object
23:11 < joe-node0> superjoe: if the IF statement is crazy involved with many function calls inside of it then obviously it is not an efficient as a simple rudimentary function call that does just one thing.
23:12 < mgeary> hmm
23:12 < joe-node0> but if you're comparing a value to a variable vs making a function call, then I'd go with IF statement
23:12 < mgeary> else if (!el.clientWidth) throw 'The target container must be visible';
23:14 < superjoe> thanks
23:14 < superjoe> I suppose I should just benchmark it 
23:14 < joe-node0> never hurts
23:15 < cellvia> ahh damn
23:15 < cellvia> guess not so easy then
23:15 <@konobi> superjoe: depends what the VM and optimizer does with it
23:15 < ins0mnia> anyone knows if SockJS 0.3.5 supports heartbeat?
23:18 < mgeary> cellvia: it appears that the developers of flotr2 are saying it doesn't work in node… (?)
23:18 < cellvia> not as it is, unfortunately, youd have to modify the library
23:18 < cellvia> which i may attempt later but that could fall in your too many dots category
23:19 < jcrew> cellvia: are you trying to get an image out of it or just trying to produce a graph?
23:19 < MI6> joyent/node: Ben Noordhuis master * 5664dd2 : src: use static_cast where appropriate  Use static_cast instead of reinte - http://git.io/SvxK-g
23:19 < mgeary> bah
23:20 < bnoordhuis> tnorris: ^
23:21 < cellvia> jcrew, an image of a graph
23:21 < jcrew> would SVG output work?
23:21 < cellvia> sure
23:21 < jcrew> you could check out raphaeljs
23:21 < jcrew> graphaeljs is the graphing stuff: http://g.raphaeljs.com/
23:21 < cellvia> i didnt know about graphael
23:21 < tnorris> bnoordhuis: heh, thanks. and thanks for the review. can't believe how many trivial things I missed.
23:22 < cellvia> raphael works well server side?
23:22 < jcrew> someone in here got it working a few months ago in node, can't remember who
23:22 < CoverSlide> raphael works?
23:22 < cellvia> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6603250/raphael-js-server-side
23:22 < jcrew> someone got it working in a way they would process chart data to SVG output and send that to the browser
23:23 < cellvia> still uses phantom tho
23:23 < cellvia> but mgeary just needs something that works
23:24 < cellvia> mgeary did you already try this  https://github.com/travisghansen/highcharts-svg
23:25 < torvalamo> does it have to be svg?
23:25 < mgeary> torvalamo: no
23:25 < torvalamo> gd is pretty fast
23:25 < torvalamo> https://github.com/taggon/node-gd
23:25 < mgeary> torvalamo:  but that doesn't give me charting. i'd have to roll that manually
23:26 < cellvia> i guess phantom + highcharts could be the way to go after all as that previous person mentiond
23:27 < mgeary> well, i'm getting SVG from HC now
23:27 < mgeary> but it isn't rendering properly
23:28 < cellvia> right... but youre using a 2 yr old library
23:28 < mgeary> no
23:28 < mgeary> 2.3.5
23:28 < cellvia> i mean node-highcharts
23:28 < mgeary> not using node-highcharts
23:28 < cellvia> oh ok
23:28 < cellvia> just straight jsdom?
23:28 < cellvia> phantom might be better for this purpose tho
23:29 < cellvia> http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/wiki/QuickStart
23:29 < cellvia> it has a bunch of svg stuff
23:30 < samholmes> Anyone know of a good ip to location free REST service 
23:30 <@konobi> samholmes: nope, you can use GeoIP though
23:31 -!- mode/#Node.js [+o piscisaureus_] by ChanServ
23:31 < samholmes> konobi: What is GeoIP; a module?
23:31 <@konobi> yup
23:32 < cellvia> what is the module node uses for building dependency tree
23:32 < cellvia> er npm
23:32 < samholmes> I'll check that out. Thanks man. :)
23:33 <@konobi> so the svg strings are entirely different?
23:33 < mgeary> interesting
23:33 < mgeary> comparing the SVG from client & server
23:34 < mgeary> looks like the server doesn't know any heights, widths
23:34 < samholmes> konobi: know of any simple maps I could use with this geolocation data?
23:34 < cellvia> sounds like jsdom isnt emulating those props properly
23:34 < mgeary> maybe so
23:34 < robertj> can you yield/resume a vm sandbox?
23:34 <@konobi> samholmes: check the dtrace.org blogs for geoip and robinson projection
23:35 < mgeary> might also be why the creator of dali created a patched version of highcharts
23:35 < mgeary> sigh
23:35 < cellvia> yeah
23:35 < cellvia> i saw that too
23:35 < cellvia> phantomjs
23:35 < cellvia> worth a shot
23:35 < mgeary> maybe
23:35 < mgeary> sheesh
23:35 < cellvia> dont tell me you expected this to be easy ;)
23:37 <@konobi> can't you just set the height and width on the canvas element?
23:37 < Daegalus> random idea, anyone want DOTA2 on Steam? I just got 4 copies to give out
23:39 < cellvia> mgeary (a la kobobi recomendation)   when you do   new Highcharts.Chart({
23:39 < cellvia> can you manually enter the height and width
23:39 < cellvia> of the chart
23:40 < mgeary> yes, but it doesn't set the many NaN or 0 values
23:41 < mgeary> gonna try dali again
23:41 < cellvia> if that doesnt work do phantom it looks like it was built to actually output images
23:42 < mgeary> hmm. dali starts right up now
23:42 < mgeary> dare i hope...
23:42 <@konobi> highcharts-svg is built on phantom
23:42 < cellvia> true konobi but it also seems awkward, requiring a php script
23:43 < cellvia> but you could ref the sourcecode of how he did the node part
23:43 < tnorris> bnoordhuis: I only have a loose grasp on endian-ness and hardware. There is no such checks in the js buffer read implementations. is that automatically handled?
23:44 < cellvia> https://github.com/travisghansen/highcharts-svg/blob/master/javascript/chart.js
23:45 < bnoordhuis> tnorris: no, it just writes out the bytes in different order, depending on if isBigEndian is set
23:45 < mgeary> well
23:45 < mgeary> dali *almost* works
23:45 < mgeary> i get a good-looking chart
23:45 < mgeary> lines, legend, axes
23:45 < mgeary> … just no actual DATA
23:46 < mgeary> oh
23:46 < mgeary> oho 
23:46 <@konobi> the index.php is just writing stuff to a file and then calling phantomjs with the file path
23:46 < mgeary> the data is there, just not stroked/filled or somesuch
23:47 < mgeary> wow, i'm close
23:48 < woopwoop> anybody have experience with socket.io? http://pastebin.com/V6kB9zYb giving me info: socket.io started GET http://localhost:3000/socket.io/socket.io.js 404 (Not Found)  
23:48 < tnorris> bnoordhuis: hm. thought I placed the same type of logic. must be missing something. i'll go back and check.
23:49 < cellvia> konobi yeah... i would reference highcharts-svg but im not interested in having a php script do this
23:49  * mgeary has achieved server side chart generation!!
23:49 < cellvia> yeah? outputting properly?
23:50 < mgeary> yeap
23:50 < cellvia> sweet man
23:50 < cellvia> try a diff one
23:50 < cellvia> from the examples
23:50 < mgeary> it's not 100% what i want, since dali is still set up to be a server with a client
23:50 < bnoordhuis> tnorris: you need to swizzle iff the requested endianness is different from the host's endianness
23:50 < bnoordhuis> tnorris: so if you're on a LE machine and isBigEndian==true, swizzle
23:51 < bnoordhuis> tnorris: but if it's a BE machine, _don't_ swizzle
23:51 < tnorris> bnoordhuis: ah, and that's for both read/write?
23:51 < bnoordhuis> tnorris: yes
23:51 < cellvia> mgeary let me know i it works with other examples
23:52 < tnorris> cool. think I can handle that.
23:52 < bnoordhuis> tnorris: but frankly, the easiest way to deal with that is to simply write out the bytes one by one
23:52 < bnoordhuis> tnorris: that is however kind of tricky with floating point numbers
23:53 < bnoordhuis> tnorris: with integral types, you simply do ((val >> 24) & 255) and you have a single byte
23:53 < bnoordhuis> but that doesn't work with floats or doubles, of course
23:53 < tnorris> so is using memcpy the best option?
23:54 < bnoordhuis> maybe. its disadvantage is that you need to know the endianness of the machine you're running on
23:57 < tnorris> bnoordhuis: would it work to add an `#define AC_C_BIGENDIAN` and toggle the `big_endian` argument?
23:57 < bnoordhuis> tnorris: how are you going to know what the define should be set to?
23:57 < andrewaclt> Is there a particular JS MVC framework that plays well with socket.io apps?
23:57 < andrewaclt> ...mainly on the client side
23:59 < tjfontaine> bnoordhuis: rely on pythons answer?
23:59 < bnoordhuis> tjfontaine: unreliable when cross-compiling
