00:25 < tonyk> is anyone here a writer (or knows a writer) who writes for a high traffic blog or news website?
00:49 < stan_man_can> Anyone here used Pubnub
00:49 < stan_man_can> ?
01:17 < monokrome> :D
01:21 < monokrome> Are there issues with nodejs on x86_64?
01:29 < monokrome> Is there are reason why Node's make process looks for /usr/bin/python instead of /usr/bin/python2?
01:31 < monokrome> (The process also doesn't work in Py3, which causes systems like ArchLinux to fail building node)
01:33 < monokrome> you could also use /usr/bin/env python to be a little bit better about it
01:33 < monokrome> (IE, to get it to pass the first bit of building I symlinked python2 into ./bin because ./bin is the first item in my PATH)
01:34 < monokrome> but later in the process, it didn't use /usr/bin/env
01:34 < monokrome> and failed
02:13 < utu> I found out about redis, some kind of key-value pair module that stores data in mem....I'm trying to use to track a list of active users, I'm mapping 'username' to 'status', bascially i'm using set
02:13 < utu> I was wondering how could I then list out all active users?
02:13 < utu> using this module: https://github.com/mranney/node_redis
02:17 < chapel> utu, well you could store the username/status in sets
02:17 < chapel> or a set
02:17 < chapel> and use smembers to get them out
02:25 < octane--> is there a way to do an npm update dry run?
02:26 < TooTallNate> wow
02:26 < TooTallNate> inflight wifi
02:26 < TooTallNate> this is a first for me :)
02:27 < tim_smart> Inflight wifi must be extremely helpful, especially if was an international flight
02:28 < TooTallNate> tim_smart: lol, only 1 hour 20 minutes :p
02:28 < TooTallNate> still worth the $5
02:28 < tim_smart> Heh, it is a 10+ hour flight to the bay area from NZ

03:05 < blackxored> hello guys
03:05 < shiftpgdn> hi
03:05 < blackxored> I was wondering
03:05 < blackxored> if you were to name 5 must-to feeds for node.js what would they be?
03:05 < blackxored> s/they/them
03:08 < blackxored> can't you come up with 5 sites
03:08 < blackxored> ??
03:08 < blackxored> like in: howtonode, nodejitsu, node.js blog, nodetuts
03:09 < blackxored> ...
03:13 < mburst> blackxored, tutsplus has some good posts tagged for node
03:15 < fmarier> is there a way to limit the size of the body that will be returned by an http.ClientRequest?
03:16 < fmarier> i tried keeping track of the total chunk length seen so far in the 'data' event of the ClientResponse object, but the memory usage of my node process is still in the multi-megabytes, so it looks like it's reading in the whole body somewhere...
03:20 < TooTallNate> fmarier: connect's limit() middleware was designed specifically for that
03:20 < TooTallNate> though actually, that's for a Server. not sure how well it would apply to a Client request...
03:22 < octane--> does anyone here use uglify as a compiler?
03:38 < zloyded> hi all
03:39 < zloyded> o, asleep?
03:43 < zloyded> O:-)
04:10 < shiftpgdn> usercount.pl
04:10 < shiftpgdn> whoops
04:11 < chanced> ugh, just found path
04:11 < chanced> that woulda saved me a lot of typing
04:11 < chanced> sob
04:31 < Jakey> whos the original author of node-irc
05:20 < owen1> how to deal with a db connection and node? should i open the connection on each request to my website (assuming the request needs data from my db) or is it possible to open a connection once and use it for all the requests?
05:34 < munichlinux> owen1, IMO connections will have timeout. Its a good pratice to tear up and tear down the connection whenever you need it. 
05:38 < owen1> munichlinux: so on each request i should open it and close it when done.
05:38 < owen1> i just hope it will not be too slow
05:38 < zomg> I don't think that's necssarily a good idea
05:39 < zomg> I don't think SQL servers really have a very large connection pool by default so the better solution is generally sharing the connection
05:39 < zomg> but I guess it depends
05:39 < zomg> I've only used MongoDB with a node app and I never close the connection and it works just fine
05:39 < owen1> zomg: i use mongodb, bwt
05:39 < owen1> btw
05:40 < zomg> Yeah, keeping the connection open forever seems to work just fine with mongo
05:41 < owen1> zomg: how do u organize your db related functions? do u have models folder and inside a file per collection?
05:41 < zomg> Yeah pretty much
05:41 < zomg> I'm using Mongoose
05:41 < owen1> if you have a project with mongo sample, would u mind sharing it?
05:41 < owen1> and where do u put the opening connection code? seperate file inside models folder?
05:41 < zomg> What I do is pretty similar to how mongoose docs shows it, nothing special really
05:42 < zomg> I have it in my application initialization code
05:42 < owen1> zomg: is it part of your server.js file?
05:43 < zomg> Yeah
05:44 < owen1> also, what the reason u use mongoose and not the 10gen module? https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/
05:45 < owen1> zomg: ^
05:46 < zomg> Mongoose is a bit higher level
05:46 < zomg> Allows you to define "models" by defining what fields, validations and such are in them
05:47 < zomg> And other things like that
05:47 < zomg> I think it uses mongodb-native under the hood though
05:51 < owen1> zomg: nice. not sure if i need all that stuff, but good to know i have the option if i need validations, etc
06:59 < eddyb> chjj: so I took a look again at your term.js and I think I can make it so that it doesn't always have a focused terminal
07:29 < Karmaon> MongoDB is WEB SCALE.
07:29 < Karmaon> WEB & SCALE.
07:29 < Karmaon> Those two words go together as if they were opposite sides of a magnet!
07:30 < Karmaon> And I'm a unicorn!
07:30 < Ezku> I guess monopoles are true, after all.
07:32 < Karmaon> I'm butthurt the rdbms support is sub-optimal for new technologies such as node.
07:34 < [AD]Turbo> hola
07:36 < pancake> express not working on node 0.8?
07:45 < tilleps> express works fine for me in node 0.8
07:45 < tilleps> as does socket.io
09:10 < Piotras> hi, anyone experienced with node-gyp ?
10:54 < strk> is there a way to prevent "npm install" from replacing symlinks already in place under node_modules ?
10:54 < strk> ie: only install what's missing..
11:09 < Glenjamin> hi guys, the newest version of npm seems to be making my /node_modules/.bin/* symlinks as absolute paths, rather than relative paths
11:09 < Glenjamin> i'm wondering if this was intentional, and why?
11:31 < strk> oh, I was wrong, it doesn't replace them, unless "invalid" as per required version
11:45 < deoxxa> so, i'm playing with appjs
11:45 < deoxxa> seems very broken
11:47 < ebright> hi - I'm trying to access my local node.js webserver via the internet. I've setup port forwarding on my modem & wifi router, but still no luck.
11:49 < ebright> do I have to configure my node app at all to make it available?
12:03 < Jakey> this channel is pretty much dead
12:05 < sriley> ebright: when you tell node to listen for connections you can also specify an ip address, make sure you havent
12:06 < sriley> http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_server_listen_port_hostname_backlog_callback
12:07 < ebright> sriley like this app.listen(3000); right?
12:07 < sriley> yes
12:08 < sriley> the hostname is optional and make its only listen to connections from that host so if you specify 127.0.0.1 itll only allow connections from your local machine
12:10 < ebright> Thanks sriley, doesn't appear to be the cause though. I already had it setup without an ip address (as shown)
12:11 < sriley> in that case firewall blocking the connection?
12:21 < deoxxa> Jakey: are you the same Jakey that used to hang around hpavc?
12:23 < Jakey> deoxxa your nick is familiar too
12:23 < Jakey> but no
12:23 < Jakey> probably someone was spoofing as me
12:24 < Jakey> what did he do
12:24 < deoxxa> can't remember, was years ago now
12:24 < deoxxa> but you're australian, right?
12:24 < Jakey> nope
12:24 < deoxxa> oh, my mistake then
12:24 < deoxxa> ha
12:24 < Glenjamin> isaacs: are you about? was the change to .bin symlinks to make them absolute paths intentional?
12:25 < Jakey> but your nick is so familiar deoxxa
12:25 < Jakey> what ther network u on
12:25 < deoxxa> just here and a small network for a 2600 meeting group
12:26 < deoxxa> used to be on rizon and stuff as well, but don't have a reason to be there anymore
12:31 < Jakey> ah yess
12:31 < Jakey> i knew i seen this nick from somewhere
12:32 < Jakey> hmm....
13:01 < ullmark> Hi, How can I check whether a request is http or https?
13:03 < strk> how do I clear the npm cache ?
13:03 < strk> Error: No compatible version found: tilelive-mapnik@'>=0.4.1- <0.5.0-' \n Valid install targets: ["0.0.1"]
13:03 < Delapouite> npm cache clear
13:03 < strk> but npm view tilelive-mapnik shows a lot
13:04 < strk> Delapouite: thanks -- unfortunately it didn't fix the issue, I'm wondering what's the deal. Maybe "engine" requirement not met for other versions ?
13:06 < Delapouite> npm cache clean sorry
13:22 < strk> npm ls -g | grep jshint
13:22 < strk> ├─┬ jshint@0.7.1
13:22 < strk> then why does "npm install" within a module warns about:
13:22 < strk> npm WARN prefer global jshint@0.7.1 should be installed with -g
13:22 < strk> I mean, why doesn't "npm install" just use the one installed globally ?
13:23 < strk> or, is there a way to tell it so ?
14:01 < Bonuspunk> strk i'm guessing you should install jshint global so you can use the command line "jshint <file>"
14:22 < iuhiz> hey guys, i was just reading http://book.mixu.net/ch3.html and i'm wondering if there's any downsides to keeping client requests open and storing the response object in an array when implementing long polling with node?
14:23 < bradleymeck> you can leak the heck out of memory unless you remove requests as appropriate
14:23 < iuhiz> so how should i go about removing requests?
14:24 < bradleymeck> well when the request is no longer going to be used, remove it from the array, and limit maximum number of stored requests to prevent an accidental DDOS
14:25 < bradleymeck> or get a big enough server so DDOS is unlikely from concurrent memory usage
14:29 < iuhiz> awesome, thanks for the tip on accidental DDOS
14:32 < jhsto> hey guys, how do i update node?
14:33 < creationix> jhsto: what OS?
14:33 < jhsto> centos
14:33 < creationix> and do you want multiple versions?
14:33 < jhsto> no, just the new one
14:33 < jhsto> 0.8 or what it is
14:33 < creationix> did you install from source or using some package manager
14:34 < jhsto> i installed it as it said on github
14:34 < jhsto> wait ill check what it was
14:34 < creationix> if from source, just download the latest tarball http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.8.1/node-v0.8.1.tar.gz and ./configure && make && make install
14:34 < creationix> that will install over the old one
14:35 < creationix> of clone the git repo and checkout to the 0.8.1 tag
14:35 < jhsto> it was with package manager
14:35 < creationix> then you'll have to wait till your package manager updates their version
14:35 < creationix> personally I just install from source on Linux
14:36 < creationix> and manage multiple versions with nvm
14:36 < creationix> (nvm is a simple bash function that tweaks PATH and builds node with a custom PREFIX)
14:36 < jhsto> ok
14:36 < jhsto> thank you for your help
14:36 < jhsto> ill keep mind on that nvm
14:36 < creationix> no problem, good luck
14:36 < jhsto> Any idea was there good improvements in terms of http requesting?
14:37 < jhsto> Like I have this app which makes a lot of API calls and I wonder should I upgrade it.
14:41 < creationix> jhsto: did you see https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/API-changes-between-v0.6-and-v0.8 ?
14:43 < jhsto> creationix, no i did not
14:43 < jhsto> thank you
14:47 < milani> hey, does this code runs async?  (function() { var bar = " World"; alert(foo + bar); })();
14:49 < creationix> milani: no
14:50 < creationix> and alert() blocks
14:51 < bradleymeck> for(;;)alert('no hope')
14:51 < creationix> bradleymeck: that's just mean
14:51 < bradleymeck> in some ways i miss that evil
14:52 < creationix> I remember on older browsers that would hijack the ui 
14:52 < bradleymeck> newer browsers know whats going on and prompt you after 3-5 popups
14:52 < bradleymeck> yea, it would and you had to forcequit
14:52 < pifantastic> it's worse when you did it to yourself trying to debug something in a loop
14:52 < bradleymeck> +1 for anyone who adds `alert = console.log`
14:53 < pifantastic> you have to be a bit more creative
14:53 < pifantastic> that won't work as is
14:53 < jhsto> does console log block?
14:53 < christophsturm> with the new cluster api is it possible to redeploy a master without downtime?
14:53 < creationix> jhsto: if it does, it's not for long
14:53 < bradleymeck> yes, but it wont do full inspection
14:54 < creationix> it just logs to an internal array somewhere
14:54 < jhsto> ok thats good to hear
14:54 < bradleymeck> christophsturm: no, use a .fork approach
14:55 < bradleymeck> creationix: is there a reason we don't have a multitenancy deploy system for updates in open source?
14:55 < bradleymeck> mt
14:56 < christophsturm> bradleymeck: do you have example code for that?
14:56 < bradleymeck> not on hand
14:57 < jhsto> can someone nice check if this is asynchronous: https://gist.github.com/3033645
14:57 < jhsto> or any ideas to improve it
14:58 < bradleymeck> basically make a "master" that registers workers (the thing to update), and rotate them as needed
14:59 < Glenjamin> bradleymeck: imo that belongs outside the application
14:59 < bradleymeck> Glenjamin: could be a separate app management app
14:59 < Glenjamin> not against that
15:00 < bradleymeck> but i just havent written one
15:00 < Glenjamin> do you expose node directly to the outside world?
15:00 < Glenjamin> it kinda feels like its far easier to do that in the load balancer
15:00 < bradleymeck> directly?
15:00 < bradleymeck> even with load balancing sometimes we have clients that are bount to specific IPs and their apps do not like load balancing
15:00 < bradleymeck> .remoteAddress problem :/
15:01 < bradleymeck> bound*
15:02 < jhsto> can someone tip me how to bind a socket.io event to a button?
15:09 < ralphholzmann> after upgrading to v0.8.1, I can no longer ctrl+c to kill my http server
15:09 < ralphholzmann> frustrating as hell :(
15:11 < bradleymeck> ralphholzmann: ctrl+d or ctrl+z ?
15:11 < bradleymeck> ctrl+d is pref since it wont nuke background jobs
15:12 < ralphholzmann> no response from any of them :/
15:12 < ralphholzmann> trying to reduce to a test case now
15:15 < jfroma> i think this is a nice opensource editor to work in node: http://ninja-ide.org/ (but i am still in sublime)
15:19 < Deathspike> I'm using Express and Mongoose and have an error in Mongoose, and want Express to use its error handler and handle it. How should I go about? Throwing the Mongoose error just exits the server and won't get caught as Express error.
15:20 < jryans> npm signup page gives me: "There was a problem! The server said: not_found"
15:20 < owen1> nodeconf starts today. anyone know if they plan to stream it live or if the videos will be available or what topics are presented?
15:21 < KiNgMaR> bnoordhuis, you around? something seems off with node-iconv 1.2.0 and iconv > http://dpaste.de/IKAdT/
15:22 < bnoordhuis> KiNgMaR: here
15:23 < KiNgMaR> any ideas on what might be going on? looks like it may be related to the change to gyp?
15:24 < ralphholzmann> bradleymeck: narrowed it down to a 0.6.x module, false alarm
15:24 < bnoordhuis> KiNgMaR: oh, that probably means your glibc doesn't export locale_charset()
15:24 < bnoordhuis> KiNgMaR: can you open an issue? it's probably trivial to resolve
15:25 < KiNgMaR> sure :)
15:25 < bnoordhuis> for something completely different, all you gnome/gtk users in here do `mkdir -p $HOME/.config/ibus/bus` now
15:25 < bnoordhuis> i just discovered why my battery life was so poor
15:26 < NodeX> Apple MAC ? lolol
15:26 < bnoordhuis> if you don't have that directory, *every* gtk app wakes up *every* second to poll
15:26 < bnoordhuis> i am not amused >:-(
15:27 < bnoordhuis> i guess i should report it to ubuntu
15:27 < bradleymeck> owen1: from what I heard no live stream, but videos will be up sometime idk when, prolly not until after the conf
15:31 < Jakey> heyhey
15:31 < Jakey> if you run node.js
15:31 < Jakey> how do you quit out of it
15:31 < skylamer`> ctrl+c
15:31 < owen1> bradleymeck: thanks
15:31 < owen1> bradleymeck: is there an irc chat or anything?
15:32 < Jakey> skylamer` did you get the job?
15:33 < skylamer`> he's not writing yet
15:34 < Jakey> k
15:34 < Jakey> so..
15:34 < Jakey> without using npm
15:34 < Jakey> can i just drag the files to node_modules and will it just works/
15:34 < Jakey> ?
15:35 < skylamer`> there can be in the same dir also, or with a folder with name of the module
15:35 < skylamer`> yes
15:35 < skylamer`> u can check with commands liken
15:35 < skylamer`> npm ls
15:35 < skylamer`> npm bin, npm root
15:36 < Jakey> well i said without the npm
15:36 < Jakey> incase i lost internet connection
15:36 < skylamer`> isnt npm just packed with node.js recently
15:36 < skylamer`> yes u can
16:01 < adalgiso> crapbuster
16:10 < game16> Hi, anyone here used jsdom before? I can't figure out a way to get jQuery to attach event handlers to my svgs that I generate server side
16:15 < Deathspike> Is anyone familiar with Mongoose here? I have a simple model with an unique index, but I can add duplicates without any issues. This is the model, http://pastebin.com/FVB08JPA.
16:16 < shanse> there's a seperate channel for mongoose
16:17 < Deathspike> Which channel is that?
16:17 < shanse> #mongoosejs
16:18 < Deathspike> thanks
16:19 < shanse> you're welcome
16:28 < jocafa> kindof offtopic, but does anyone have a good way to do web-based presentations where people can follow along in a browser?
16:30 < jetienne> jocafa: google plus hangout
16:30 < crewmoss> jocafa: depending on what you'd need google docs is great.
16:30 < jetienne> jocafa: or google presentation 
16:30 < crewmoss> That's what I use all the time.
16:30 < jocafa> will a google presentation keep everyone on the same slide or what?
16:30 < crewmoss> Yup
16:30 < jetienne> with a chat room :_
16:30 < crewmoss> Everything is synced
16:30 < jocafa> i don't actually need video chat or anything. i just need people to be able to follow along in the same room
16:31 < jetienne> google presentation is the way to go
16:31 < crewmoss> Yeah, then Google Presentation should work great.
16:34 < crewmoss> jetienne: have you ever used the http://slides.html5rocks.com/ project?
16:35 < jetienne> http://html5slides.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/template/index.html#1 crewmoss i use those one
16:35 < jetienne> http://jeromeetienne.github.com/slides/tquery.webglcamp/#1 with a modification to support offline and writing slides in markdown
16:36 < jetienne> no sync tho
16:36 < crewmoss> Right, but still useful... depending on what you need.
16:36 < crewmoss> The html5rocks one has some nice things like notes, etc
16:37 < crewmoss> And toc
16:37 < Raynos> I've got a module that reads process.env
16:37 < Raynos> I want to require this module multiple times with different envs and then assert something about it
16:37 < Raynos> other then clearing require cache what's the best way to do this
16:38 < jetienne> crewmoss: nice
16:50 < TheFuzzball> I'm trying to install node-sqlite3 via npm on OS X Mountain Lion and the build fails - http://pastie.org/4188235
16:50 < TheFuzzball> Anyone seen "make: c++: No such file or directory" before?
16:53 < s5fs> TheFuzzball: sounds like maybe you don't have a c++ compiler?
16:54 < TheFuzzball> `which g++` = /usr/bin/g++
16:54 < bnoordhuis> TheFuzzball: what does `which c++` say?
16:55 < s5fs> I don't run osx so I've never seen that before. Maybe you could hack it by creating a symlink from c++ -> g++, but ymmv.
16:55 < TheFuzzball> bnoordhuis c++ has never been a compiler name
16:55 < s5fs> However, I don't know why it's preferring c++ over g++, maybe you need to pass configure an arg or something. I'd look thru the config script.
16:56 < bnoordhuis> TheFuzzball: is too :)
16:56 < bnoordhuis> TheFuzzball: $ which c++
16:56 < bnoordhuis> /usr/bin/c++
16:56 < lohkey> Xcode apparently recently swapped out the GCC frontend to LLVM with clang
16:56 < TheFuzzball> bnoordhuis ls -al /usr/bin/c++?
16:56 < lohkey> pretty cool, but also pretty annoying imo
16:57 < bnoordhuis> TheFuzzball: it's a symlink to g++
16:57 < bnoordhuis> (of course)
16:57 < lohkey> it's a legacy posix thing
16:57 < lohkey> like how cc is typically a symlink to gcc
16:58 < TheFuzzball> hmm.. lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  7 27 Jun 02:33 /usr/bin/c++ -> clang++
16:58 < TheFuzzball> So it does exist.
16:58 < s5fs> the symlink does, but does clang++ exist too?
17:00 < TheFuzzball> Oh, that's interesting… I changed from /usr/bin/c++ from /usr/bin/clang++ to /usr/bin/llvm-g++ and it worked.
17:01 < TheFuzzball> It mustn't like compiling with clang
17:01 < s5fs> good to go!
17:01 < TheFuzzball> Should be :)
17:01 < TheFuzzball> Thanks guys
17:01 < s5fs> Thank you for flying node.js!
17:08 < staar2> hello
17:20 < Deathspike> I'd like to get some feedback; I wrote a simple REST-service on Express and Mongoose. The code is here http://pastebin.com/zaGzpbXs. Has anyone got any suggestions for readability, functionality, behaviour, etc? Any feedback is appreciated, I'm rather new to this.
17:21 < staar2> is there some sublime2 comment snippet plugin ?
17:25 < substack> beep boop

17:33 <@maxogden> im in the crowd 
17:34 < other_guy> I'm stuck in my office in N Portland, but I'm hoping to come by the conference tomorrow.
17:34 < other_guy> I don't have a ticket sadly.
17:34 < other_guy> Perhaps one of you miscreants will vouch for me?
17:34 < other_guy> I have a bucket that isaacs demanded for a demonstration tomorrow, Nexxy gave it to me.
17:34 <@maxogden> its mega full, no more seats available
17:35 < skylamer`> bucket of chicken?
17:35 < other_guy> I'm just going to hang from the ceiling inconspicuously… except for my pants will be down, but I expect that won't be distracting.
17:35 < diegoviola> i don't like js
17:35 < staar2> no live stream ?
17:35 < Jakey> skylamer` something like this? http://imgur.com/gallery/N46uX
17:36 < skylamer`> :D
17:36 < other_guy> diegoviola, that's a crazy coincidence.  JS was just in here like 5 minutes ago talking shit about you.
17:36 < skylamer`> close, 
17:36 < diegoviola> other_guy: heh
17:36 < jocafa> yeah is there a live stream anywhere?
17:37 < diegoviola> other_guy: send him my regards
17:37 < Jakey> i don't like diegoviola because he don't like JS
17:37 < jocafa> for those of us that are bolted to our current location by having families? :P
17:37 < other_guy> jocafa, just sell them on the open market.  That'll cover your travel expenses too!
17:38 < jocafa> i'd have to sell them as irregular units :(
17:38 < skylamer`> !beer skylamer`
17:39 < other_guy> jocafa, that's not a problem… haven't you been to the outlet malls lately?  People go crazy for that stuff.
17:39 < jocafa> you have a good point
17:43 < s5fs> i'm in portland too, also without ticket. where are you guys boozing it up after the conference, where's the meetups at?
17:43 <@Nexxy> other_guy lol
17:43 < wookiehangover> maxogden: that's a beautiful horse
17:43 < s5fs> Nexxy: hey!
17:43 <@Nexxy> haiii!
17:44 < s5fs> Nexxy: hows the conf, having fun? i hadda be in the office at 6:45a, can you b'leeve it?
17:44 <@Nexxy> Jupiter hotel slash doug fir
17:44 <@Nexxy> ew.
17:44 < bnoordhuis> everyone's at nodeconf?
17:44 < other_guy> I assume you guys are going to be slumming it on the inner east side after the conf is done?
17:45 < s5fs> Nexxy: you getting much hang time when the conf gets out? text me and i'll head over, i'm free after 3p today 
17:45 < mmalecki> bnoordhuis: I'm not!
17:45 < s5fs> other_guy: watch it, some of us live in inner east side, haha!
17:45 < bnoordhuis> mmalecki: well, me neither :)
17:45 <@Nexxy> hahaha
17:45 < s5fs> bnoordhuis: no, couldn't afford a ticket. i'll just be sitting outside looking sad.
17:45 < mmalecki> bnoordhuis: meet up in Amsterdam? nodeconf.amsterdam!
17:46 < bnoordhuis> mmalecki: i would like that actually :)
17:46 < bnoordhuis> mmalecki: nodeconf.eu is in portugal which is just far away enough to not be attractive
17:46 < mmalecki> bnoordhuis: hm, well, we *could* make that happen
17:46 < other_guy> s5fs, no hard feelings, I'm moving from the West side over to the East side at the end of the summer.
17:46 < bnoordhuis> mmalecki: you have my full support!
17:47 < s5fs> other_guy: makes sense, thats where all the best breakfast joints are
17:47 < other_guy> The noise downtown has finally gotten to me, and the highrise buildings are nice, but too expensive, and when you're far enough above the street all you see is the ugly ass tops of buildings with their drainage and HVAC systems below you.
17:47 < s5fs> other_guy: great location if you're deaf and love hvac
17:48 < other_guy> Yeah I'm right on the South Park blocks now, so I look out at trees and grass from my 2nd story bay window… that's going to be hard to beat.
17:48 < other_guy> but it's time to move. :-/
17:49 < s5fs> anywhere below 39th and south of burnside (but north of powell) is a winner imho
17:50 < other_guy> s5fs, if I had my druthers I'd move to the Irvington neighborhood, but it's crazy expensive
17:52 < s5fs> i too like the irvington, if i ever find $2500/mo for rent i'd consider it
17:52 < other_guy> :-)
17:52 < other_guy> WTF do all those people in that neighborhood do for a living.
17:52 < other_guy> ?
17:52 < s5fs> realtors ;-)
17:52 < othiym23> inherit their houses from their parents
17:52 < bazookatooth> must be new realtors
17:52 < other_guy> It's like several square miles of million $$$ homes
17:53 < s5fs> they weren't that expensive 10yrs ago, not even close
17:53 < other_guy> and Alameda is the same way just north
17:53 < s5fs> ugh, keep heading north and you have 600k homes and lots of street crime, best of both worlds?
17:54 < other_guy> s5fs, yeah on the edge of Alberta and Killingsworth area… it's nuts
17:54 < other_guy> A buddy of mine at Gigapan lives up there
17:54 < s5fs> i grew up off lombard & interstate, that areas changed a lot too
17:55 < other_guy> Yeah, I grew up in Milwaukie… I never would have thought in a million years that I'd have an office on N Mississippi… unless I'd made some really, really bad decisions in life :-)
17:57 < s5fs> haha! my buddy lived in the worst crack apartments i'd ever seen, over near the crowbar. just crazy.
18:01 < other_guy> Well if you guys end up going out after the conference I'd definitely be down for some Portland distilled spirits, Nexxy has my number, but in case anyone else wants to give a shout.  509.290.2526
18:01 < kenperkins> im so jealous of nhibernate. I wish someone ported it to node
18:06 < other_guy> kenperkins, I'm working on a model layer for Riak that works on top of the js pure version of Riak-js that has some handy features like easily handling conceptual objects that are actually comprised of multiple riak objects
18:09 <@Nexxy> hoi
18:10 < bnoordhuis> kenperkins: ORMs are a blight and will go first against the wall when the revolution comes
18:10 < bazookatooth> heh.
18:12 < other_guy> bnoordhuis, most of the trouble with them is that everybody takes their cues from ActiveRecord anymore.  Hardly anyone does anything interesting when they build them out.
18:22 < othiym23> one of my missions at NodeConf is to figure out why there are *so many* ORMs for *Redis*
18:22 < othiym23> what the heck is that all about?
18:23 < possibilities> trying to add tests to a command line node app that makes tons of changes to the filesystem. can anyone point me to a project(s) i should be learning from?
18:23 < chapel> othiym23: there are a lot of orms for redis?
18:26 < kenperkins> bnoordhuis: having spent ~6 years working on an app that has tables/sprocs/functions/data layer/classes all explicitly defined, I'm happy to disagree with you :)
18:26 < bnoordhuis> kenperkins: you're free to disagree with me
18:26 < bnoordhuis> but only when you're wrong >:-)
18:26 < kenperkins> heh
18:27 < bnoordhuis> kenperkins: i'm approaching it from the other side. i've had to patch up too many hibernate (not nhibernate) apps to have any love left for ORMs
18:27 < kenperkins> :S
18:27 < kenperkins> patch meaning work around the limitations of the ORM
18:28 < bnoordhuis> yes
18:28 < bnoordhuis> of which there are many
18:28 < kenperkins> I hear you
18:28 < bnoordhuis> gavin king prays he'll never run into me IRL
18:28 < kenperkins> I recognize that when your model falls outside of the design of the system you have some challenges
18:28 < kenperkins> but for some apps that are pretty straightforward, it can be a godsend
18:29 < bnoordhuis> even then
18:29 < bnoordhuis> an example of how ORMs break down on even trivial cases
18:29 < bnoordhuis> there was (and maybe still is) a bug in hibernate where it fails to serialize/deserialize plain integers in sets
18:30 < bnoordhuis> it's a known bug and, last i checked, it had been around for four years and still wasn't fixed
18:30 < kenperkins> meaning x: [1,2,3,4,5] ?
18:30 < bnoordhuis> yeah, kind of
18:30 < othiym23> chapel: there are more than 2, which is more than 2 too many
18:30 < staar2> what would be good documentation style in JS, currently I use Java javadoc style ?
18:31 < othiym23> staar2: check out JSDOC or YUIDoc
18:31 < othiym23> staar2: short version, you're on the right path
18:32 < othiym23> staar2: for an alternative path, you can check out docco: http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/
18:32 < kenperkins> coming from my app that would require ~7 changes to 7 different files to add a single property to a model, I'm happy to work with the limitations
18:32 < rinon> hi all, I'm trying to use npm with the most recent git of node, and it doesn't seem to play nice. any way to install npm with "0.9.0-pre"?
18:32 < RLa> othiym23, have they solved block comment issue yet?
18:35 < othiym23> RLa: no idea! :D
18:35 < othiym23> so apparently yesterday was isaacs's birthday
18:35 < othiym23> so there's that
18:35 < othiym23> there may have been some Happy Birthdays here at nodeconf
18:37 < qbit_> anyone start getting "npm ERR! 404 'registry' is not in the npm registry." on private npm repos ? 
18:39 < __taco> howdy!
18:39 < rinon> so... is there any way to make npm work with the most recent dev version of node?
18:40 <@maxogden> __taco: i approve of your irc nickname
18:44 < qbit_> this is on couch 1.1.1 
18:44 < bnoordhuis> rinon: the most recent dev version of node bundles npm...
18:45 < bnoordhuis> rinon: did you mean to ask "how do i install npm packages with the dev version of node"?
18:45 < rinon> hm.... I'll have to go dig it up then, didn't get installed into my $PATH
18:45 < bnoordhuis> rinon: npm gets installed into $PREFIX/bin -- where PREFIX=/usr/local if you didn't pass --prefix to configure
18:45 < rinon> I get "Error: npm doesn't work with node v0.9.0-pre"
18:46 < rinon> I guess that is the npm that was bundled with node, but it's not happy
18:46 < bnoordhuis> rinon: let me check that
18:46 < rinon> bnoordhuis: thanks for the help :)
18:48 < bnoordhuis> rinon: by damn
18:48 < bnoordhuis> Error: npm doesn't work with node v0.9.0-pre
18:48 < bnoordhuis> Required: node@0.6 || 0.7 || 0.8
18:48 < bnoordhuis> i'll open an issue and look into it
18:48 < bnoordhuis> personally, i blame isaacs
18:48 < rinon> bnoordhuis: thanks, I saw an issue reported in some mailing list, but there were no replies
18:49 < skylamer`> When Streams Live??? : )
18:50 < ecomode> hi
18:51 < bnoordhuis> rinon: https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/3616
18:51 < ecomode> is node something you implement in html like php?
18:51 < rinon> bnoordhuis: thanks!
18:51 < bnoordhuis> ecomode: no. not even close
18:51 < bnoordhuis> rinon: my pleasure :) thanks for bringing it up
18:52 < skylamer`> ecomode , but u can
18:54 < ecomode> so what's the main purpose of node?
18:54 <@maxogden> big data
18:54 < zutto> ecomode: whats the main purpose of any programming language?
18:54 < othiym23> gettin paid
18:54 < zutto> :|
18:55 < bnoordhuis> ecomode: job security
18:55 < othiym23> time for tacos
18:55 < bnoordhuis> nobody but yourself will be able to understand the callback spaghetti
18:55 < zutto> i personally use node to cook me breakfast every morning
18:56 < ecomode> zutto: well I guess you don't programm photo editing software with php right?...
18:56 < zutto> no, but other people have done that
18:57 < ecomode> bnoordhuis: in what way? will it replace something on the long term?
18:57 < zutto> php with imagemagik can do quite alot
18:57 < bnoordhuis> ecomode: i wasn't being serious. many people think we're after rails but that's not quite it
18:59 < kenperkins> I know lots of people prefer node for asynchronous heavy projects (realtime this or that), but I love node simply because of the ease of working in Js on the client and server. having the server be event based is icing.
19:00 < bradleymeck> kenperkins: indeed i do most my shell scripting in it now XD
19:02 < kenperkins> bradleymeck: Ditto, except that I write the logic as a module so I can integrate it into my admin UI as well
19:19 < dob_> Can somebody help me with some problems with mongoose-auth? Or will I have to switch the channel?
19:21 < mattkime> does anyone know how to start, and more importantly, stop a specific service
19:21 < mattkime> er process
19:22 < lpin> guys take a look at this
19:22 < lpin> http://pastebin.com/jPb0mCxe
19:22 < lpin> the buffer is filled correctly
19:23 < RLa> mattkime, on what
19:23 < lpin> but when i call foo on my node code
19:23 < lpin> it return undefined
19:24 < mattkime> @lpin - i have a development node server. when i start the app, i want it to take care of starting and stopping my sass compiler
19:25 < lpin> it was for RLa i think :P
19:25 < RLa> oh
19:26 < RLa> you could spawn the process at start and kill on exit
19:26 < mattkime> heh, thanks, sorry
19:26 < mattkime> how would i track the process between start and kill?
19:26 < mattkime> starting it is easy
19:26 < mattkime> well, killing it too. i'm just confused about how to track it
19:27 < lpin> callback on end
19:27 < lpin> that kill it
19:27 < mattkime> or have a reference to it
19:27 < lpin> if it is possible
19:31 < lpin> mattkime dunno if you already looked at this http://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_event_exit
19:33 < RLa> process.on('exit', function() { "kill sass" });
19:35 < mattkime> i'd prefer not to kill it by name
19:35 < mattkime> but i do recognize that i'm getting picky and you've given some generous advice already. much appreciated
19:37 < thanpolas> how can i safely know that my script runs on node? (built to run on any env)
19:37 < lpin> you ca use .pid property
19:37 < lpin> was for mattkime
19:38 < dob_> I get this error with mongoose-auth. And I don't have any idea anymore... http://pastebin.com/tBEfymWG
19:39 < mattkime> @lpin - perfect!
19:41 < owen1> anyone at nodeconf? 
19:42 < s5fs> owen1: unfortunately not, but i'm hoping to hang with some of the attendees after hours. you in town?
19:42 < thanpolas> so how can i safely determine that the environment i run on is node.js vs the DOM ?
19:42 < owen1> s5fs: no ):  i want to watch it live if possible, or at least be on a chat with people that are there.
19:43 < owen1> is there any audio/video/chat for this conference?
19:43 < s5fs> owen1: none that i'm aware of
19:44 < s5fs> owen1: i just pinged someone who's in the conf, hopefully they reply with good news.
19:45 < owen1> from twitter: @balupton nope. but edited videos will be posted in a month or so.
19:45 < owen1> so no live videos ):
19:45 < s5fs> booooo
19:48 < owen1> s5fs: when u got any links to the talk names or people's notes, let me know. i'll be monitoring this page - http://lanyrd.com/2012/nodeconf/
19:49 < s5fs> owen1: will do. i live in portland, just couldn't cover the cost of tickets. i'm hoping to hit the bars tonight and meet folks.
19:51 < owen1> s5fs: awesome. how much was it?
19:52 < s5fs> owen1: I believe it was $700, but I don't know if that included lodging or not. in any event, too rich for my blood, haha!
19:54 < mattkime> hm...looks like the exit event is only called if process.exit() is called, is that correct?
19:56 < mikeywaites> hey anyone have much experience with mongoose? im just getting started and feel like im making some wrong decisions, hoping someone can point me in the right direction
19:56 < s5fs> mikeywaites: i've got a tiny bit, whats up?
19:58 < u01p2109> Hello, help me please understand the Node
19:59 < u01p2109> is there some tutorials, books?
19:59 < s5fs> u01p2109: check out nodejs.org/community/
20:00 < mikeywaites> s5fs:  ill post up basically im looking for a better pattern to checking stuff in emebded docs - i seem to be in callback hell
20:01 < mikeywaites> s5fs:  so this is pretty rough, but you should get the general idea, if a word dosent exist in a room, we need to create is else we simply broadcast the word to the room http://dpaste.com/766529/
20:02 < mikeywaites> as you can see its horrible :)
20:02 < shiftpgdn> any ideas why I keep seeing this
20:02 < shiftpgdn> [root@chat home]# node example.js
20:02 < shiftpgdn> Server running at http://50.116.29.9:80/
20:02 < shiftpgdn> This type of response MUST NOT have a body. Ignoring data passed to end().
20:02 < s5fs> mikeywaites: seems like a common problem, i recommend looking into a flow control library
20:03 < mikeywaites> s5fs:  can you recommend any?
20:03 < s5fs> mikeywaites: async is pretty popular
20:04 < mikeywaites> i was wondering if this is more me falling into the "relational" trap and in fact i should just be dinfing the room on the word schema
20:04 < Zamarok> anyone know why I get this error when trying to make? http://codepad.org/XAorZZXR
20:04 < Zamarok> same happens with 0.8.1
20:05 < Zamarok> Googling showed nothing ;(
20:06 < dob_> Where can I get help with mongoose-auth?
20:07 < dob_> I get some strange error and I have no idea why
20:07 <@Nexxy> wauu
20:07 <@Nexxy> s5fs, 
20:07 < s5fs> Nexxy: hi!
20:07 <@Nexxy> ahoy hoy
20:07  * s5fs *bows*
20:08 <@Nexxy> I got a pin of visnup's face!
20:08 < s5fs> haha!!
20:09 < s5fs> Nexxy: is it the same as his twitter feed (ie, face on a qr code)
20:10 <@Nexxy> s5fs, same face w/o teh qr code
20:10 < s5fs> too funny
20:10 <@Nexxy> what we *really* need is a visnup's dog's face sticker
20:10 < jerrysv> shhh. don't say that in front of visnup
20:11 < jerrysv> or it may just happen
20:11 < u01p2109> exit
20:16 < mikeywaites> s5fs:  async looks like a nice pattern to solve the problem, especially the waterfall approach
20:17 < s5fs> mikeywaites: i hear nothing but good things about it, hopefully it works for you!
20:18 < mikeywaites> s5fs:  yeh cheers!
20:27 < chapel> mikeywaites: not sure what the problem is with your code, just that you are going too deep with callbacks?
20:28 < mattkime> i was overthinking this. the child process will closewith the parent
20:30 < owen1> s5fs: $700 is a lot. i thought nodeconf and jsconf are at the $100 range
20:30 < dob_> Where can I get help with mongoose.auth?
20:30 < s5fs> owen1: yeah, I agree, but again I'm not sure if that included lodging.
20:30 < s5fs> owen1: as you're probably noticing, it's hard to get info about this particular conference, haha
20:31 < Zamarok> anyone know why I get this error when trying to make? http://codepad.org/XAorZZXR
20:31 < s5fs> dob_: lots of people are at nodeconf today and tomm, so this is kind of an off week for channel support. keep with it, someone will be able to assist you.
20:31 < Zamarok> running CentOS
20:33 < s5fs> Zamarok: no idea. any reason to not go with 0.8.1?
20:34 < dob_> s5fs: Thank u for answering. I posted my issue https://github.com/bnoguchi/mongoose-auth/issues/113
20:34 < Zamarok> same happens with 0.8.1
20:34 < Zamarok> I tried 0.8.0 to see if that would work for any reason, but really I want 0.8.1 installed
20:34 < bradleymeck> s5fs: just that some modules do not like 0.8 yet, we generally wait 2 weeks
20:39 < s5fs> bradleymeck: understood. in this case Zamarok is strugging to compile 0.8.0 so I suggested 0.8.1 as I expect that to be a bit more stable. that being said is there any "odd point releases are unstable" type versioning in node?
20:40 < bradleymeck> 0.x.y , if x is odd it is unstable
20:40 < s5fs> bradleymeck: okay, good to know :-)
20:43 < s5fs> Zamarok: if it's working with both releases, i'd confirm that you have gcc/g++/etc all installed and working. the msg you posted wasn't super descriptive, at least not for me.
20:44 < manish> anyone have a favorite lib they like to use for loading fixtures for testing
20:44 < manish> ?
20:47 < bradleymeck> manish require('x.json') or require('y.preopulate.js') ?
20:48 < manish> i think i should have been more specific...i'm looking for libs that help with loading fixtures into a mongodb (using the mongodb native lib)
21:03 < plato> anyone know of a job board for node.js?
21:04 < plato> like, where I can post and browse resumes for node.js coders
21:05 < manish> geeklist maybe?
21:05 < manish> are you looking for work or looking to hire?
21:05 < Astro-> where do I find instructions on how to migrate my library's wscript to node 0.8 gyp?
21:06 < s5fs> plato: hacker news has a jobs section too
21:08 < plato> manish, looking to hire for some short term contract work. node/jquery
21:09 < plato> thanks s5fs 
21:09 < plato> and manish 
21:09 < manish> i would use geeklist or coderwall. as a start
21:09 < plato> will explore those ty
21:09 < manish> angel.co/talent is also good
21:15 < myndzi> any known issues with npm stalling?
21:15 < plato> http problem?
21:15 < myndzi> no
21:15 < myndzi> it gets a whole screen of stuff
21:15 < myndzi> then just stops
21:16 < myndzi> i can't ctrl+break and restart, it starts at the beginning
21:16 < plato> what package is it stallign on, i'll try it here
21:16 < myndzi> different packagens each time
21:16 < plato> ick
21:16 < myndzi> but in the same approximate area of the list
21:16 < plato> full?
21:16 < plato> er... is / full
21:16 < myndzi> nope
21:16 < plato> well i'm outta ideas!
21:16 < plato> sry
21:17 < myndzi> np, i'm still workin on it ;)
21:17 < plato> g
21:17 < plato> gl
21:17 < myndzi> just checking since new release recently, maybe it was cropping up
21:17 < myndzi> i told this guy not to upgrade too >:(
21:18 < myndzi> actually wait, i don't think i made it in time
21:19 < myndzi> i bet this dependency tree reads like the npm index
21:21 < myndzi> is there a way to make npm download a package and keep it even if it has an error?
21:21 < mmalecki> myndzi: npm pack package
21:21 < myndzi> thanks
21:21 < mmalecki> it'll leave you with .tgz file which you can unpack
21:22 < myndzi> yeah
21:22 < myndzi> gyp got ditched in 0.8 right?
21:26 < catilac> Is it possible to create a readStream for data in a Buffer?
21:29 < STRML> myndzi: gyp was made the default, waf was ditched in 0.8
21:30 < myndzi> ah
21:30 < myndzi> well gyp rebuild is giving me errors
21:30 < myndzi> i'm not quite sure what they mean :|
21:30 < myndzi> a bunch of "unknown option"
21:33 < myndzi> hmm ok
21:34 < myndzi> i've installed everything by hand, it seems to be stalling on explicit git urls
21:34 < myndzi> no output of any kind
21:34 < myndzi> ideas?
21:53 < thedahv> crap. I was hoping TJ would have been in here
21:54 < thedahv> Anybody on the channel have experience organizing a mocha test suite across multiple folders
21:54 < thedahv> Say, for example, I have within a "test" folder, other folders for things like "backbone", "persistence", and so on
21:54 < thedahv> To organize my test files
21:54 < jergason> thedahv: Yes, and it worked fine for me.
21:54 < thedahv> Is there some kind of way I can tell mocha about those folders and have it run tests in there?
21:55 < thedahv> test.js?
21:55 < jergason> thedahv: mocha test/*
21:55 < thedahv> Yep, that worked
21:55 < thedahv> Thanks!
21:58 < therealkoopa> With socket.io to join a room, you need the socket.  What's the best way to join a room on the server-side inside of an express route?  Most things I see have the client emitting an event that tells the server to join a room. 
22:00 < TimeTurner> therealkoopa: socket.io has nothing to do with express
22:00 < TimeTurner> two separate things
22:00 < therealkoopa> I know that.
22:00 < therealkoopa> But I'm saying, to join a room with socket.io, you need the socket for the client, right?
22:00 < TimeTurner> so just emit an event from the client asking for permission to join
22:01 < TimeTurner> yeah
22:01 < therealkoopa> Instead of the client emitting the event, can't I do this already on the server-side?
22:01 < TimeTurner> normally joining to a client isn't performed inside a specific route
22:01 < TimeTurner> you mean have the server "attach" the client?
22:01 < TimeTurner> not sure
22:01 < TimeTurner> haven't tried anything like that
22:02 < therealkoopa> On the client-side, you're saying it's best to do two things: a. Send the data to the server using a POST (handled with expresss. b.  socket.emit to tell it to join the room?
22:02 < TimeTurner> but normally it's the client's role initiate requests like that
22:02 < therealkoopa> I just figured rather than sending two "requests" even though they are different, I could just do it when the main request is handled with express.
22:02 < TimeTurner> basically, yes
22:03 < TimeTurner> well you could fire off both requests in parallel
22:03 < therealkoopa> That seems a little dirty to me, but maybe it's the best way...
22:03 < TimeTurner> but you have to understand that they are two separate things
22:03 < TimeTurner> one http request is directed at express while the other is directed at socket.io's http server or websocket server
22:03 < TimeTurner> they are two separate http servers
22:03 < myndzi> how the heck do i get debug info about what's failing with node-gyp
22:03 < myndzi> it looks like it's calling python with fail options
22:04 < TimeTurner> socket.io just has an option to listen on the same port express is listening on
22:04 < myndzi> but i can't tell what it's trying to run
22:04 < therealkoopa> Yea, I was thinking it would be best to handle everything in one request rather than two.  So the express would fire a server-side event saying "Hey, this client should join the room"
22:04 < leev> does anyone know if net.createConnection({localAddress: 'an:ipv6:address'}); should work?
22:04 < leev> seems to work with a v4 address, but not v6
22:04 < TimeTurner> that's the hardest part as of now
22:04 < TimeTurner> authentication within socket.io mixed with express and cookies and sessions
22:05 < therealkoopa> Yea, that's a problem I still need to solve.
22:05 < TimeTurner> it's weird setting it up, I know, but that's pretty much the only way to do it
22:05 < TimeTurner> yeah
22:05 < TimeTurner> I think socket.io has much better docs now
22:05 < TimeTurner> to solve authentication/authorization alongside express
22:06 < TimeTurner> leev: I don't think node uses ipv6 yet, but I may be wrong
22:06 < therealkoopa> I am putting that on the backburner.  Okay, so you think the best thing is to have the client send the event so it joins the room?
22:06 < therealkoopa> It's pretty simple if I do it that way.
22:06 < TimeTurner> yep
22:06 < therealkoopa> Thanks.
22:06 < TimeTurner> np
22:07 < leev> TimeTurner: i think i found the issue.  if the host you're connecting to is an ipv6 ip, then localAddr can be an ipv6 ip.  however if you specify a host with an A and AAAA record, i think it chooses the A record, so then the bind fails.
22:10 < wltsmrz> You should be able to parse the cookies for the connection session ID, TimeTurner
22:10 < wltsmrz> If you need your thing to be totally decoupled you can use connect-redis & then query for sess:<id> 
22:10 < wltsmrz> It'll be there
22:13 < TimeTurner> leev: ahh, yeah I was thinking that may be it as well. although node seems to be working the opposite way that most real routers work. usually the routers queries the DNS for a AAAA if the client has ipv6 and then A. weird
22:14 < TimeTurner> altsmrz: yeah I'm using connect-redis for sessions right now. haven't gotten around to tying socket.io to it yet but I'm still wary of what other information socket.io stores about the client in redis by itself
22:15 < TimeTurner> originally i wanted to combine the information that socket.io stored in redis and merge it with the session object in redis but I guess those need to stay decoupled
22:15 < wltsmrz> :shrug:
22:16 < TimeTurner> do you have code for socket.io to query redis for the session stuff where connect-redis stores it?
22:17 < TimeTurner> :)
22:17 < wltsmrz> I use the 'ws' module but it should be similar. Can't you access the upgrade request on incoming sockets in socket.io?
22:18 < TimeTurner> upgrade request?
22:19 < TimeTurner> I thought socket.io downgraded
22:20 < leev> laptop just crashed and took 3 reboots to turn on :(
22:21 < jocafa> 777 users
22:22 < jocafa> well.. was.
22:22 < mmalecki> leev: linux sometimes does that
22:24 < wltsmrz> Maybe something like this, TimeTurner http://pastie.org/pastes/4189731/text?key=xvmmfe2tmfzirinwdndytq
22:25 < wltsmrz> Like I say, the important thing is that connect-redis uses (by default) the 'sess:' prefix for session keys
22:25 < TimeTurner> wait does connect-redis automatically set the sess: prefix?
22:26 < wltsmrz> Yep
22:26 < wltsmrz> All session keys by default are prefixed with "sess:"
22:26 < wltsmrz> And connect-redis uses redis strings (not hashes)
22:27 < wltsmrz> So 'get' is the redis command you want to use
22:27 < wltsmrz> Unless I'm so tired that I'm remembering that incorrectly!
22:27 < wltsmrz> https://github.com/visionmedia/connect-redis/blob/master/lib/connect-redis.js#L47
22:29 < TimeTurner> sweet
22:30 < TimeTurner> thanks!
22:30 < wltsmrz> No problem, good luck. 
22:32 < wltsmrz> (Oh you'll want to unescape that session ID string as well)
22:32 < wltsmrz> (But it's possible to achieve this, anyway)
22:48 < dob_> do you know if it's possible to register more than one form for a mongoose auth password registration? I need one form form for users and one for administrative users. 
22:51 < TimeTurner> any idea what this means
22:51 < TimeTurner> TypeError: Converting circular structure to JSON
22:51 < TimeTurner> res.write(JSON.stringify(req));
22:57 < wltsmrz> Means there are circular references in req and it is not JSON-stringifiable
22:57 < wltsmrz> Can't you console.log it?
22:57 < wltsmrz> (Assume you're debugging)
23:05 <@Nexxy> no, rwaldron ... you are the problem.
23:05 <@Nexxy> muahahahahaaaaa.
23:05 < rwaldron> <3
23:05 < rwaldron> Nexxy ^
23:05 <@Nexxy> :D
23:05 <@Nexxy> <3
23:07 < TimeTurner> no I can't console.log it either
23:08 < TimeTurner> same typeError
23:08 < TimeTurner> that's the error stack http://pastie.org/private/jk1yf1eln7lydfexaz3xa
23:13 < piklu> GOOD MORNING NODERS
23:15 < piklu> Nexxy: morning
23:17 < wltsmrz> No, TimeTurner, you should be able to log the object itself :)
23:17 < wltsmrz> Not the JSON-stringified object
23:21 <@Nexxy> piklu, hai :)
23:21 < piklu> wazzz up boys?
23:21 < piklu> anything new @ node?
23:21 <@Nexxy> I'll ask !
23:22 < piklu> he he
23:22 < piklu> so do
23:22 < piklu> we lack highly scalable open source software like wordpress for node.js
23:22 < wookiehangover> CHESTBUMPS AND HIGHFIVES IS WUZZZ UP
23:23 < Karmaon> BEHOLD! None-the-less other than node! http://i.imgur.com/NSpKC.png
23:23 <@Nexxy> and there you have it!
23:23 < Karmaon> lol ,what are we here, now I have to worry about cpu leak issues
23:23 < Karmaon> and thats on a m1.large on ec2
23:24 < piklu> Karmaon, isnt it a little bad?
23:24 < piklu> this drops ? like that
23:24 < Karmaon> piklu, i realized my api was down
23:24 < Karmaon> since i had angry customers yelling at me
23:24 < Karmaon> then i restarted node
23:24 < piklu> Karmaon : what do u supply to them?
23:25 < Karmaon> some bitcoin service
23:25 < piklu> lol
23:25 < piklu> seriously
23:25 < Karmaon> bitcoin api
23:25 < piklu> dnt tell me that u are that webservice selling browser based bitcoin generation
23:25 < piklu> are u?
23:25 < Karmaon> no
23:25 < Karmaon> that would be silly
23:25 < piklu> oh, did u see them, it aint silly though completely
23:26 < piklu> so bitcoins are generated on your servers?
23:26 < Karmaon> no, no generation
23:26 < Karmaon> just api
23:27 < Karmaon> and 100% cpu again
23:27 < piklu> explain me your services, plz :)
23:28 < Karmaon> after i resolve this uptime-critical app :)
23:29 < piklu> karmaon, may be i can help
23:29 < piklu> are u sure node is eating that cpu?
23:32 < Karmaon__> piklu, <Karmaon> yes, node is the only thing on the server
23:32 < Karmaon__> <Karmaon> database is separate
23:32 < Karmaon__> sorry, didn't know if you got those.
23:35 < bradleymeck> anyone know if there is a raw socket module lying around
23:36 < Karmaon__> node is clearly more cpu intensive than memory
23:37 < Karmaon__> 1.4% of 7gb, but 10-100% of 4 cores
23:38 < bradleymeck> Karmaon__: ill presume top has nothing interesting, but are you emitting lots of events that are not being consumed?
23:39 < tbranyen> Karmaon__: one of my projects that uses node had a similar 100% cpu issue
23:39 < tbranyen> a reboot fixed it
23:39 < tbranyen> we think it has to do with the leap second issue since thats what many posts are claiming
23:39 < Karmaon__> bradleymeck, emitting none :)
23:40 < piklu> karmaon : is it happening for first time, yes a reboot may fix it. you can use that option
23:40 < Karmaon__> tbranyen, well this issue has been here before
23:40 < Karmaon__> m1.small wasn't enough for node, yet it was using < 3% memory
23:40 < tbranyen> :-/
23:40 < Karmaon__> so I moved it to m1.large
23:43 < owen1> anyone want to give us insights from nodeconf?
23:43 < wltsmrz> The High CPU instances should be cheaper than a regular large instance, right Karmaon__?
23:45  * mifadir0 Helloeverybody
23:45 < wltsmrz> Medium high CPU on-demand instance is about 1/2 the price of a large
23:46 < piklu> Karmaon : why amazon !! 
23:46 < piklu> Karmaon : you have 100 places better than that
23:46 < wltsmrz> And 5 EC2 compute units vs 4
23:46 < wltsmrz> (In the large)
23:46 < wltsmrz> Example, piklu
23:46 < piklu> wltsmrz : linode
23:47 < piklu> wltsmrz : it also depends on what u need, but if u need raw computing power amazon doesnt competes
23:47 < Karmaon__> piklu, what other places are 'better'?
23:47 < wltsmrz> I know that much, piklu. 
23:48 < wltsmrz> My recollection is that linode's bandwidth limitations were relatively severe
23:48 < piklu> Karmaon_: you need a scalable web server right ?
23:48 < Karmaon__> wltsmrz, we didn't want to move b/c it would cause downtime
23:48 < Karmaon__> but it seems optimal for now, since not moving would cause more downtime
23:49 < wltsmrz> Right
23:50 < piklu> wltsmrz : there are many providers that are running onapp as a cloud base and some are pretty fast
23:50 < piklu> Karmaon__: if u need options for infrastructure talk to me any time :)
23:51 < mifadir0> can i see an example of web site written in node?
23:51 < wltsmrz> Bare minimum or a "real website?"
23:52 < piklu> u.jit.su is bare minimum
23:52 < Karmaon__> this is not funny, 40/requests  per second
23:52 < Karmaon__> and causing cpu issues
23:52 < mifadir0> real?
23:52 < mifadir0> if possible
23:52 < wltsmrz> require('http').createServer(a,b){b.end('website')}).listen(8080)
23:53 < wltsmrz> Realer than real deal holyfield
23:53 < piklu> mifadir0: http://www.nodejsmvc.com/
23:54 < tim_smart> wltsmrz: What language is that?
23:54 < tim_smart> It ain't javascript
23:54 < piklu> tim_smart : ?
23:54 < MrV> hello, does anyone have experience using the sqlite3 module?
23:54 < piklu> :)
23:54 < wltsmrz> MyScript v1.0
23:55 < tim_smart> wltsmrz: It is missing a function keyword ;)
23:55 < wltsmrz> Doh
23:55 < wltsmrz> Listen I can explain!
23:56 < tim_smart> require('http').createserver(function (q, r) r:done('website') end):listen(8080) <- luvit code is quite similar
23:56 < piklu> alias function ?? by  something totally good
23:56 < wltsmrz> 'createserver' ?!
23:56 < mifadir0> how much time you spend on it?piklu
23:56 < mmalecki> tim_smart: btw, I forgot to ping you, https://github.com/Marak/colors.js/commit/adf06f0988ad72d437275c192a7503421cd853ba
23:57 < tim_smart> mmalecki: That doesn't solve the problem ;(
23:57 < tim_smart> mmalecki: Does setProperty set enumerable : false automagically?
23:58 < mmalecki> tim_smart: yeah, that's default
23:58 < tim_smart> Still, it is messing with me prototypes hah, even though it mostly a non-issue, it doesn't sit right with me.
23:59 < mmalecki> I can totally understand that :)
