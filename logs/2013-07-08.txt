00:00 < mbalho> dj_corncob: type /usr/local/share/npm/bin/karma
00:00 < dj_corncob> malho: yeah I just did a 'find' and it's installed there
00:00 < dj_corncob> as well as a few other places too...
00:05 < dj_corncob> it's working now, thank you all
00:26  * Slick` I have very fresh credit cards for sell, from my own sniffers and logs ;) many different bins and countries :) 10$ each, write me any interested in linotrecias@gmail.com
00:31 < drudge> very fresh
00:35 < joshux> how do i make a custom request attribute?
00:36 < ningu> joshux: req.foo = bar;
00:36 < joshux> It has to be read by the redirected page
00:36 < ningu> huh?
00:36 < ningu> you'll have to describe much more clearly what you want to do
00:36 < Beg> ^
00:37 < Beg> Perhaps you think of json joshux?
00:37 < Beg> no, go on tell us, I can keep guessing till tomorow
00:38 < joshux> ok, like in passport.js , when authenticated, the page redirects and the req.user is filled with information
00:39 < timetocode> i think we're looking at adding some get or post data and then submitting that to the target of the direction
00:39 < timetocode> *redirection
00:40 < joshux> but I search node and express docs , there is no req.user attribute
00:40 < joshux> I see
00:40 < Beg> timetocode > not really? I think we need to add "attributes" to the user
00:40 < ningu> joshux: it's usually loaded from the database based on a key set in a cookie that the client sends
00:40 < Beg> perhaps ningu knows how passport works, but I can only answer based on assumptions
00:40 < ningu> I don't know how passport.js works but I know how auth in general works
00:41 < joshux> so do you think passport.js gets a post data and then added the user attribute via middleware?
00:42 < Beg> Passport gets it's information from the cookie, which contains a unique string that is called Session ID
00:43 < Beg> and then it translates that to a user, then how it adds it to the request, I don't know, but if you can access user's attributes, your best bet is to try to manipulate the database or see if passport offers some functions of it's own to manipulate the user.
00:43 < joshux> I see, thanks you guys :)
00:44 < ningu> joshux: passport does this for you, I am almost sure. you do need to set up a session store. but that should be in the docs
00:46 <@MI6> joyent/node: Ben Noordhuis master * 7684e0b : test: fix up weakref.cc after v8 api change (+8 more commits) - http://git.io/cgc9Gg
00:47 < bnoordhuis> gentlemen, rebase your pull requests
00:50 < Beg> So are there any node.js events in sweden?
00:50 < mbalho> i was at web rebels in oslo and there was a buncha node people there, i wouldnt be surprised
00:51 < zomg> Anyone got any recommendations for tools to do "full stack" browser testing?
00:51 < jbrokc> hey all, i installed node via homebrew (along with npm) and when I install packages globally, nothing is being put into npm's global modules folder (/usr/local/share/npm/bin/) though they are installed in lib
00:51 < jbrokc> anyone might know why?
00:51 < zomg> casperjs seems like a good start since it also is based on phantomjs
01:04 < sinclair|net> w00t
01:04 < sinclair|net> https://github.com/sinclairzx81/typescript.api/blob/master/src/reflect/Reflection.ts
01:04 < sinclair|net> ^ code anyone could be proud of
01:05 <@MI6> joyent/node: Ben Noordhuis master * 0181fee : build: don't enable --gc-sections on sunos - http://git.io/aV6rCg
01:07 < qq99> anyone had fruitful results integration/end2end testing a project using socket.io?
01:07 < qq99> not entirely sure how I could get any meaningful consistent tests without a whole bunch of waiting between multiple clients sending stuff
01:27 <@MI6> joyent/node: Timothy J Fontaine master * fe17692 : timers: internal unref timers should use Timer.now - http://git.io/7whcew
01:27 < ningu> now I know tjfontaine's first name
01:27 < ningu> I wonder what the other tj's real name(s) are
01:27 <@tjfontaine> OH NO I'M SCREWED
01:27 < ningu> hehe
01:28 < ningu> some people are just named TJ
01:28 <@tjfontaine> it's true, I went to high school with one
01:29 <@tjfontaine> in school I went by Tim, but family and friends called me TJ because my dad is also named Tim
01:29 <@tjfontaine> then I get involved in node, and I introduce myself as "nope, not that TJ"
01:29 < ningu> :)
01:29 <@tjfontaine> just like isaacbw goes "nope, not that isaac"
01:29 <@tjfontaine> it's like we're all playing a big shell game
01:29 < ningu> I'm Dave and there are always a million Daves
01:31 < ningu> as long as the shell game is in bash it should be good
01:31 <@isaacbw> zsh 4 lyfe
01:32 < ningu> the problem with zsh is how do you pronounce it?
01:32 <@isaacbw> zzzssshhhh
01:32 < brimstone> zish
01:33 < brimstone> rhymes with fish 
01:33 < ningu> I don't know about zsh but z.sh at https://github.com/rupa/z is *awesome*
01:33 < ningu> z <foo> to switch to any recent dir matching <foo>
01:34 < mmalecki> I say it like z-sh
01:34 <@isaacbw> frecency
01:34 <@isaacbw> wut
01:34 < ningu> isaacbw: hehe
01:34 < ningu> yeah that's a bit eccentric
01:34 < ningu> but it works well
01:34 < ningu> frequency + recency
01:35 <@isaacbw> oh lol
01:35 <@isaacbw> that's silly
01:35 < ningu> the word or the concept>
01:35 <@isaacbw> the word
01:35 <@tjfontaine> z s h, what is wrong with you people :)
01:35 <@tjfontaine> like the people who don't say: my s q l :P
01:36 < ningu> tjfontaine: I like to say CRLF as "curliff"
01:36 < ChrisPartridge> tjfontaine: I've had someone call it "mis-queel" 
01:36 < mbalho> lol
01:36 <@tjfontaine> ChrisPartridge: were they high?
01:36 < ningu> I squeal, you squeal, we all squeal for mysql
01:38 <@isaacbw> now how do you pronounce postgres
01:38 <@isaacbw> it's a weird fucking word
01:38 < Lorentz> post-gre-s
01:38 < ChrisPartridge> tjfontaine: just technically illiterate
01:38 < mmalecki> how do you pronounce node.js?
01:38 <@tjfontaine> "post-grace" ish
01:38 <@tjfontaine> some times just postgre
01:38 <@isaacbw> nod-edges
01:38 < ChrisPartridge> i just call it, "pee-gee"
01:38 < ningu> also, nodemon is "no demon"
01:39 < mbalho> node.js is pronounced 'node point javascript
01:39 < Lorentz> nod-e-dot-javascript
01:39 < mmalecki> node point java scripts
01:39 < ningu> I say "node J-S" with no "dot"
01:39 < mbalho> yea no dot but 'point' is mandatory or else you're wrong
01:39 <@tjfontaine> I pronouce it, IM COOLER THAN YOU
01:40 < mmalecki> tjfontaine: you need a mustache to do that tho
01:40 < Lorentz> should pronounce it "deal with it"
01:40 <@tjfontaine> mmalecki: my neck beard isn't sufficient?
01:40 < ningu> there should be a list of enterprise-approved software term pronunciations
01:40 < Lorentz> ningu: png is pronounced "ping"
01:41 < ningu> I get the sense that "sequel" is from folks who've been using databases for a long time
01:42 < ningu> what about "parse", is the last sound "s" or "z"? does it rhyme with "cars" or "farce"?
01:42 <@tjfontaine> we need more rewters
01:42 < Lorentz> sort of pass + arse
01:43 < jwm>  anyway to not have socket.io's emit queue up?
01:43 < jwm> it seems like it stays in memory until my other node connects to it
01:44 < ningu> jwm: what do you want it to do, just drop the messages, or what?
01:46 < jwm> yeah
01:46 < jwm> I don't want it to linger
01:47 < azbyin> jwm, use volatile
01:47 < azbyin> socket.volatile.emit(...)
01:47 < jwm> ahh
01:47 < jwm> I forgot about that one
01:47 < jwm> thanks
01:51 < jwm> not sure why I forgot about that
01:51 < jwm> read the docs 42 times now
01:51 < jwm> heh
01:52 < azbyin> good. it could imply i read it more times than you :O
01:52 < jwm> hmm
01:52 < jwm> crash on volatile :)
01:53 < jwm> ahh
01:53 < jwm> have to have a handle to the socket inside the function
01:54 < jwm> ohh
01:54 < jwm> it can only be server side?
01:55 < azbyin> lol, you want to send volatile from client? i'm not sure if thats the case..
01:56 < jwm> yeah
01:56 < jwm> incase the server is down
01:56 < jwm> well really the client is the server in this case
01:56 < jwm> heh
01:56 < jwm> node < - > node
01:56 < jwm> both are servers whatever..
01:56 < azbyin> well, wouldn't you simply get an error?
01:56 < jwm> nope
01:57 < jwm> it just holds on to it
01:57 < azbyin> eh, node to node why can;t you simply use volatile ?
01:57 < jwm> because one is a client connection
01:57 < jwm> socket.io-client
01:57 < jwm> yeah apparently there is a request for this
02:01 < jwm> crap
02:01 < jwm> looks like it is not really possible
02:01 < jwm> I'll add some more damn code 
02:01 < jwm> heh
02:01 < plops> hi!!
02:01 < azbyin> wait, i don;t get it.. wouldn;t the emit fail? and you are able to detect it, no?
02:02 < jwm> no it buffers them
02:02 < jwm> until reconnect
02:02 < jwm> which isn't good since I am using this as a db transport with a lot of data
02:02 < jwm> heh
02:03 < jwm> I'll just push a value when I call emit and if the value isn't popped/clear once I do another emit then I won't emit heh
02:03 < azbyin> for replication? you should be using the db's own methods for replication rather than rolling out your own
02:06 < jwm> the monitoring server I am coding is behind a firewall on a private network
02:06 < jwm> and has limited storage capabilities
02:07 < jwm> so it has to store all data remotely on an internet attached device
02:07 < jwm> I'd have to do a vpn which is against policy 
02:07 < jwm> I just have basic http/https capabilities outgoing
02:07 < jwm> even that is behind a proxy
02:07 < jwm> heh
02:07 < jwm> which degrades my damn websockets to xhrpolling
02:08 < n0cturnal> run your daemon on 443, see if the proxy just passes it straight through?
02:09 < jwm> yeah I'd rather follow the strict regs heh
02:09 < jwm> its working 
02:09 < owen1> I write an express + domains example app and don't understand why my domain is not catching this error - https://github.com/oren/domains-examples/blob/master/express/server.js#L35 (the domain is defined in the first middleware - domainifier.js)
02:09 < azbyin> http://www.rutschle.net/tech/sslh.shtml ?
02:10 < jwm> yeah I've already looked at that
02:10 < jwm> ssh connections are reset pretty frequent
02:10 < jwm> I have to use autossh heh
02:11 < azbyin> yeah and? thats a minor inconvenience compared to rolling your own db mirroring operation
02:11 < jwm> I'm just spitting out about 300kb of text
02:11 < jwm> then doing a mongoose save 
02:11 < jwm> not very difficult
02:14 < azbyin> i meant when the mirroring fails, you blame mongo and squarely point at it ;)
02:15 < jwm> hehe
02:16 < jwm> yeah
02:16 < jwm> well
02:16 < jwm> I have written 0 error checking code so far for this project
02:16 < jwm> and I'm already a month in
02:16 < jwm> hehe
02:19 < Crystalvoid> jwm... and they call me crazy
02:20 < jwm> yeah 
02:21 < jwm> well learning as I go along
02:21 < jwm> which is even scarrier
02:21 < Crystalvoid> so am i.. i find error checking to help with learning tho
02:22 < Crystalvoid> tho maybe sanity testing is a better way of describing it
02:23 < fesener_> Hi everyone I'm following a tutorial to build a multiroom chat system but what I Want to do is when user joins another channel than the default one, he/she should see a totally different interface
02:23 < fesener_> would someone tell me how can I do such thing
02:24 < Hotroot> fesener_: We need more info than that. 
02:24 < Hotroot> What tutorial? What interface? What code? 
02:24 < fesener_> http://psitsmike.com/2011/10/node-js-and-socket-io-multiroom-chat-tutorial/
02:24 < fesener_> this one I've built, I've put only single room system at the moment
02:24 < fesener_> what I want to do is
02:25 < fesener_> if a user joins a created channel, the creator of the channel will see amongst those channel users and pick 10 of them
02:25 < fesener_> so if a user joing another chat room, its not just a chat interface after that
02:25 < fesener_> its a list of users and creator will chose 10 people amongst those and put in 2 different teams
02:26 < fesener_> then creator will initiate an event that will send info of these 10 people to my django server
02:26 <@isaacbw> bigfoot is real
02:27 < fesener_> is this enough information Hotroot 
02:28 < Hotroot> Sort of. Where are you specifically having a problem? Knowing how to send different HTML based on socket.io room names? 
02:28 < fesener_> yes i dont know even if thats possible
02:28 < fesener_> all I have is a single room chat interface with messages and userlist so far
02:29 <@isaacbw> fdjs;lkasjd
02:29 < fesener_> which uses Django auth system to authentice 
02:29 <@isaacbw> what are you doing with django and node
02:29 < Hotroot> Yes, it's of course possible to send back different HTML based on node variables. 
02:29 <@isaacbw> everything is possible!
02:29 < fesener_> isaacbw, what ?
02:29 <@isaacbw> what what
02:30 < fesener_> Hotroot, how to do that?
02:30 < Hotroot> It's asking a bit much for someone to know node.js, Django, socket.io, and then understand your project and be willing to write it out though.
02:30 < fesener_> isaacbw, what do you mean by "what are you doing with django and node" :p
02:30 < jdelgado> isaacbw: in the butt
02:30 < fesener_> no no Hotroot sorry
02:30 < fesener_> it was not what im asking for sorry i cant tell it properly
02:31 < Hotroot> Jesus I hate when people use weird code CSS on their page. I can't read medium grey on light grey. Why do people not get this
02:31 <@tjfontaine> I had someone send me a feeler for a job with an "adult entertainment" company that was basically that Hotroot 
02:31 < jdelgado> tjfontaine: Take the job!
02:31 <@isaacbw> tjfontaine: forward that to me
02:31 < Hotroot> tjfontaine: At least job implies being paid though
02:32 < fesener_> now what django does is only rendering an html with sending some variables from system so i can use them in html via {{ variable }} so django stuff is not relevant, the problem is my lack of knowledge about node/socket system
02:32 <@tjfontaine> jdelgado: heh, I like my current job better :)
02:32 < fesener_> i just wanna know how to show different interface to user if he joins a socket.room a.k.a channel
02:32 <@tjfontaine> isaacbw: hah, I can tell you the domain if you are actually interested
02:33 < Hotroot> fesener_: I have 0 knowledge about passing from node to Django. I don't use django. I do know express though, and you have multiple options depending on how lazy you are.
02:33 < MitchW_> lol, oh dear - node.xxx here we come
02:33 < jdelgado> tjfontaine: lol send me the domain, I want to see how bad it is
02:33 <@isaacbw> lol, I'm not really interested in the job but I'm sort of curious about the domain now
02:33 < Hotroot> You can pass html in string form, you can read a separate file in, or you can use templates.
02:33 <@tjfontaine> stupid channel being indexed
02:33 <@isaacbw> fesener_: what you're asking for is someone to explain to you some really fundamental things about application structure
02:33 <@tjfontaine> I noticed both of you with it
02:34 <@isaacbw> it's not just "put these lines of code in"
02:34 <@isaacbw> oh man that domain
02:34 <@tjfontaine> indeed
02:34 < jdelgado> lmfao
02:34 < fesener_> yes thats what I want isaacbw, not codes just how a structure like that works
02:34 <@isaacbw> fesener_: it's a very big question that can't really be answerd well in irc
02:34 < jdelgado> tjfontaine: Yeah, smart choice to pass that up
02:34 < Hotroot> fesener_: Anyway, I stated the three main ways of presenting html above.
02:35 <@isaacbw> you need to read more source code
02:35 < MitchW_> fesener_: start by learning javascript, then look at the socket.io documentation - the 'structure' is already in the tutorial you posted.
02:35 <@tjfontaine> jdelgado: heh
02:35 < Hotroot> Definitely know Javascript, HTML, and understand express and socket.io before attempting to modify a lot.
02:35 < fesener_> MitchW_, it has nothing about that "different interface if a user choses a channel" thing and I know nothing about this thing either and all my researches on google gives me nothing
02:35 <@isaacbw> people need to read more code
02:35 < fesener_> but its a great source nonetheless
02:36 < fesener_> thought me a lot about node.js/socket structure
02:38 < Hotroot> fesener_: If you know JavaScript, socket.io, and express, it should be fairly obvious how to programatically change HTML sent. I can answer specific questions as I use all three, but your main question is too broad.
02:39 < Hotroot> I love using these super abstracted libs. It's like the sitcom version of code, I can shut half my brain off.
02:40 < MitchW_> my main project has just recently gone over 10k lines of code (~30 modules), i wish i could shut my brain off :(
02:43 < Hotroot> MitchW_: I hate when code gets too long =/ What project?
02:43 < Lorentz> I like long code
02:43 < Lorentz> it's like a long novel
02:44 < Lorentz> guess I'm not a poetry kind of person
02:44 < Hotroot> Lorentz: Brevity is the soul of wit.
02:46 < MitchW_> Hotroot: paas-like service infrastructure (something between parse and dotcloud) that runs some internal services/apps, tis a giant mind-f@!$ currently - slowly being melded into an actual product
02:46 < Lorentz> Don't mistake large quantity of brevity as verbosity
02:47 < Hotroot> MitchW_: Ah.
02:48 < Hotroot> Lorentz: Right, just depends on what you meant by "long code".
02:48 < Hotroot> and "like a long novel". 
02:48 < Lorentz> Hotroot: it's like music
02:48 < Lorentz> I like listening to whole albums in one sitting, kind of thing
02:48 < Hotroot> I love when code is split into as many functions as possible with perfect names and very little/predictable side effects.  
02:49 < Hotroot> I think of long blocks of imperative code as novel-esque, but that was just my interpretation.
02:49 < Lorentz> well, it really depends on the code
02:50 < MitchW_> I don't mind 'long'/large code bases - really does your brain over when it's under heavy development though
02:50 < Hotroot> This is weird. I'm using literally the same code to make an icon appear for mouseOver and click, but they appear in different spots.
02:51 < MitchW_> last job was the largest code base I'd ever worked on (~1.8mil loc over ~20 libraries & 4 commercial products/applications), despite being so large it was relatively easy to work with though due to the stable nature of most of it (and excessive documentation/unit-tests)
02:51 < ningu> I prefer a small codbase because it smells less
02:51 < Lorentz> MitchW_: just like any decently written and large code
02:52 < ningu> but I do like cod
02:52 < sinclair|net> Lorentz: oh hello
02:52 < MitchW_> Lorentz: indeed.  of that 1.8mil the majority of it was all unit tests, the actual code itself would've been maybe 30-35% of it.
02:52 < Lorentz> sinclair: hi
02:54 < sinclair|net> Lorentz: http://pastebin.com/Gh7URCDX <-- reflection bro, just like in .net
02:56 < sinclair|net> Lorentz: got a minute?
02:56 < Lorentz> sinclair|net: sure?
02:56 < Lorentz> and what is that
03:56 < MitchW_> Lorentz: looks like one of the attempts of rtti/reflection/etc in typescript
03:57 <@nexxy> there is this thing called nodebotsday that's happening
03:57 <@nexxy> it's going to be a lot of fun
03:57 <@nexxy> everyone should go
03:58 <@nexxy> nodebotsday.com
03:59 < Lorentz> $20 for a day of fun
04:02 < Lorentz> didn't know people did robotics programming in nodejs
04:02 <@nexxy> Lorentz, :D
04:03 < gkatsev> nexxy: ooooh, that's awesome
04:03 < gkatsev> cool, bocoup is running one.
04:03 < Lorentz> there's one in sydney
04:15 < MitchW_> need some opencog bindings to node >.<
04:16 <@MI6> joyent/node: Peter Rust master * 82ff891 : http: use an unref'd timer to fix delay in exit - http://git.io/QEpqaQ
04:26 < Lorentz> nodejs powered CNC mill
04:27 < gkatsev> node power all the things
04:32 < andrewaclt> Can anybody recommend a user locale module for node? I just want to make an educated guess which country the user is from based on the accept-language header
04:35 < Guest60416> Hi, I've instaled OPA on BackTrack 5 R3 32.  When I try to verify the install with opa --version, I get an error, "GLIBC_2.15' not found"
04:35 < Guest60416> Any ideas?
04:42 < owen1> why my domain is not catching this? https://github.com/oren/domains-examples/blob/master/express/server.js#L35 
04:42 < owen1> but it catchs line 10 just fine!
04:55 < fesener_> hi everyone, i've tried to develop a small chat example using node.js in my website and I've used "clients[user.username] = user.username" to save user in my server, later I wanted to save user.user.id aswell and sent this information to my server too
04:55 < fesener_> and I've changed clients[user.username] = user.username to clients[user.username] = { 'socketid': socket.id, 'userid':user.userid }; and everything seems to be working without changing anything else
04:56 < fesener_> does that mean clients[user.username] = username actually is clients[user.username] = { 'username': user.username} automatically
04:56 < fesener_> or am I missing something
05:27 < Beg> what is up with all the new fancy urls?
05:28 <@nexxy> I want a fancy url
05:28 < Beg> i bet ya wold
05:28 < Beg> how are ya nexxy
05:28 < gkatsev> which new fancy urls?
05:28 < Beg> there's some new page called likes.com that's advertised on frontpage of youtube for me
05:28 < Beg> and then we have meteor.com
05:29 <@nexxy> seems unrelated
05:30 < Beg> I don't really know how to explain it with my bad english
05:30 < ningu> what's fancy about it?
05:31 < Beg> not fancy, but they seem to be domains that would cost alot of money to get, and i see them alot more frequent now than a year or two years ago.
05:31 < Beg> why isn't youtube named video.com for instance?
05:31 < Beg> or facebook, named community
05:32 < faraway> hi, i have a webserver written in node. everthing works fine, and i also know how to use multiple cores with 'cluster'.
05:32 < faraway> Now (just to try some different approaches) i'm wondering if it is possible to pass a opened socket directly to a certain child, so that i have direct controll over which child is handling a certain request (the idea is that a a certain child is responsible for a certain url)
05:32 <@nexxy> Beg, agreed
05:33 < ningu> faraway: hmm, good question, I have no idea
05:33 < faraway> as i said i would like to test different approaches (i alread wrote a test where i pass the incoming request to the child by another opend unix file socket)
05:33 < faraway> But as i said i'm wondering if it is directly possible to pass a socket to a child without opening another one as "proxy"
05:34 < Beg> in sweden our laws got changed so that you cannot buy domains anymore just to resell it later, you have to have a valid reason to own a trademarked domain and you can request a domain for your company that was started after the domain was bought if the domain name was just bought for reserving the name without reason
05:38 < ningu> I thought we had some anti-cyber-squatting laws in the US now too
05:40 < Beg> now? recently? 
05:43 < ningu> Beg: not sure, I could be wrong
05:50 < Beg> ningu alright
05:51 < Beg> Screw this, screw programming I need a lesson in english. Next time I get spare time, english course it is!
05:52 < ningu> :)
05:58 < gigo1980> hi all, if i´ll try typescript for an node project. what does need to start ? so i have installes intellij with node.js and typescript… i also read the manpage for typescript
05:58 < gigo1980> so what does i have to do to get intellisense for existing node.js modules ?
05:59 < gigo1980> i find an git project. but this only maintained till version 0.8.8
06:01 < ningu> gigo1980: wait for sinclair|net to show up and ask him
06:01 < ningu> he is our resident typescripter
06:02 < ningu> and he will probably be glad to see you :P
06:02  * sinclair|net is here
06:02 < sinclair|net> omg, another typescripter
06:02 < sinclair|net> anyone played that ps3 game journey?
06:02 < sinclair|net> its like that
06:03 < azbyin> what if any xml library do you guys use?
06:03 < ningu> azbyin: I use cheerio
06:03 < azbyin> i want something that has namespace support
06:04 < ningu> ok, different need
06:04 < ningu> so I dunno
06:04 < sinclair|net> gigo1980: ?
06:04 < ningu> sinclair|net: probably just was a matter of time, typescript is not that poorly known, really
06:04 < azbyin> jquery is weird.. on the client side i can user jquery and it works fine including namespaces, but it completely dies in ff
06:05 < azbyin> so i'm a bit reluctant to jump into that within node as well
06:05 < ningu> azbyin: strange. well, cheerio != jquery
06:05 < ningu> cheerio is based on htmlparser2
06:05 < ningu> I mean, for its parsing
06:06 < ningu> https://github.com/fb55/htmlparser2
06:07 < ningu> azbyin: it's kind of underdocumented unfortunately
06:07 < ningu> but it's fast and efficient (htmlparser2 that is)
06:08 < ningu> namespaces though, I dunno
06:09 < azbyin> theres https://npmjs.org/package/big-xml and https://npmjs.org/package/xml-events  but no idea if/how they handle namespaces
06:10 < ningu> https://github.com/robrighter/node-xml
06:10 < azbyin> then ofcourse theres https://npmjs.org/package/libxml which is a wrapper for the native libxml2
06:11 < ningu> that too, yeah
06:13 < faraway> hmm … "namespace.new(someArguments)"  is a property named 'new'  of 'namespace' holding a function, right? But i always thought "new" is a reserved keyword and (even if it works) should not be used that way? Or am i wrong about this?
06:16 < azbyin> new here is an object key/property. you cannot name your variables 'new'
06:16 < azbyin> and indeed having a property called 'new' makes little sense as it doesn;t explain what it does/holds within the object
06:19 < insel> i m confused about async.(for)each / queue. if i m using a http.get in the function-body and displaying the url in the on(end)-part, why is the "get"-order still the same order as in the foreach-loop/queue and not depending on the http-size. comparing to the do-nothing-and-wait-example in https://github.com/caolan/async that seemes not logic
06:21 < ningu> insel: it shouldn't be the same order unless it's eachSeries
06:21 < faraway> azbyin: well it looks like a factory method of that library, anyway a very unfamiliar coding style. I don't think that i would like to get used to this ^^ 
06:24 < ChrisPartridge> faraway: it would be better if they called it namespace.createWhateverItIs() as per most of the node core libs
06:27 < insel> ningu: should multiple http.gets always be async? 
06:30 < ChrisPartridge> insel: if you are working with async and http, make sure you dont get caught by the default pooling from the http agent
06:31 < faraway> I totally agree. If i look for libraries i would like to use i always make sure that the api has the "same" coding style like the environment, thats what i was asking. (I'm not completely new to node, but i thought that it is probably a known pattern, that i have never seen)
06:31 < faraway> why i was asking
06:36 < insel> ty i ll check
06:36 < insel> that
06:36 < MitchW_> sinclair|net: you're not the only one who uses typescript, don't worry :)
06:37 < sinclair|net> Mitchare you sure about that?
06:38 < MitchW_> quite. :P  I use it, at least a dozen other typescripters have various issues raised on codeplexed to make it better for node/commonjs scenarios, and multiple people contribute toward the definitely-typed node typings :P
06:45 < serapath> i encounter a strange problem. I have an app.js file and use stylus. i took me the whole night to boil it down to two lines. i have one router and a corresponding template directory and another router with a corresponding template directory
06:45 < serapath> if i switch the router and the corressponding template directory, stylus stops working
06:48 < PeterNor> Guys Help ME
06:49 < AAA_awright> It's called HTTP pipelining, guys
06:50 < Beg> Guys, I give you 10 points if you can solve this
06:50 < Beg> <starta> I have a problem to sendding data via form tag
06:50 < Beg> <starta> I press button but data could n't send to where the action method set
06:50 < Beg> with sarcasm I solve his problem. <Beg> Give the button the type submit <starta> thanks <starta> the problem was submit type
06:51 < Beg> I feel bad for just throwing a random cocky argument out, then I feel double bad because it was correct
06:51 < Beg> now tripple bad because i wrote it here
06:56 < azbyin> lol Beg 
07:00 < ningu> here's a headline you don't see every day: Flight Attendant Denies Smuggling Rats Aboard Plane
07:02 < ChrisPartridge> why on earth would you smuggle rats
07:03 < PeterNor> Why on Earth it's sooo Hard errrrrrrrrrr
07:04 < azbyin> ningu, lol i just read that news item too!
07:04 < pirho> WHAT IF "what if" was what was?
07:04 < azbyin> pirho, time to head home mate
07:05 < pirho> what do you fear my love?
07:05 < pirho> your soul it will float like a dove
07:06 < pirho> your lips they will stutter with flavour
07:06 < sinclair|net> MitchW_: you around?
07:08 < Beg> I've had enough of these ma fa rats on this ma fa plane
07:09 < ningu> I like the for-tv dubbed version: I have had enough of they monkey-fighting snakes on this monday-to-friday plane
07:09 < ningu> these*
07:09 < Beg> hahaha

07:37 < TheOtherOne> hi. I'm trying 'npm install mariasql' on a Win7 x64 machine but getting dozens of errors with: 'Cannot open include file: 'winsock2.h': No such file or directory'
07:38 < ningu> probably need to install visual c++ or similar
07:38 < ningu> whatever provides a normal dev environment on windows, with libraries and headers
07:39 < TheOtherOne> ningu: I installed the windows 7 sdk and winsock2.h is present
07:39 < ningu> oh
07:39 < ningu> dunno then, I don't know how setting paths to those things works on windows
07:39 < TheOtherOne> it looks like npm doesn't look at the right location
07:41 < [AD]Turbo> hi there
07:42 < Beg> hey
07:46 < vicapow> hola
07:49 < insel> how can i interact with with node runing in a terminal window from an other terminal is there something like echo "interact" > /dev/tty1? or a way to push data into the process/queue? or have i to create a interface like telnet or http?
07:50 < ningu> http or a unix socket
07:50 < ningu> or a named pipe
07:51 < insel> is input redirection possible like watch ls mydirectory | node script.js a kind of endless reading from stdin

08:05 < mrbammo> hello
08:06 < mrbammo> I have a question 
08:06 < mrbammo> I want to implement a app on android that connect to socket.io via websocket using socket.io
08:07 < mrbammo> my app can recevive text and file from node.js server
08:07 < mrbammo> But I can't choose 
08:08 < mrbammo> delivery.js  or  socketio-file-upload
08:08 < mrbammo> please help me :)
08:18 < benjaminbenben> mrbammo: delivery.js *from* the node server, socketio-file-upload *to* the node server.  Or you could try binaryjs to send it both ways (though you need to run BinaryServer/ws rather than socket.io)
08:33 < Beg> When I do a math task correct: "YES I WIN"
08:56 < mitradobairro> no
08:57 < Success> i have no clue whats going on these join/quit messages are extremely annoying
09:19 < Success> I just lost all respect for socket.io
09:19 < Success> any alternatives?
09:19 < Siyfion> Anyone used GraphicsMagick for Node at all?
09:19 < Success> isn't that what a browser is for?
09:21 < hallas> Siyfion yes
09:21 < hallas> Success socket.io is awesome
09:21 < Success> did you read the #how-to-use
09:22 < Success> it makes a beiber reference..repeatedly
09:22 < substack> Success: http://npmjs.org/package/websocket-stream http://npmjs.org/package/shoe
09:23 < Success> C:\Program Files\nodejs\node_modules\socket.io\node_modules\socket.io-client\nod

09:23 < Success> \..\node_modules\node-gyp\bin\node-gyp.js" rebuild
09:23 < Success> its three lines before you start whining, thats the standard for no pastebin, that command froze my terminal
09:24 < substack> Success: you need the build toolchain to compile binary modules properly
09:24 < substack> windows doesn't usually have nice things by default
09:24 < Success> substack: i'm on windows how do that
09:24 < Success> do i need to switch to linux?
09:25 < Success> brb reboot
09:25 < r04r> Does anyone happen to know why socket.io's get/set is async?
09:26 < Success> r04r because thats the only logical way to make a server...
09:27 < r04r> Success: I mean the get/set datastore, when associating data with sockets on the server.
09:35 < r04r> Aha, because they support more than just an in-memory store :)
09:40 < fesener_> Hello everyone, I've just made a chat system with the help of some tutorials, I want to show a different UI to users when they join a channel, can using a javascript tab system solves this issue ? i just wanted to confirmation before I start
09:47 < Beg> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GquCjoAUt7s <- this tab system?
09:48 < r04r> Is anyone actually fond of youtube tutorials for programming related tasks?
09:50 < fesener_> Beg, bootstrap's tab system
09:50 < fesener_> must be similar to that
09:50 < Beg> r04r > nope, manual is more than enough :S
09:51 < Beg> fesener_ > alright, yes it is possible.
09:51 < timetocode> if i make a function like   client.load = function(clientId, callback){ callback(rawClientData); }  is there a convention for documenting that the function passed to client.load() should expect to receive rawClientData ?
09:52 < fesener_> Beg, ok thank you!
09:52 < Siyfion> hallas: Sorry for the delay, got pulled afk... Is there a way to specify the file output format without adding an extension to the filepath?
09:53 < Siyfion> hallas: ie. write('tmp/28923n872h8h29', func (err) {} ) but ensure it's saved as a PNG
09:53 < Beg> timetocode > you are asking if I call client.load(x); that x should know it gets the result you will return to it?
09:54 < timetocode> Beg, if someone is reading my client.load code because they love my client library, what type of comment needs to go on this thing so that they know that x is going to get a result
09:55 < timetocode> i'm not even sure what the term is for that result...?
09:55 < Beg> http://nodejs.org/api/http.html 
09:56 < Beg> That's hwo node does it, they have a manual for those kind of things
09:56 < timetocode> doesnt that seem weird that its just left at being a 'callback' though?
09:58 < Beg> I understand your concern, but I don't think that should really matter what the callback returns. usually you could just comment //arg1:string, arg2:array, arg3:object, arg4:mongdbcollection
10:00 < Siyfion> hallas: dw. found it.. setFormat('png')
10:01 < timetocode> i guess that works for me, im going to say that function(playerId, callback) gets a comment like //args: mongoId, callback{player}    or something like that}
10:23 < khurram> hello
10:25 < staar2> hello
10:25 < tsunamie> does anyone use Git?
10:26 < tsunamie> to manage there nodejs stuff
10:26 < Nnubes256> Me
10:26 < tsunamie> Nnubes256 - you any good with git as I got an issue where I don't trust what the repo says
10:26 < Nnubes256> What it says?
10:27 < tsunamie> I got a nodejs project , having logical issue with git. I have started to try and version control my crap with git. I did the following. I started coding on my local before installing git. I installed got after I had a working copy of my code. I ran the following commands in order. 1> "git init" to state that the local folders are my code base. 2> git add --all to add all the folders and files 
10:27 < tsunamie> in location opt to the repository. 3> git commit -m "Initial Commit of base code" to say this is the first commited trunk. 4> git remote add origin http://test@new.master.server/scm/test/trunk.git to add an origin where I say all the trunk code should be on a remote stash server. Also a central server all my team mates will check shit out from. (or imaginary team mates at the moment). 5> git 
10:27 < tsunamie> push origin master which was me just makign a copy on the remote server. The issue I have no is understanding the commands to do diffd to master as I made changes to my local and want to commit them
10:27 < tsunamie>  however I keep running "git diff origin/master" and it keeps showing me differences. and I keep running "git merge origin/master" and "git push origin master" and it keeps saying "Everything up-to-date"
10:28 < staar2> anyone here use yasmine ?
10:28 < Nnubes256> tsunamie: It's a common messup for Git starters
10:29 < tsunamie> Nubes256 - when I check the remote repository. (or the logical remote master server everyone will pull from) it says my changes not been commited to it
10:29 < Nnubes256> Did you set name and email?
10:29 < tsunamie> Nnubes256 - what am I doing wrong as a starter?
10:29 < tsunamie> yep
10:29 < Nnubes256> How many branches do you have?
10:30 < tsunamie> git config --global user.name "blaaa blaa" and git config --global user.email "boooo@bla.com"
10:30 < tsunamie> numbes256 - none. I only have master (named trunk)
10:30 < tsunamie> how do I check the git username/email took
10:31 < Nnubes256> Try to do git config user.email for check the email put
10:31 < tsunamie> git config --list
10:31 < Nnubes256> Yep, is it correct?
10:32 < tsunamie> list did not show anything for my username and email
10:33 < tsunamie> I just ran the commands and now they show up after reruning config
10:33 < tsunamie> why would that happen?
10:33 < tsunamie> I have it set to Global, so it should not matter which shell instance I start up
10:33 < Nnubes256> Try to do them without the --global flag
10:34 < Nnubes256> And check with git config --list
10:34 < tsunamie> nnumbes256 - no difference. but my username/email address now show up in list
10:35 < tsunamie> but when pushing it still says everything is fine
10:35 < tsunamie> but diffs and the remote repo says the changes not pushed
10:36 < Nnubes256> Check if you set correctly the remotes
10:36 < Nnubes256> Check if you set correctly the remote command
10:36 < tsunamie> git remote -v
10:36 < tsunamie> origin  http://test@remote.serv/scm/cc/trunk.git (fetch)
10:36 < tsunamie> origin  http://test@remote.serv/scm/cc/trunk.git (push)
10:37 < tsunamie> they seem fine
10:37 < tsunamie> I do note the following thow. git push origin master
10:37 < tsunamie> Password for 'http://test@remote.serv':
10:37 < tsunamie> password section does'nt have any reference to the master branch location
10:37 < Nnubes256> Do you know the password?
10:38 < tsunamie> yes
10:38 < tsunamie> thats how I have been able to confirm that remote server does not think any changes have been commited against it
10:42 < Nnubes256> I suppose that, when it says "Password for 'http://test@remote.serv':" is a prompt, yes or not?
10:46 < tsunamie> nnubes256 - got a hit up on the answer I needed to run "git commit -m "My First Commit"" to commit it locally before I could push it
10:46 < Nnubes256> I suppose that, when it says "Password for 'http://test@remote.serv':" is a prompt, yes or not?
10:46 < staar2> with what should i test server side ?
10:47 < shafox> hi, i have a small problem. whenever i am trying to install something from npm i have to give superuser or else it wont install. how can i bypass that cause while setting up my webstorm to create a node project it says the error not enough permission to create dir and thats because of the not giving the sudo before it . how to fix it 
10:47 < shafox> ?
10:47 < Beg> timetocode > https://github.com/tmeasday/page.js/blob/master/index.js
10:47 < Nnubes256> shafox: Use sudo
10:48 < st_luke> shafox: don't use sudo, run chown on the directory
10:48 < asker> hey guys, im new to nodejs and trying to use the redis storage but there is no node_redis or something in the npm registry. somebody got any idea what i have to use?
10:48 < juho_> redis
10:48 < shafox> Nnubes256: yeah using sudo works but is there anyway i can by pass or everytime i want to create a project i would create a package.json then run sudo npm install
10:48 < shafox> st_luke: chown on which dir ??
10:48 < Beg> asker, what juho means is, try npm install redis
10:48 < juho_> yea
10:48 < st_luke> shafox: wherever you're installing
10:48 < juho_> its just called redis
10:49 < r04r> shafox: if you want to use npm to install something globally (-g) use sudo. If it wants sudo when not installing globally you need to fix your permissions. Your directories/folders are likely owned by the wrong user.
10:49 < shafox> r04r: the dir where i am creating the project ??
10:50 < asker> Beg, ty i will try it out. i tested it before and it didnt work :(
10:50 < shafox> I am confused could you please gimme a tut ??
10:50 < r04r> shafox: your initial sudo npm install causes npm to be ran as root in that directory, creating files/folders as root, then of course itll need root in the future to change them
10:50 < r04r> shafox: Learn some basic linux skillz. Google is a master tutor.
10:50 < Beg> you can change the owner with sudo chown -R username:username
10:51 < Beg> usually it's username:group, but usually the username is the group name aswell
10:51 < shafox> r04r, I am creating a new dir under my Home Dir, There if I am doing npm install it shows error . I am the only user in the ubuntu box 
10:52 < shafox> Beg, can i gist here the error ?? 
10:52 < r04r> shafox: You are not the only user to the system. Most interesting in this case is the root user. You mentioned starting a project by doing sudo npm install. That runs npm install as root in that directory, creating node_modules as owned by root and then you are in the situation you are now
10:52 < timetocode> Beg, interesting comment style, thanks for the sample
10:52 < r04r> considering it sounds you haev no clue about permissions, I recommend cd ~; chown -R yourname:yourname yourprojectdirectory
10:54 < shafox> r04r, Beg : https://gist.github.com/shadow-fox/5947865
10:54 < foofoobar> so I want to define a database connection and use this connection in all of my files which I include. How do I do this?
10:54 < foofoobar> do I put this in a file db.js and then do a module.exports = myConnection ?
10:55 < foofoobar> or what is the common way?
10:55 < r04r> shafox: chown -R shafox:shafox /home/shafox/.npm
10:55 < RLa> that's quite good approach
10:56 < Beg> shafox > run this                                      ls -la; ls -la ../         
10:56 < Beg> and post it in gist
10:57 < foofoobar> RLa, okay ;)
10:58 < shafox> Beg, : https://gist.github.com/shadow-fox/5947882
10:58 < Beg> follow what r0ar wrote about the permission with chown -R
10:59 < r04r> also now that i see that ls also do chown -R shafox:shafox /home/shafox/node-gyp
10:59 < r04r> and stop using sudo all the time
10:59 < r04r> you only want to sudo if it wont work without
11:00 < Beg> you only wanna use sudo when you want*(TM)(C)2013 beg
11:02 < shafox> r04r, like when installing globally using sudo advised if without not working then only
11:04 < r04r> shafox: Yeah, pretty much. 
11:06 < Beg> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twqM56f_cVo I want to learn this.
11:08 < staar2> http://pastebin.com/5bF5RhJB
11:08 < staar2> oops >D
11:09 < shafox> r04r, one more question though regarding the permission, isn't /tmp/ dir should have the user permission rather than root ???
11:10 < Beg> that is your home map i believe, you should have full permission over that map
11:10 < Beg> do a sudo chown -R username:username ~
11:10 < Beg> should fix your permissions
11:10 < shafox> Beg, yeah i think so but why does this installed in odd user permission 
11:11 < Beg> because you use sudo npm install rather than sudo npm install -g
11:11 < Beg> so it create the folders where you wanted them with sudo, which gives permissions to root
11:11 < shafox> ook
11:21 < Beg> the a

11:48 < bag-man> I've got a VPS running Ubuntu 12.04, and I can't seem to update nodejs to the latest version (I'm on 0.6); this is annoying as it appears that 0.6 didn't come with npm so I can't install modules! 
11:48 < bag-man> Any idea how I can resolve this? SHould I just install it manually?
11:48 < bag-man> (I don't know why I asked thats the obvious and easiest solution)
11:49 < jcamins> bag-man: There's a PPA, https://launchpad.net/~chris-lea/+archive/node.js/, and npm is a separate package on Ubuntu 12.04, I think.
11:50 < bytephilia> how can I install all required modules with npm?
11:50 < bag-man> jcamins: Ah cool, thanks I shall bear that in mind! If I build it from the source will it have npm? 
11:50 < bytephilia> instead of doing node server.js and installing them one by one as errors pop up
11:51 < jcamins> bag-man: no idea. But I can't imagine why you would want to, either.
11:52 < r04r> bytephilia: list them in your package.json then just do "npm install"
11:52 < r04r> bytephilia: check out https://npmjs.org/doc/json.html especially dependencies
11:52 < bytephilia> ah thanks
11:53 < bag-man> jcamins: Compiling is fun, testing to see if I can remember how to do it right! Plus I started now so I have an excuse to reddit for a few minutes... If it doesn't work I shall do the sensible option you suggested though! Thanks :)
12:10 < bag-man> Compiled and working :D

13:03 < rpcesar> ok, after fiddling around for hours getting a profiler going for node in the 0.10 branch, im now struggling to understand the dang thing. I am trying to analyze a heap snapshot to try to indicate whats consuming so much memory. I understand the concept of weak references and shallow, but I don't understand the unit of measurement being used by the "node-webkit-profiler" (which I presume is the same as would be on chrome given its UI)
13:04 < rpcesar> hitting about 700 MB in a couple minutes and steadily rising (nothing being created in the loop, just a few logs, things created prior though). but the metrics im seeing in the profiler appear too low (if bits) and too high (if bytes)
13:05 < rpcesar> so is this bits? bytes? nibbles? random numbers thrown out of a hat?
13:06 < rpcesar> http://awesomescreenshot.com/0a61hcoje6 thats what im looking at
13:32 < tsunamie> I remember seeing an universal user intergration modaul for nodejs. where y it tries to implement a user object that could store account details for google, facebook and twitter but password was always authenticated against the remote authenticating server
13:32 < tsunamie> does anyone rember the mdoaul name?
13:35 < sCoRpi> tsunamie: http://everyauth.com/ this one?
13:36 < Industrial> Anyone use browserify? I'm trying to require a file that lives in ../../../../lib/foo.js from the path ./lib/helpers.js of the directory I'm executing the browserift command from.
13:36 < Industrial> but thats failing
13:37 < tsunamie> sCopi, yea thats the one
13:38 < jasonkuhrt> how do you people feel about using a client's public key in a TLS server/client setup for looking up the client in a database
13:38 < jasonkuhrt> in other words re-using the client public key as its ID
13:43 < tsunamie> ty
13:44 < r04r> jasonkuhrt: that seems like it could work, but would present problems if you want one user to be able to authenticate using multiple keys
13:45 < jasonkuhrt> r04r: in what practical use-case would you want multiple valid key for one user?
13:46 < r04r> jasonkuhrt: Users connecting from multiple workstations. Just take a look at any git host or authorized_keys file for ssh
13:47 < jcamins> jasonkuhrt: you can already use X.509 certificates in web browsers to authenticate to some sites, so it's done in other contexts.
13:48 < jasonkuhrt> r04r, jcamins: I see, but my use-case is certificates coupled to physicaly hardware products, so I should be fine
13:48 < jasonkuhrt> the public key is physically tied to a piece of hardware
13:48 < jasonkuhrt> embedded on the device memory
13:48 < jasonkuhrt> or storage rather, I guess
13:48 < r04r> jasonkuhrt: Gotcha, then my concerns do not seem relevant for you :)
13:49 < r04r> Still I personally would decouple my authentication scheme from my user store, just in case I want to add additional forms of authentication in the future
13:54 < jasonkuhrt> r04r: thanks for chipping in, helps
14:03 < asker> hey guys, im new to socketio and trying to test stuff. when i send a message to the server, it doesnt emit it on all connected sockets -> http://pastie.org/8121221 what im doing wrong?
14:03 < gdbz> don't use socket.io :(
14:03 < gdbz> Use the native Websocket instead
14:04 < raduu> use socket.io
14:04 < raduu> it s a good wrapper
14:04 < raduu> :)
14:04 < raduu> use socket.broadcast.emit()
14:04 < gdbz> faye-websocket <3
14:06 < r04r> gdbz: What is wrong with socket.io, in your opinion?
14:07 < asker> raduu, ty
14:08 < gdbz> too much shit wrapped around it. Ofcourse the oldbrowser support is okay, but you don't need that anymore =)
14:08 < gdbz> They even implemented their own "protocol"
14:08 < gdbz> ::1 ::2 ::3
14:09 < gdbz> etc
14:09 < raduu> you need IE9
14:09 < gdbz> so?
14:09 < raduu> so how do you make it work?
14:09 < r04r> gdbz: Support for older browsers is still rather important, especially the older IEs (unfortunately). Mobile devices are also interesting, but I do not know how up to date they are with websockets.
14:10 < gdbz> true, but if you build something new, try to avoid it :P
14:11 < r04r> I agree in that if you purely want websockets then socket.io may nto be the best choice, but if you want to "push stuff to the browser easily" then it seems like a fantastic solution
14:36 < baudehlo1> r04r: socket.io sounds great, but fails massively in production. They're trying to re-write it for the next version but it's taking forever and looks like even more layers upon layers. We had to switch to SockJS.
14:37 < r04r> baudehlo1: Interesting, how come it fails massively in production?
14:38 < baudehlo1> I wish I knew. It just did. Client hangs, not switching down to long polling, just basically un-debuggable failures on networks we have no control over. Since switching we've had zero complaints.
14:39 < baudehlo1> I wrote an article about it: http://baudehlo.wordpress.com/2013/05/07/sockjs-multiple-channels-and-why-i-dumped-socket-io/
14:40 < r04r> baudehlo1: Ah, in that way. I'll give your article a read in a bit. You are happy with SockJS however?
14:40 < baudehlo> Yes. Once I overcame the multiple channels issue (which btw apparently Faye provides, but I wanted as lightweight as possible)
14:47 < kenperkins> morning
14:55 < jasonkuhrt> I'm rolling my own plugin middleware system in a node TCP server
14:55 < jasonkuhrt> is there an prior art for this?
14:55 < jasonkuhrt> i.e. connect-like framework for TCP servers?
14:58 < koalallama> jasonkuhrt: express has "middlewares"
14:58 < jasonkuhrt> http://actionherojs.com/ looks like one
14:58 < jasonkuhrt> koalallama: express is built on connect which is built on http, not what I want
14:59 < jasonkuhrt> actionherjs seems to include what I am doing: "actionHero ships with the ability to be a line TCP or TLS server. ..."
15:14 < yshavit> I'm having trouble connecting to a remote mysql instance using node-mysql. I can connect to my local instance just fine, but when I try to connect to the remote host I get ER_ACCESS_DENIED. I'm 99% sure the username and password are correct; I can connect to mysql using those credentials through the mysql client. The password itself contains non-alphanumerics, but when I created a local user with the same password, I was able to connect just fine. It's ju
15:14 < yshavit> the remote host that's giving me trouble. Anyone ever seen this?
15:15 < kenperkins> yshavit: just to confirm, you've connected to remote host from mysql command line from localhost?
15:15 < yshavit> kenperkins: Correct.
15:15 < koalallama> yshavit: do you have a user entry for '%' or specifying the IP of the host your'e connecting from?
15:15 -!- mode/#Node.js [+o isaacs] by ChanServ
15:16 < yshavit> koalallama: Yup.
15:16 < koalallama> from that host, are you able to connect using the mysql client to the remote server?
15:17 < yshavit> koalallama: Yes.
15:17 < yshavit> koalallama: Sorry, misread your first question to me. I have '%', not any specific ip.
15:18 < r04r> yshavit: Sanity check, you have provided host, user and password to mysql.createConnection?
15:19 < koalallama> yshavit: also, does the password ahve any characters that you may have to escape?
15:19 < yshavit> r04r: Yes. And right before that, I spit them out to console.out, so I'm pretty sure they're right.
15:19 < koalallama> perhaps try a simpler password as a test
15:20 < yshavit> koalallama: Unfortunately, I don't have access to the remote host to change passwords.
15:21 < yshavit> Huh, the plot thickens. It seems like things are working fine when I connect through node-mysql through the repl. I must have a typo somewhere… sigh. Sorry guys.
15:23 < yshavit> Yup, found it. Huge mea culpa, I had accidentally supplied "hostname: host" instead of "host: host". r04r's sanity check proved me insane.
15:24 < r04r> yshavit: Happy you figured it out ;-)
15:24 < kenperkins> everyone's done it yshavit 
15:24 < r04r> more than once :(
15:24 < kenperkins> benefits of a dynamically typed language :D
15:25 < yshavit> kenperkins: Ha, I was about to say, this is why I like static typing. ;)
15:25 < kenperkins> remember that next time you add a property to an object on the fly ;)

15:30 < litelci> Hi together, my server is telling me that he can't find the litecli.php file and I have no idea, might some of you guys have a short look into it? :)
15:35 < baudehlo> Sounds like an automated hack. Just ignore it.
15:41 < EGreg> hey guys
15:41 < EGreg> I am trying to do npm install but it didn't install any of the recursive dependencies, why not?
15:42 < EGreg> We have a package.json file but the modules indicated by the downstream package.json don't install
15:42 < EGreg> what to do?
15:42 < statu> EGreg, do you have any error message?
15:44 < EGreg> yes I do
15:44 < statu> EGreg, can you show us? in pastebin, for example

15:51 < EGreg> any ideas?
15:51 < statu> EGreg, can you acces to the web I posted above?
15:53 < bbickerton> With v0.8.21, when making an https.request, is it at all possible for both the 'close' and 'end' events to fire on a single response?
15:54 < EGreg> yes I can
15:54 < EGreg> I can access that
15:55 < EGreg> although the https certificate says not trusted
15:55 < statu> EGreg, yes, but this is normal
15:55 < EGreg> okay so what's going on then?
15:55 < EGreg> http://pastie.org/private/jvffmkvzlvn4vgmuwd6a
15:55 < EGreg> how is that happening
15:55 < EGreg> When I try to run it asks me to install each subdependency because it wasn't installed
15:55 < statu> mm
15:56 < statu> can you post your package.json?
15:56 < EGreg> http://pastie.org/private/riamg9eeuvgdklrice7qw
15:59 < EGreg> so what does that say
15:59 < EGreg> what could be the problem
16:01 < statu> do you have the las version of npm?
16:01 < EGreg> yes
16:03 < statu> EGreg, I don't know :( Have you tested to replace "latest" for * in the package.json file?
16:08 < EGreg> I didn't try ? can try.

17:01  * DougReeder waves hello
17:02 < DougReeder> I've been skimming the Express documentation. Can anyone explain how middleware and routing interact?
17:02 < kenperkins> DougReeder: good question for #express, but I'm pretty sure routing is just another piece of middleware
17:03 < kenperkins> (under the covers)
17:04 < kenperkins> http://expressjs.com/api.html#app.VERB
17:04 < DougReeder> kenperkins , should I be asking how middleware and routing interact for Connect?
17:05 < kenperkins> I think the router is specific to express
17:06  * DougReeder nods
17:10 < DougReeder> I guess I should throw together an Express app with logging statements in middleware and routing callbacks.

17:55 -!- mode/#Node.js [+o piscisaureus_] by ChanServ
17:57 < othiym23> owen1: one thing, though is that the way domainifier.js is supposed to work is to call d.on('error', next); and then use another error handler at the end of the middleware chain
17:57 < othiym23> try that and see if it handles the throw() case properly

18:25 < jasonkuhrt> regarding Q promises
18:25 < jasonkuhrt> and the .finally method
18:25 < jasonkuhrt> quote: "However, if callback returns a promise, the resolution of the returned promise will be delayed until the promise returned from callback is finished."
18:25 < jasonkuhrt> from https://github.com/kriskowal/q/wiki/API-Reference
18:26 < jasonkuhrt> can someone explain this better?
18:28 < icebox> jasonkuhrt, when the callback is finished, the promise gets the state resolved or rejected
18:29 < icebox> jasonkuhrt, only when the callback is finished
18:31 < jasonkuhrt> icebox: where would that promise res or rej be handled in the code? a promise's .then methods have all executed by the time .finally executes?
18:32 < jasonkuhrt> icebox: see what I mean?

18:33 < mordy_> hrm, i'm searching for modern documentation on building a node C++ extension -- any pointers? -- specifically the code is written - it's mainly the build process itself which i'm trying to figure out (there's waf and gyp apparently -- might there be other things?)
18:35 < bnoordhuis> mordy_: there is no waf, only gyp

19:01 < ggomez1973> hi
19:05 < Kakera_> semantics question. If the docs say "the first argument to the callback will be falsy", does that imply that arguments.length >= 1?
19:06 < Kakera_> a more obvious example: if I say that the fifth element of arr is undefined, does that imply that arr.length >= 5?
19:09 < mbalho> Kakera_: 'first argument to the callback will be falsy' means 'callback(false)'
19:10 < Kakera_> mbalho: not at all
19:10 < Kakera_> it might as well be callback('', true, 5)
19:12 < mordy_> hrm; with gyp, how does one define ad-hoc variables (e.g. 'CPPFLAGS' etc.)

19:19 < shafox> has anyone used sailsjs ??
19:19 < wyled> i looked at it
19:19 < wyled> played around with it for a few
19:20 < wyled> but really, i am not looking for all-inclusive frameworks like that. they do not scale well
19:21 < wyled> I miss using a framework where you actually have to code… and use your imagination....
19:21 < wyled> why i am partial to light frameworks like angular, which serve 1 main purpose, making frontend development quicker
19:22 < asdfasd_> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7HhYE_ddtQ&feature=youtu.be
19:22 < wyled> frameworks like express and sails are great for small projects, but don't really cut it in mid-large business
19:23 < wyled> (highly opinionated) :p
19:24 < shafox> wyled: so what would you prefer ?
19:25 < wyled> i compartmentalize my front-end and backend components and serve with a middleware application like nginx or passenger
19:25 < wyled> right now, i am writing my own framework
19:25 < _6a68> wyled: the answer at scale is always, "it depends" :-)
19:25 < wyled> i agree
19:26 < wyled> my statements were purely my opinion and based on the work i'm doing
19:26 < wyled> i think sails is great, for small business or personal projects
19:26 < wyled> it has a nice command line set
19:27 < wyled> i used restify actually
19:27 < wyled> for my backend component
19:27 < shafox> wyled: yeah thats what attracted me but wanted more opinion about large projects
19:28 < Industrial> How do I force npm to install in the current directory, rather then in one above it?
19:28 < shafox> wyled, if you are avoiding express then what middlewares you are using to serve pages and all??
19:28 < Industrial> above the current*
19:28 < wyled> nginx
19:29 < wyled> with AngularJS
19:29 < _6a68> wyled: nginx != express
19:29 < wyled> i serve static HTML with dynamic application javascript
19:29 < Industrial> shafox: what I'm trying to do is ecstatic + shoe (websockets) + dnode (rpc)
19:30 < Industrial> no need for middlewares. you can do everything in the rpc calls
19:30 < wyled> my API server has more than just http requests
19:30 < wyled> so i can connect with multiple devices
19:31 < shafox> my application will have mostly dynamic pages so thought of using backbonejs along with hoganjs for the templating is that good enough? ?
19:32 < wyled> if it is comfortable for you shafox, then yes. that is what i would suggest is just find the components you're satisfied with
19:32 < wyled> there isn't really a right or wrong, and there's so many different frameworks out there
19:33 < shafox> yeah, the frontend part i am done deciding with but about the backend 
19:33 < shafox> thats where i need advice
19:33 < wyled> yea, i couldn't find a solution so i'm making my own. check out restify which is an API server
19:34 < wyled> i'm using that in my new project
19:34 < wyled> but if you need a backend you can always use express or sails
19:34 < wyled> however i find those to be extremely resource intensive
19:35 < shafox> wyled, i need that backend part...

19:45 < dspp> How should I handle scheduled jobs in node?
19:45 < dspp> Crons? Library? setTimeouts?
19:46 < _6a68> dspp: wjat
19:46 < _6a68> shoot, sorry
19:46 < _6a68> dspp: *what is the simplest thing that works for you?
19:46 < dspp> i dont know how viable setTimeouts are, how would that scale and they arent very reliable
19:47 < dspp> basically, i want the most robust way of scheduling background jobs
19:47 < brimstone> what conditions, other than the obvious like stopped process, would cause a setTimeout to fail?
19:47 < dspp> not necessarily the simplest
19:48 < dspp> brimstone: even if it fails, i can add a function that bootstraps the environment and reloads the setTimeouts if the process stops
19:48 < dspp> but what if I have 10000 setTimeouts or more? any issues with that?
19:48 < bevacqua> why would you?
19:48 < dspp> it has to scale with the number of users
19:49 < brimstone> each user has their own event?
19:49 < brimstone> neat
19:49 < dspp> and a user may have many
19:49 < brimstone> ah
19:57 < bradleymeck> dspp: once you start to get variable numbers of timeouts > 100s I would def just move to a track queue and batch jobs or cron
19:58 < dspp> bradleymeck: can you recommend any libraries for working with any of those
19:58 < dspp> im not that familiar with the node ecosystem
19:58 < dspp> and dont want to reinvent the wheel
19:58 < bradleymeck> libraries? not really I just used built in system stuff
20:01 < s5fs> dspp: check out kue, it may be more features than you need but still a pretty neat system
20:02 < s5fs> not really cron-like but may stir up some ideas on how you wish to approach your implementation
20:03 < gistya> Anyone know of a node package for Ajax Ace?
20:03 < dspp> s5fs: yeah, i have heard of kue actually. I don't think it's recurring job functionality is enough. Think I will try to use crons at the system level tbh.
20:06 < dspp> just found later.js for parsing cron syntax, looks nice
20:06 < dspp> can probably use that
20:07 < rossk> there's also node-cron
20:07 < s5fs> dspp: agreed, the recurring stuff is weak, it's a priority queue more than anything else, but i do like jobs living in a db somewhere
20:08 < s5fs> dspp: my only thought with cron is that it can tie you to a single host
20:09 < rossk> s5fs: we pair them together
20:09 < rossk> cron creates the kue jobs
20:09 < rossk> which then can get picked up by any of the kue handlers
20:09 < aandy> if someone was looking for a more indepth architecture layout of scaling, which buzz words would one have to search for? e.g. i know about load balancing at the app level, but how to keep incoming requests from being bottlenecked/single point of failure at the load balancer. there's the "passive" balancing by dns round robin, but that doesn't really help in terms of "what happens if load balancer 1 crashes". i'm not looking for services like cloudflare, i'
20:11 < s5fs> rossk: ah that's really clever
20:11 < rossk> you're still screwed if your cron system goes down
20:11 < rossk> but its been working well for us
20:12 < _6a68> aandy: "distributed systems" might be a start
20:12 < rossk> you _could_ use kue to store your cron jobs
20:12 < rossk> but then that got all meta on my ass
20:12 < s5fs> yo dawg
20:12 < dspp> rossk, thats an interesting approach
20:12 < _6a68> aandy: it's hard to find technical resources taht aren't too academic or too fluffy/high-level/architecty.
20:12 < mordy_> hrm; what version of node is considered "current" ?
20:13 < rossk> thanks dspp
20:13 < aandy> i'm also thinking i should differentiate by metric, as a simple loadbalancer (only) balances cpu/response time/number of open connections. what about bandwith? e.g. you need to serve 200mbit, but your load balancer is bound to 100mbit - how do you tie that together in a "single domain" setup. that sort of thing. not looking for quick answer, more what to search for as i'm not sure what half the terms used are :)
20:13 < mordy_> wondering if i should support 0.8.x
20:13 < aandy> _6a68: alright, thanks
20:13 < _6a68> aandy: 'scalability rules' might be one to look at, it's mostly technical (as opposed to process-heavy) and is sorta? useful
20:14 < aandy> oh that looks interesting
20:14 < b3tamax> +1 for 'scalability rules'. It's not technical. It's quite obvious in places but it's a good read. Seems like good material for project managers.
20:15 < aandy> perfect bed time read ;)
20:17 < serapath> hi, what happens if i require('./directory')?
20:17 < serapath> will it execute all js files in it?
20:17 < r04r> just index.js i think
20:17 < serapath> but the project i checked out has no index.js in it
20:17 < serapath> and i wonder what its doing
20:18 < r04r> then I am not sure
20:18 < r04r> if the project is open source can I take a look?
20:18 < serapath> drywell
20:18 < serapath> yes it is
20:18 < serapath> in app.js it requires('./utilities')
20:18 < serapath> but utilities has three js files in it, but no index.js
20:20 < serapath> https://github.com/jedireza/drywall/
20:20 < serapath> http://jedireza.github.io/drywall/
20:20 < serapath> oh sry
20:20 < serapath> drywall
20:20 < serapath> :D
20:21 < s5fs> serapath: in the same dir as app.js is utilities.js
20:21 < serapath> ? o_O
20:21 < s5fs> serapath: there's also a directory called utilities, so it's kinda confusing, haha
20:21 < serapath> oops
20:21 < serapath> :D
20:21 < serapath> lol, thx
20:21 < serapath> ;-)
20:22 < s5fs> serapath: no problem, i was all confused too, but since it's not my problem i can take a less detailed look. sometimes i think that helps
20:23 -!- mode/#Node.js [+o piscisaureus_] by ChanServ
20:24 < aandy> _6a68 b3tamax: thanks for the recommendation. read through the preface. kindle'd :)
20:26 < serapath> another things i noticed is, that often people use:     exports = module.exports = ...
20:26 < serapath> why the exports = ??
20:26 < thomblake> serapath: Belt and suspenders?  Superstition?
20:27 < serapath> what?
20:27 < aandy> double assign. var one = first_var = numero_uno = 1; console.log(one,first_var,numero_uno); --> 1 1 1
20:27 < serapath> :-)
20:27 < serapath> i know
20:27 < serapath> but whats it good for?
20:27 < thomblake> Absolutely nothing
20:27 < aandy> war
20:27 < bradleymeck> commonjs, original module spec required an exports object to exist, node added module.exports as a way to do singleton exports...
20:28 < serapath> so will there be situations where the 'exports =' will have an effect?
20:28 < aandy> well, the double assign you pasted... dunno. backwards compatibility maybe
20:28 < serapath> ok, so normally it should be save to remove it, right?
20:28 < thomblake> Yes, if you need to interact with non-Node stuff that expects exports.
20:28 < serapath> i dont
20:28 < serapath> thx :-)
20:28 < aandy> serapath: actually, the reason is: http://stackoverflow.com/a/7142924
20:30 < aandy> so, properties vs. object, basically
20:30 < aandy> and conflict
20:32 < ngl> how would I find what version of mysql-libmysqlclient will work on Centos 5.8? If I just npm install it there are a bunch of related dependencies that there are no rpms for, for Centos 5.7. 
20:37 < sinclair|net> what do people here think about JIT compilation on node?
20:46 < mordy_> how can you define extra parameters for gyp via npm?
20:47 <@TooTallNate> mordy_: they end up as "gyp variables" that you can use in your binding.gyp
20:48 <@TooTallNate> mordy_: so say you do `npm install mymodule --with-some-option
20:48 < mordy_> ahh ok
20:48 < pierre1> Hi! What's the proper way of handling dev and production environment variables in a node.js app?
20:48 <@TooTallNate> mordy_: then `with_some_option` would be a gyp variable
20:48 < pierre1> I'm using express and heroku
20:48 < mordy_> hrm; seems to work
20:50 < spobat> hi
20:50 < spobat> how can i start the node server in tha background, so that I can close the terminal thereafter?
20:50 < spobat> I currently use "node server.js"
20:50 < pierre1> use & disown after the command
20:51 < spobat> node & server.js did not work :s
20:51 < pierre1> $ node server.js & disown
20:51 < spobat> ah
20:51 < spobat> is disown part of node?
20:51 < pierre1> no, it's part of unix, I reckon
20:51 < thomblake> spobat: part of bash
20:51 < spobat> alrighty
20:51 < pierre1> bash, ok :P
20:52 < mordy_> hrm; now where exactly does it install the module?
20:52 < spobat> so the & is always on the back of a command?
20:52 < pierre1> yes
20:52 < spobat> I thought it should be right after the program doing stuff
20:52 < spobat> like "node & foo"
20:52 < pierre1> no
20:52 < spobat> okay, thank you
20:52 < pierre1> Because what you pass after the command is the argument for it
20:53 < pierre1> so in "node & disown server.js" you would pass server.js as an argument to disown
20:53 < mordy_> i remember the old waf stuff would but it inside ~/.node_libraries
20:53 < pierre1> spobat, and node wouldn't know what to execute
20:53 < mordy_> but now the only place i can find it is at ./build/Debug/whatever.node
20:54 < spobat> pierre1: got it
20:54 < mordy_> maybe i should upgrade.. but i don't see why this should be broken
21:00 < mordy_> how do i make npm not skip symbolic links?
21:03 < rcd> If I create an object with: "var foo = new Foo();" is there a reason why foo.prototype is undefined? I thought the new operator caused foo.prototype to be Foo.prototype?
21:04 < mbalho> foo.__proto__
21:06 < rcd> mbalho: thanks, where does the __proto__ come from? is that a node convention? a javascript thing? Excuse my ignorance. I just haven't seen that before
21:06 < mbalho> rcd: its part of the ECMAScript specification
21:06 < bradleymeck> Object.getPrototypeOf(foo)
21:06 < bradleymeck> it sadly is part of a spec draft, i hope we go setPrototype of rather than scary magic properties
21:06 < bradleymeck> its in most browsers, as well as in node
21:11 < dmilith> isaacs: https://gist.github.com/dmilith/5952521
21:13 < dmilith> it's not panic
21:13 < dmilith> it's just oops, after which everything works except node
21:14 < dmilith> I'm just curious about your experience
21:14 < dmilith> it's the "stable" patch of GrSecurity
21:14 <@tjfontaine> oh, grsecurity
21:14 < dmilith> yes. I explitictly mentioned about it
21:14 < dmilith> in description
21:14 < staar2> whats wrong here      Error: expected '07-06 16:48' to equal '07-06 16:48' ?
21:15 < mawk_> HAI GUISE NE1 WANT TO USE MY CHAT APP ON GITHUB
21:15 < mawk_> on a serious note, is it me or does mongoose just suck?
21:23 < willwh> mawk_: quantify
21:23 < willwh> or you just sound like a hipster
21:23 < willwh> :P
21:32 < dmilith> ehh that's why bsd > linux
21:38 < qard> Yes, mongoose sucks.
21:38 < qard> Specifically, relations in mongoose suck.
21:48 < NotMyself> what are folks using for production monitoring solutions?
21:48 < wc-> what kind of monitoring?
21:48 < NotMyself> im used to using new relic
21:48 < wc-> newrelic has a nodejs monitor in beta
21:48 < baudehlo> is there a way under cluster to stop server.listen() being the cluster version? I genuinely need the client to do the listen(), and want listen without a port to genuinely give me a random port each time.
21:48 < wc-> pingdom for checking uptime
21:48 < NotMyself> yeah i talked to the guy running it but he said they were not accepting new folks ATM
21:49 < wc-> really?
21:49 < NotMyself> that was over a week ago so maybe it has changed
21:49 < NotMyself> i hit him up right after NodePDX
21:49 < wc-> what if you make a newrelic account and just install the nodejs package yourself
21:49 < gkatsev> substack: is it possible to demand one of two boolean options using optimist?
21:49 < wc-> https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic/
21:49 < neeky> AAA_awright, check out this masterpiece: http://www.regex101.com/r/wD0pH2 
21:49 < wc-> i think you can still use it you just cant get tech support
21:50 < neeky> my invoice number formatting tokenizer
21:50 < NotMyself> ill give it a try
21:50 < neeky> any sequence outputs a comma delimited string of tokens, with which a simple split will give me all the components
21:51 < neeky> I think you were the one that helped me come up with the formatting string 
21:51 < neeky> but I didn't have a flexible way to tokenize it
21:54 < neeky> Mongoose is what it is. refs work fine for what I'm using them for
21:55 < neeky> I have decided relationships are business logic, not model logic, so outside of simple _id references, I do it in code
21:55 < neeky> but that's me, and I'm 1 IQ point above being on disability, so YMMV
21:56 < neeky> I'm the Forrest Gump of programming
21:57 < rossk> Mongoose is like a box of chocolates... you'll never know what you'll get
21:59 < cTIDE> i never understood the point of mongoose
21:59 < cTIDE> if i wanted to define a schema, i'd use a database that supported it
22:00 < piklu> Hi Guys
22:00 < piklu> Would u mind having a cheaper but not HA redis service?
22:07 < jalcine> how do I set configuration options for Jade in Express?
22:12 < gkatsev> substack: figured it out using .check
22:13 < zeekay> so what's the most popular gui toolkit for node? appjs?
22:14 < substack> gkatsev: I just use if () {} for that nowadays
22:14 < substack> optimist has too many features
22:14 < substack> http://npmjs.org/package/minimist
22:14 < gkatsev> haha
22:29 < neeky> not what a gui toolkit is, but I use html, bootstrap, jquery, and backbone.js to build guis for node 
22:29 < howdynihao> zeekay: there's also https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit
22:30 < zeekay> yeah i was just looking at that
22:30 < zeekay> looks pretty good, might go with this
22:31 < jesusabdullah> node-webkit is just really really big
22:31 < jesusabdullah> is all
22:31 < jesusabdullah> I wanna try that brackets shell thing
22:31 < zeekay> link?
22:31 < jesusabdullah> someone should try it for me and tell me if it's any good
22:31 < zeekay> i might
22:31 < b0k0r> hi all
22:31 < jesusabdullah> zeekay: https://github.com/adobe/brackets-shell
22:32 < zeekay> thanks
22:32 < zeekay> what is CEF3
22:32 < mordy_> so i've been having performance issues with my C++ extension; presumably it's touching v8 too much and the cost for calling into/out from C is too high; i was thinking about actually establishing a pipe of some sort, where the extension would "listen" for invocations and "send" response data, and the rest of the code would be in pure javascript
22:33 < mordy_> any tips/pointers for optimizing existing code to not be so slow (preferrably some post somewhere)
22:33 < zeekay> chromium embedded framework
22:33 < zeekay> hm
22:33 < Industrial> 1) What's currently the best javascript minifier (I can't define 'better'.)? 2) Will minifying code impact speed (negatively)? 3) if library A and library B have the same functions could you have them use one in the result?
22:33 < howdynihao> Industrial: no point to minify nodejs code
22:33 < jesusabdullah> Industrial: 1) there are quite a few, uglify's not bad
22:34 < jesusabdullah> Industrial: it may increase speed slightly.
22:34 < Industrial> howdynihao: I want this for browserified bundles in production, though.
22:34 < piklu> piklu: Would a cheap but not HA redis service is something that would be welcome?
22:34 < jesusabdullah> Industrial: Yeah, just pipe your bundles through fuglify and call it a day.
22:34 < zeekay> esmangle is also pretty good
22:35 < zeekay> esmangle and uglify-js2 each have a few different optimizations iirc
22:35 < piklu> anyone ?????
22:35 < zeekay> i've used both before to shave an extra few percent of minified size
22:36 < zeekay> uglify-js2 can use spidermonkey ast, so you can pipe mangled ast from esmangle -> uglify-js2
22:38 < Industrial> jesusabdullah: ok
22:40 < jesusabdullah> what is an HA?
22:40 < zeekay> high availibility
22:42 < piklu> jesusabdullah: seriously ?? 
22:44 < jesusabdullah> piklu: Seriously.
22:44 < piklu> jesusabdullah: lol
22:44 < piklu> jesusabdullah: :)
22:44 < piklu> jesusabdullah: what do u say ? a cheaper redis service can be sold?
22:45 < piklu> jesusabdullah: I am building the UI for the panels right now
22:45 < jesusabdullah> piklu: It's cool, I'll hit you up with a pile of construction lingo someday
22:45 < jesusabdullah> piklu: I mean, I'm an ultra cheapskate and not looking to run a business so I'm the wrong person to ask
22:45 < piklu> jesusabdullah: Ultra cheap stake?
22:45 < piklu> I think you are a very great programmer
22:45 < astropriate> don't lie to him
22:45 < astropriate> he won't improve if you do
22:45 < jesusabdullah> nope, cheapskate.
22:46 < zeekay> haha
22:46 < mbalho> jesusabdullah: you are top sirloin to me
22:46 < astropriate> jk, I just got here and don't knwo who you are talking to
22:46 < jesusabdullah> Don't worry guys, my self esteem is so low nothing you can say will convince me that I don't need to learn anymore
22:46 < zeekay> tri-tip top even
22:46 < jesusabdullah> mbalho: <3
22:46 < astropriate> HAHAHA
22:47 < alasi> Hey, does heroku require a favicon? Because my error logs say this:
22:47 < alasi> at=error code=H10 desc="App crashed" method=GET path=/favicon.ico
22:47 < jesusabdullah> now if you'll excuse me, I have a bucket of froyo to drown myself in
22:47 < Zaxnyd> HAHAHA = HIGH AVAILABILITY HIGH AVAILABILITY HIGH AVAILABILITY 
22:47 < alasi> So do I have to supply a favicon to get my goddarn app to work? :P
22:47 < jesusabdullah> Zaxnyd++
22:47 < zeekay> i design all my apps HAHAHA
22:47 < astropriate> HAHAHA
22:47 < jesusabdullah> the highest of availabilities.
22:47 < zeekay> HAHAHA is where it's at man
22:47 < alasi> ....
22:47 < zeekay> H&A motherfucker
22:47 < zeekay> mostly H though
22:47 < zeekay> working on A
22:47 < Zaxnyd> lol jesusabdullah 
22:48 < jesusabdullah> well after drug testing anyway
22:48 < piklu> No one has yet answered me - I have a 196 GB memory machine lying idle in a data center closer to nodejitus - here I am to ask people, and community doesn't helps me out
22:48 < jesusabdullah> OHOHOHO
22:48 < jesusabdullah> piklu: I honestly don't know!
22:48 < zeekay> give me 192GB
22:48 < piklu> zeekay : most welcome, rent the entire as managed….I am happy
22:48 < jesusabdullah> right
22:48 < jesusabdullah> brb froyo
22:48 < astropriate> I am using the handlebars from NPM and trying to log using {{log "dfsdfSD"}}  helper (the way it is on the home page of the project) and it is doing absolutely nothing
22:48 < astropriate> any ideas?
22:49 < astropriate> piklu, what is your question?
22:49 < alasi> Does anyone know the answer to my question? :P
22:50 < piklu> astropriate: I am willing to begin a redis hosted service - it will not have HA, but it is very cheap, 1GB @ 10 USD……Can it be sold ?
22:50 < astropriate> alasi, it seems it is your app that is messed up
22:50 < alasi> Yeah
22:50 < alasi> It doesnt have a favicon
22:50 < astropriate> instead of issuying a normal 404, it is crashing
22:50 < astropriate> issuing*
22:50 < alasi> Oh
22:50 < alasi> I didn't implement a favicon or error system in my app
22:51 < astropriate> well favicon is no exception
22:51 < astropriate> it should never ever crash on a  "route not found"
22:51 < alasi> So I need to expressify an error handler?
22:51 < astropriate> alasi, sorry never used it
22:51 < astropriate> but you shouldn't need an error handler
22:52 < alasi> huh
22:52 < astropriate> I would do a "Catch all" route
22:52 < astropriate> that is a wildcard regex
22:52 < alasi> Sorry, no experience...
22:52 < piklu> astropriate: It will be a virtual instance completely for one redis ( rather than shared one ) 
22:52 < astropriate>  for example /*
22:52 < astropriate> piklu, There is another service that does this,though they are a bit pricey
22:52 < alasi> Sorry, I dont really know how I would right that
22:52 < astropriate> but here is the issue I took with them:
22:53 < alasi> Maybe..
22:53 < piklu> astropriate: 4-5 service do it. They are all very pricey, I am thinking of offering 1GB @ 10 USD memory
22:53 < mordy_> how do i configure node from source to install the headers?
22:53 < astropriate> You use redis, because it is fast. You use it because you don't use too much of system resources. You hit the system memory because it is FAST. Now, you loose ALL benefits to that because you have to travel over the internet
22:53 < astropriate> even in the same datacenter, it would be questionable
22:54 < astropriate> let alone over the internet
22:54 < piklu> I am at 4ms from nodejitsu
22:54 < piklu> astropriate: I can also think of offering a node.js and a redis combined pair…..like node.js and redis both in your web server.
22:54 < piklu> astropriate: How and why these services are growing ?
22:54 < astropriate> piklu, lets PM 
22:54 < piklu> astropriate: Hi
22:57 < mordy_> ahh.. i see, they're handled by npm
22:57 < mordy_> still it would be nice to have the headers in a single placwe
22:57 < mordy_> so one could use an IDE and browse the code
22:57 < alasi> A tutorial said I should gitignore the node_modules directory
22:57 < alasi> ..
22:57 < jesusabdullah> alasi: good idea
22:58 < mbalho> alasi: http://www.futurealoof.com/posts/nodemodules-in-git.html
22:58 < alasi> now I'm getting errors socketio is undefined, so I probably have to declare that package in the package.json..
23:00 < alasi> Should I put ""socket.io": "9.x.x"" in package.json?
23:01 < jesusabdullah> probably alasi 
23:01 < alasi> alright
23:02 < keenan> hello everyone. I am here asking for some advice
23:03 < NotMyself> PROTIP: if npm install is not working.. its not npm… did a teammate possibly shrinkwrap the project and not let anyone know?
23:03 < NotMyself> Addendum: save yourself the reboot...
23:03 < alasi> jesusabdullah: seems it should be 0.9.x
23:03 < alasi> actually
23:04 < keenan> I have a node service that runs on a bunch of computers. I also have a master node program that I want to run on demand. I want this master to send a command to a bunch of clients and then wait for responses. Does anyone have any suggestions for protocols or libraries that would help me out?
23:05 < s5fs> keenan: http?
23:05 < rconover> Guys, I've created a local git branch to do a patch, but I'm having trouble committing my changes to the remote v0.10 branch so I can do a pull request?
23:05 < howdynihao> anyone a ios developer want to register me :x
23:05 < rconover> Anybody know the right git command to do?
23:06 < keenan> s5fs: Yeah that is what I was thinking
23:06 < howdynihao> rconover you create your own branch
23:06 < keenan> I just didn't know if there was anything better
23:06 < rconover> okay did that
23:06 < rconover> and committed to it
23:06 < s5fs> keenan: 'better' is a relative term, i don't know your constraints etc so i just threw the obvious solution out there.
23:07 < alasi> huh
23:07 < alasi>  Web process failed to bind to $PORT within 60 seconds of launch
23:07 < alasi> Well my port is 8080
23:07 < alasi> Ah thats why
23:07 < howdynihao> http isn't bidirectional though
23:08 < howdynihao> unless you use like spdy or websockets or something
23:08 < alasi> websockets
23:08 < keenan> I've been using zmq
23:08 < alasi> howdynihao: you talking to me, right?
23:08 < keenan> but it gets kinda messy to manage a lot of connections
23:08 < howdynihao> no keenan
23:09 < alasi> oh
23:09 <@MI6> joyent/node: Trevor Norris master * ead8e26 : smalloc: call callback if set on AllocDispose (+1 more commits) - http://git.io/73n9ag
23:13 < zeekay> spdy is bidirectional?
23:15 < rconover> sure just like http is
23:15 < howdynihao> no but at least you can do puish
23:19 < pierre1> Hi. How are you? I'm trying to access some req attributes, but most of them are undefined. For example, req.host, req.ip etc
23:19 < pierre1> Are these attributes exclusive to express?
23:19 < brettlangdon> pierre1, need a little more context
23:21 < pierre1> I'm using node.js and express
23:21 < pierre1> Inside my view, I'm trying to get some req attributes (like req.ip, req.host), as documented here http://expressjs.com/api.html#req.params
23:21 < astropriate> I am using the handlebars from NPM and trying to log using {{log "dfsdfSD"}}  helper (the way it is on the home page of the project) and it is doing absolutely nothing. Any ideas?
23:21 < pierre1> But most of them are undefined. Do you know what's up?
23:22 < pierre1> brettlangdon, by express I mean express.js
23:23 < brettlangdon> pierre1, I am not sure why that would be happening, do you have an example of the code? maybe `req` isn't being passed into the view properly?
23:24 < captain_morgan> Anyone aware of a large, publicly available, json endcoded levelDB?r
23:25 < pierre1> brettlangdon, let me see...
23:26 < mbalho> captain_morgan: wzrd.in is browserify-cdn, not a ton of data in it yet though
23:27 < SomeoneWeird> pierre1, you need to explicitly pass req into the view when you render it
23:27 < pierre1> oh, by view I mean a controller
23:27 < captain_morgan> mbalho, sorry, wasn't looking for a large use case, looking for an actual database directory to run some benchmarks on
23:27 < captain_morgan> will probably get generate a large dataset
23:27 < pierre1> or the function that gets called when a certain page is requested
23:28 < SomeoneWeird> >_>
23:28 < pierre1> that's the Django way, mixed it up
23:28 < SomeoneWeird> need some code or else we can't help
23:28 < SomeoneWeird> app.get('/url', function(req, res) { console.log(req) });
23:28 < SomeoneWeird> put that somewhere and see if it works
23:29 < mbalho> captain_morgan: if you npm install browserify-cdn -g and then run it and then install a bunch of packages with it then you'll have a good test case :D
23:29 < pierre1> ...
23:30 < captain_morgan> mbalho, great, I will have a look
23:30 < pierre1> what I'm saying is: wasn't this "app.get('/url', function(req, res) { console.log(req.ip) });" supposed to work?
23:31 < pierre1> meaning, according to this (http://expressjs.com/api.html#req.params) shouldn't req.ip be a valid attribute?
23:31 < brettlangdon> pierre1, theoretically, but if you do "console.dir(req);" then you can see what the req object is that is being passed in as a way to help debug the issue
23:32 < pierre1> the req object being passed is the right one, it's got some other attributes it's supposed to have, but not req.ip, for example
23:32 < pierre1> why is that?
23:34 < pierre1> brettlangdon, using console.dir is giving me the same results
23:35 < pierre1> brettlangdon, ip doesn't show up
23:35 < brettlangdon> pierre1, I just tested myself and am getting the same result, there might be some middleware that is needed to parse those variables (possibly)
23:37 < brettlangdon> pierre1, what version of express do you have?
23:38 < pierre1> brettlangdon, the latest one
23:38 < brettlangdon> I just checked the source for 3.3.4 which is the latest and ip and host are there but they are defined as getters and setters on the request object
23:39 < brettlangdon> this works fine for me: https://gist.github.com/brettlangdon/5953407
23:40 < pierre1> lol, I'm far far away from the latest one
23:40 < pierre1> that's it, then
23:40 < brettlangdon> :)
23:40 < pierre1> brettlangdon, thank you so much :)
23:40 < brettlangdon> pierre1, no problem
23:41 < brettlangdon> if you *cant* upgrade to the latest for some reason, there are other ways to get those properties
23:45 < alasi> What's the syntax for doing app.get('/', etc) if I do: "app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public'));"
23:47 < chiel> anyone using flatiron's directory/union and know if there's something to parse array-style posted form data? i mean fields that look like `bla[0]` etc
23:50 < alasi> DAFUQ and now it thinks I'm using RUBY!
