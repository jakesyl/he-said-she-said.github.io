00:01 < _6a68> chiper: oh nice!
00:09 < d4rklit3> i think i found a bug in path.extname
00:09 < d4rklit3> if the req.path is "/js/"  i get back .js
00:10 < bnoordhuis> d4rklit3: > path.extname('/js/')
00:10 < bnoordhuis> ''
00:11 < d4rklit3> fuck..
00:11 < d4rklit3> how was i getting .js
00:11 < d4rklit3> now it stopped
00:11 < d4rklit3> i must be high
00:11 < _6a68> there it is
00:50 < d4rklit3> substack, how does browserify know what folder to look at for all the source files?
00:50 < d4rklit3> .add looks like wants one file
00:51 -!- mode/#Node.js [+o TooTallNate] by ChanServ
01:15 < fiws> POST "/files/:file/update" or  "/files/update/:file" for REST
01:16 < fiws> ?
01:17 <@isaacbw> if you really want it to be RESTful, don't put a verb in the url
01:18 < fiws> so PATCH /files/:file ?
01:18 <@isaacbw> probably POST
01:18 <@isaacbw> but don't get caught up with being super RESTful. Just do what works
01:19 < fiws> what do you prefer?
01:19 <@isaacbw> what do you mean
01:20 < fiws> "/files/:file/update" or  "/files/update/:file" or just POST /file/:file
01:20 <@isaacbw> probably just POST/file/:file
01:23 < d4rklit3> does node run elevated in windows?
01:26 < mscdex> d4rklit3: depends, are you lifting your computer?
01:27 <@isaacbw> you gotta use it or lose it
01:28 < d4rklit3> can i not do this?
01:28 < d4rklit3> http://pastie.org/7950965
01:28 < d4rklit3> (its in coffee)
01:28 < d4rklit3> i get no error or data from that
01:28 < ssafejava> d4rklit3: "String" is not an encoding
01:29 < d4rklit3> utf8
01:29 < d4rklit3> doesn't work either
01:29 < d4rklit3> default does not work.. the thing is, my server files taht run thsi code are not at the root of my project folder
01:30 < d4rklit3> i have /server/*.js   files where all the code is 
01:30 < ssafejava> sure. you can work back up the tree with ../, that's fine
01:30 < d4rklit3> yeah i thought so... but i can't read that file.... i can't explain why :(
01:31 < ssafejava> idk, best I can say is to go to that directory in a console and `cat ../source/apps/boty-site/main.coffee` to be sure your path is correct
01:31 < ssafejava> & drop the encoding options
01:31 < d4rklit3> what is cat
01:31 < ssafejava> reads out the contents of a file
01:32 < d4rklit3> yes
01:32 < ssafejava> try dropping the path.normalize
01:33 < d4rklit3> ok there we go
01:34 < d4rklit3> it comes in as <Buffer hex values... >
01:34 < d4rklit3> but its a text file
01:34 < d4rklit3> i set encoding to utf8, same thing.
01:34 < syncan> toString() it?
01:34 < sgarbesi> in the JS browsers world prototypes are much faster/consume less memory than objects. does the same ring true for node ?
01:34 < d4rklit3> yes taht works
01:35 < ssafejava> sgarbesi: yes, same language, same runtime
01:35 <@isaacbw> sgarbesi: node uses v8 which is chrome's js runtime
01:35 < d4rklit3> well at least i know the file exists, however browserify is def not reading it
01:35 < ssafejava> use prototypes when it makes sense
01:35 < d4rklit3> but thats probably because im using it wrong :(
01:35 < sgarbesi> I'm trying to see when/why it would never make sense
01:35 < ssafejava> depends on what you're doing... I think you're confused when you say they use 'less memory than objects'
01:36 < sgarbesi> ssafejava: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3493252/javascript-prototype-operator-performance-saves-memory-but-is-it-faster
01:36 < sgarbesi> thoughts?
01:37 < sgarbesi> i spent a few weeks coming up with my whole backend, now I'm going through cleaning it up and optimizing, and having the debate atm on whether i should switch all my model objects to prototypes
01:37 < ssafejava> Ah. Your phrasing was off imo, obviously all of these things are objects
01:37 < ssafejava> and no, I think that sort of optimization is wildly unnecessary
01:38 < ssafejava> Unless you're instantiating thousands of them
01:38 < sgarbesi> can you sell me on why not to switch to prototypes?
01:38 < sgarbesi> case by example/scenario, per every page hit i'm spawning a session object/prototype per user
01:40 < sgarbesi> ssafejava: http://jsperf.com/prototype-vs-object-creation
01:40 < sgarbesi> safe to say that it really does make the difference?
01:43 < ssafejava> I disagree, I don't think that's really a fair comparison at all. The prototype creation essentially creates a single object, assigns its prototype to core.prototype, and is done. The second iterates through an array, checks hasOwnProperty, etc.
01:44 < ssafejava> In any case, something that runs at the rate of 4mil/sec isn't going to be the bottleneck in your app
01:44 <@isaacbw> yea, that's a pretty funky comparison
01:44 < sgarbesi> it's mimicking Object.create no?
01:45 < sgarbesi> isn't that exactly what object.create is doing?
01:47 < ssafejava> Object.create simply sets the prototype in most implementations, yeah
01:50 < ssafejava> I say the optimization is not worth it because it's still a fast operation compared to most. If you're trying to eke out the last 1% of performance, it might help, but only a profiler can tell you that for sure. I would imagine a very very small amount of your program's time is spent instantiating objects
01:51 < d4rklit3> substack, can browserify still read all files from a directory and bundle them? 
01:51 < d4rklit3> i dont see this functionality anymore, anywhere
01:51 < styol> >> var err = new Error('uh oh'); if (err.toString() === 'uh oh') { 'is this the proper approach?'; }
01:51 < purr> styol: undefined
01:53 < styol> >> var err = new Error('uh oh'); if (err.toString() === 'uh oh') console.log('is this the proper approach?';
01:53 < styol> crap
01:53 < purr> styol: SyntaxError: Unexpected token ;
01:54 <@isaacbw> styol: no
01:54 -!- mode/#Node.js [+o piscisaureus_] by ChanServ
01:55 < styol> isaacbw: outside of the missing ), what is the recommended approach?
01:56 <@isaacbw> if you want to respond to multiple types of errors, use instanceof
01:59 < styol> isaacbw: but won't instanceof only tell me that the err is an instance of Error? I want to evaluate which error specifically
01:59 < styol> perhaps a code or something would be better, but previously I was not able to figure out how to do that. A module I'm using that is returning new Error objects somehow is doing it though
02:00 <@isaacbw> styol: so you create your own error type
02:00 < styol> ah, makes sense
02:01 <@isaacbw> most people don't do that with js though
02:01 <@isaacbw> js developers aren't big on error handling
02:02 < ChrisPartridge> styol: you can also attach properties to existing error objects, if you want to keep things simple
02:04 < styol> isaacbw: what if you can't make your own error type? I forgot that in this instance it is this module previously referred to that is using Error specifically. They are providing a code though (like err.code) which is what I should be using actually, but I was  more just curious
02:04 < styol> ChrisPartridge: just out of curiosity, how dat? extending it with prototype?
02:05 < mscdex> err.foo = 'bar';
02:06 < styol> hrm yeah that does seem to work, not sure what i was smoking previously
02:08 < styol> >> var err = new Error('uh oh'); err.code = 123; throw err;
02:08 < purr> styol: Error: uh oh
02:09 < mscdex> >> var err = new Error('lol'); err.code = 123; console.dir(err);
02:09 < purr> mscdex: TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'dir'
02:09 < mscdex> aw
02:10 < mscdex> >> var err = new Error('lol'); err.code = 123; Object.keys(err);
02:10 < purr> mscdex: (object) ['code']
02:10 < mscdex> \o/
02:10 < ChrisPartridge> ^5
02:10 < deoxxa> >> var MyError = function MyError(str, code) { Error.call(this, str); this.code = code; }; MyError.prototype = Object.create(Error.prototype); var err = new MyError("lol", 123); err;
02:10 < purr> deoxxa: (object) {code: 123}
02:10 < mscdex> >> var err = new Error('lol'); err.code = 123; console.log(err);
02:10 < purr> mscdex: undefined; Console: {arguments: undefined, code: 123, message: 'lol', stack: (Getter/Setter), type: undefined}
02:10 < mscdex> there we go
02:10 < ChrisPartridge> node-stackvis is pretty sweet
02:10 < styol> damn, I'm all used to simple stuff like -- if (err) return callback(new Error('uh oh')); though haha
02:11 < mscdex> styol: you can do like deoxxa just showed too
02:11 < styol> that is pretty cool, didn't see that
02:11 < styol> thanks deoxxa
02:11 < mscdex> styol: or just make your own makeError() function that does it for you. then it's just `if (err) return callback(makeError('foo', 123));`
02:12 < deoxxa> yep
02:12 < deoxxa> plenty of ways to do it
02:12 < styol> delicious
02:12 < styol> I'm learnding!
02:12 < deoxxa> what's a battle?
02:13 < d4rklit3> i would like to learn something
02:13 < d4rklit3> im doing everything in browserify correct... except as middleware it just doesn't want to work
02:13 < ChrisPartridge> d4rklit3: error? code? gist?
02:13 < d4rklit3> can you read coffee?
02:14 < deoxxa> i'm better with reading tea
02:14 < ssafejava> lol. just post the gist
02:14 < d4rklit3> here it is
02:14 < d4rklit3> http://pastie.org/7951090
02:14 < k_sze[work]> I have a problem using grunt.
02:14 < deoxxa> surprise surprise though, something involving coffeescript isn't working properly
02:15 < rcs> k_sze[work]: A philosophical problem?
02:15 < d4rklit3> deoxxa lol yeah who knows
02:15 <@isaacbw> that's not coffeescript
02:15 < k_sze[work]> Somehow it says there is a problem with my package.json, but it won't even tell me which line.
02:15 < ssafejava> deoxxa: ^_^
02:15 < ssafejava> k_sze[work]: what's the exact error?
02:15 <@isaacbw> k_sze[work]: it probably isn't formatted right
02:15 < deoxxa> ^ this, what's the error
02:15 < k_sze[work]> Unexpected token ]
02:16 < deoxxa> yep, it's a typo
02:16 < ssafejava> well... cmd-F ] and find it :)
02:16 < deoxxa> guessing it's a trailing comma
02:16 < d4rklit3> ChrisPartridge you see anything wrong>
02:16 < d4rklit3> ?
02:16 < k_sze[work]> But if I copy the content of package.json and stick it in Chrome's console, it creates an Object with no issue.
02:17 <@isaacbw> ...
02:17 < d4rklit3> the problem i have is that b is different in the middleware function than when its created
02:17 < k_sze[work]> shall I pastebin the package.json?
02:17 < deoxxa> k_sze[work]: chrome's console is a javascript console, not a json console
02:17 < ssafejava> probably an unquoted key
02:17 < deoxxa> k_sze[work]: javascript !== json
02:18 < k_sze[work]> I know, but I assume they should be similar enough. If I restrict to strings, [], and {}, then I should be fine, no?
02:19 <@isaacbw> just paste the json
02:19 <@isaacbw> and don't assume
02:19 < ssafejava> post the pastebin, & yes, there's not much difference
02:19 <@isaacbw> you can't just assume things and throw your hands up when they don't work
02:20 < k_sze[work]> http://pastebin.com/kUGLCgL0
02:20 < ssafejava> i see it
02:20 < ssafejava> line 6, extra comma
02:20 < ckknight> k_sze[work]: http://jsonlint.com/
02:21 < ssafejava> JSON & IE choke hard on commas at the end of arrays/objs
02:21 <@isaacbw> lots of extra commas
02:21 < ssafejava> if you use something like ST2, get a linter
02:21 <@isaacbw> http://json.org/ json is stricter than js
02:23 < k_sze[work]> ssafejava: IE8+ seem to do fine, IIRC.
02:24 < ssafejava> it's a good idea to run a linter to catch those, you don't want your app to break hard just b/c of a comma.
02:29 < noobee> is there anybody here who ever has problem like this: Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND
02:29 < noobee> is this a network problem?
02:30 < ChrisPartridge> noobee: probably a dns lookup failure
02:30 < ChrisPartridge> afaik
02:30 < noobee> how can i solved this
02:30 < syncan> are you able to ping the domain / ip?
02:30 < noobee> im working inside vpn
02:31 < noobee> no
02:31 < noobee> but sometimes i can connect without getting that error
02:31 < noobee> i tried to clear dns cache 
02:31 < syncan> sounds like an infrastructure issue with your VPN provider
02:32 < noobee> like doing this dscacheutil -flushcache  
02:32 < bmatusiak_> ive been getting "npm ERR! cb() never called!"  quite a bit... is this a bug?
02:32 < syncan> what do you get from doing a host "name" ?
02:32 < syncan> is it multiple ips?
02:33 < syncan> it's possible that it's round-robin-ing, and there's a server down
02:33 < bmatusiak_> idk it happens during heroku push
02:33 < noobee> when i do hostname it gives me my local domain
02:33 < noobee> like something.local
02:34 < syncan> you want ips
02:34 < syncan> akin to "host" 
02:34 -!- mode/#Node.js [+o TooTallNate] by ChanServ
02:34 < syncan> resolve the As of the name
02:35 < noobee> im not sure which ip should i put
02:35 < noobee> i think this vpn is used to connect to cassandra
02:35 < noobee> and im having problem connecting to the cassandra
02:35 < syncan> are you hitting a domain name when it fails though?
02:35 < noobee> i dont think so
02:36 < noobee> because when i ping the cassandra domain
02:36 < noobee> it doesnt give me anything
02:36 < syncan> are you linux/mac or windows?
02:37 < noobee> oh right now its ok
02:37 < noobee> i think its a problem in the VPN server side
02:37 < noobee> sometimes i can ping to the vpn domain
02:37 < noobee> sometimes i cant
02:38 < syncan> your VPN gateway?
02:42 < noobee> im currently connected
02:42 < noobee> but when i reping the domain, it doesnt give me anything again
02:42 < noobee> so right now
02:42 < noobee> i just put the domain and ip in /etc/hosts
02:43 < noobee> hopefully when im reconnecting next time, there wouldnt be any problem
02:56 < kenperkins> hopefully simple question: why does this app not exit automatically?
02:56 < kenperkins> https://gist.github.com/kenperkins/5641008
02:58 < ningu> I assume because the connection is still open
02:58 < kenperkins> write, so completely expected
02:59 < kenperkins> correct even
03:01 < d4rklit3> to all the haters
03:02 < d4rklit3> i wrote my own browserify middleware that does exactly what i want
03:02 < d4rklit3> im out!
03:02 <@isaacbw> lol
03:02  * shama crickets chirping
03:03 < syncan> damn, we just got served. or was it client-side only?
03:04 < nathanbz> does anyone know why websockets has a Uprade connection header
03:04 < nathanbz> response header
03:04 < deoxxa> nathanbz: no, it's a mystery
03:04 < syncan> because websockets is an upgraded port 80
03:04 < syncan> "upgraded"
03:04 < nathanbz> it confuses my small brain :(
03:05 < nathanbz> also that websockets make my socket.io completely break 
03:05 <@isaacbw> the bastards
03:05 < syncan> it basically says "we aren't playing your old http header game anymore. we put new headers now."
03:05 < ChrisPartridge> its a travesty
03:05 < deoxxa> nathanbz: the upgrade header pretty much says "ok, http's job is over, after these headers there's going ot be a completely different protocol"
03:05 < deoxxa> syncan: ha
03:06 < syncan> i like the way your invisible protocol man said it
03:07 < nathanbz> okes
03:07 < nathanbz> https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io/wiki/Varnish-and-Socket.IO
03:07 < nathanbz> isn't that bad
03:07 < nathanbz> what if something else on my site uses websockets :P
03:07 <@isaacbw> then you're a turd
03:08 < ChrisPartridge> ouch
03:08 < syncan> let me polish that and call it MagicSocks
03:08 < nathanbz> turd samwicch
03:10 < nathanbz> it just sits at 101 switching protocals
03:10 < nathanbz> the barstard never switches
03:13 < ChrisPartridge> nathanbz: and you're using varnish?
03:16 < nathanbz> yes
03:16 < kenperkins> is there a way to detect that all code has executed and there's nothign on the stack?
03:16 < kenperkins> i.e. can I force close a TLS connection if a program has finished
03:16 < aggresive_cow> hi, im having trouble getting npm install jsdom to work on lubuntu. im not an experienced linux user so maybe there is some problem with file permissions. http://pastebin.com/YtX7AVtn 
03:17 < nathanbz> websocket seems to connect then instantly close the connection
03:18 < aggresive_cow> i've tried uninstalling and reinstalling jsdom, and using npm -f. so far nothing but fail
03:19 < kenperkins> wow major highway bridge collapsed here in WA state
03:19 < kenperkins> http://www.king5.com/news/local/Report-I-5-bridge-collapses-over-Skagit-River-cars-in-water-208758631.html?hpt=hp_t3
03:19 < syncan> wow really? i'm in seattle, heh
03:20 < syncan> holy shite
03:20 < kenperkins> lucky it was out in the sticks
03:20 < kenperkins> imagine the ship canal bridge or aurora bridge collapsing
03:21 < syncan> sometimes not hard to imagine. i thought they improved that bridge recently
03:21 < ChrisPartridge> nathanbz: can you remove varnish from the equation to test everything works fine otherwise
03:24 <@isaacbw> that's terrifying
03:24 <@isaacbw> PSA if you're in a car falling into the water, open the window
03:25 < syncan> if you're a car failing into the water, wonder why you're a sentient vehicle and then warn the driver
03:25 < syncan> (the more you know)
03:25 <@isaacbw> lol
03:26 <@isaacbw> seriously though, get a window open or you'll be trapped 
03:27 <@isaacbw> damn that's terrying
03:27 < syncan> i still think in my head .. of just rolling down the window. like literally rolling the old windows down
03:28 <@isaacbw> who needs power windows
03:28 <@isaacbw> it's amazing how many unknown engineers we trust our lives with
03:29 <@isaacbw> and even worse, non-engineers who make engineering decisions
03:29 < syncan> it's terrifyingly amazing
03:29 < syncan> yes
03:30 < syncan> "ship it!" 
03:31 < ChrisPartridge> "we need stronger steel!" "no, use more bolts!"
03:32 < syncan> "sir, we write navigation software …"
03:33 < kenperkins> isaacbw: i have kids man, it's terrifying
03:34 < kenperkins> not sure I could get them out if that happened
03:34 < ningu> isaacbw: I object just as strenuously to engineers who make non-engineering decisions :)
03:34 < kenperkins> (in toddler seats, with 5 point harnesse)
03:37 <@isaacbw> I wonder if the best thing to do in that situation would be to make sure all the windows are *closed* and just hope your car holds and someone can get to you in time
03:38 < kenperkins> well, if I could get in the back seat (with the windows up) I'd feel a lot better
03:38 < kenperkins> the questino is, how fast could I move once I realized what happend
03:38 <@isaacbw> probably not very fast in free fall
03:39 < ChrisPartridge> isaacbw: an uncle of mine dived in after an elderly couple that drove over the edge of warf (thought they were in reverse), he spent 30 minutes trying to smash the windows before the ES pulled him out the water
03:39 < ChrisPartridge> wharf*
03:39 < leichtgewicht> I find it fascinating: How do you pick engineering decisions and non-engineering decisions clearly apart? How do you know someone is an engineer? Is it okay for an hardware engineer to do software engineer decisions? So many questions(and words), so few time...
03:41 < nathanbz> like everything
03:41 < nathanbz> you just need correct test cases 
03:41 < nathanbz> to test against :)
03:42 <@isaacbw> "Test ruthlessly"
03:42 < deoxxa> assert(ruthlessly)
03:43 < leichtgewicht> Pah: titles ... just smoke and mirrors
03:44 < leichtgewicht> sorry: i think the english phrase would be "sound and smoke"?
03:44 <@isaacbw> no
03:44 <@isaacbw> smoke and mirrors is the english
03:45 < leichtgewicht> alright ;)
03:47 <@isaacbw> oh man, the aws site isn't broken for me anymore
03:47 <@isaacbw> woo
03:55 < nathanbz> man websockets just keeps failing when it's trying to change protocal :(
03:59 < ChrisPartridge> nathanbz: did you remove varnish from the equation, and test?
04:01 < nathanbz> well it works fine if i use xhr polling
04:01 < nathanbz> so im assuming its a setting in varnish
04:01 < nathanbz> but i'm doing everything that should be done :(
04:04 < nathanbz> Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at wss://localhost/socket.io/1/websocket/ACD1Qyl5bqpFHoiymZag.
04:04 < nathanbz> qq
04:06 < ChrisPartridge> nathanbz: yeah, well the issue is going to be varnish, so i guess get your varnish pro onto, if not, start reading :P
04:23 < progrock`> hmm, anyone here every use salsa for a 'grid framework'... or have a preferred one
04:23 < progrock`> looking for pretty minimal.. and either Stylus or SASS
04:26 < kenperkins> isaacbw: news coming in is an oversize truck impacted the girders, causing a structure failure
04:27 <@isaacbw> damn
04:28 < ChrisPartridge> progrock`: you could take just the grid feature from bootstrap/foundation
04:40 < noobee> is it safe to make a string with . as a key of associative array in JS?
04:40 < noobee> like 
04:40 < noobee> var something = { 'something.some' : 'aaa' };
04:40 < gluxon> noobee: I would definitely avoid that.
04:41 < noobee> ya it seems dangerous
04:41 < creationix> what dangerous?
04:41 < creationix> *what's
04:41 < gluxon> noobee: Not dangerous.
04:41 < gluxon> noobee: You can do it. It's just other people won't like it when reading your code.
04:42 < gluxon> noobee: You will have to access that property from the alternative syntax.
04:42 < creationix> no worse than dashes I guess
04:42 < gluxon> Ex something['something.some']
04:42 < noobee> its just to access something thats not that complex
04:42 < brycebaril> Yeah, avoid it for statically chosen keys so you don't end up making bugs, but likewise little need to worry about it for dynamic keys that will always be accessed via []
04:43 < gluxon> brycebaril: I wouldn't do it at all if possible. New coders to a project that does this won't like it at all. :(
04:43 < gluxon> It is fertile soil for a bug.
04:45 < brycebaril> gluxon: I'm saying don't choose them as names, but don't scrub input for it if the name won't actually be in your code.
05:15 < ningu> so today I wrote a node script to print blog posts out on a receipt printer.
05:15 < ningu> this feels not very useful somehow. ;)
05:17 -!- mode/#Node.js [+o TooTallNate] by ChanServ
05:18 < progrock`> I really need to stop being lazy and get basic user management working (I suppose code it from scratch)... cant be too hard with mongoose/mongodb
05:18 < progrock`> well, I htink monogdb is whta I want to go with... tho any no sql woudl work
05:19 < progrock`> anyone recommend something over mongo?
05:19 < fiws> i want some mongoose client side thing
05:21 < deoxxa> ningu: that's awesome, like that little news thing you could buy
05:21 < deoxxa> ningu: like http://bergcloud.com/littleprinter/ :>
05:22 < ningu> hehe
05:23 < ningu> I want something that small
05:23 < ningu> this thing was $50 and it's still kind of big, and it's low quality
05:23 < fiws> obj.__defineSetter__(*, f) can i somehow do this?
05:23 < ningu> but fun to play with
05:23 < deoxxa> fiws: nope
05:24 < ningu> I've been delving into the ESC/POS language
05:24 < ningu> which is very badly documented
05:24 < ningu> but is what most receipt printers apparently use
05:24 < deoxxa> interesting
05:24 < ningu> basically I want something I can take with me to the field
05:24 < ningu> thermal printers need more power than you can get over USB so I'll use a battery pack
05:25 < deoxxa> looks like the cheapest one i can get is about $200 :x
05:25 < ningu> yeah
05:25 < deoxxa> i want one now as well
05:25 < deoxxa> maybe i can get one second-hand
05:25 < ningu> this is mine: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008ER472I/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
05:25 < ningu> it works
05:25 < ningu> that's about all I can say for it :)
05:25 < deoxxa> i used to have one
05:26 < deoxxa> i threw it out like an idiot
05:26 < ningu> the older ones don't use USB but you could probably just use an adapter
05:26 < ningu> this one is basically just a plain serial connection
05:26 < ningu> I'm using node-usb
05:27 < ningu> but it incorrectly reports the length of its usb config descriptor as 2 bytes shorter than it is, and libusb barfs on that -- I patched it to assume the descriptor is 2 bytes longer
05:27 < ningu> that's kind of obnoxious
05:27 < deoxxa> weird
05:27 < ningu> yeah, well, it's some no name company in china
05:27 < ningu> they didn't get all their bits and bytes straight
05:28 < ningu> what I really want is something like, http://www.amazon.com/IVI-Scribe-612-Receipt-Printer/dp/B005ATYJH6
05:28 < ningu> but I doubt there is any remotely open spec for programming it :(
05:29 < deoxxa> aw man that looks cool
05:29 < ningu> there's one on ebay for $25
05:29 < ningu> well, a similar one
05:29 < ningu> deoxxa: any idea what kind of data cable this is? http://www.ebay.com/itm/IVI-Scribe-607-Thermal-Receipt-Printer-Adapter-TESTED-689R-/121113255235?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item1c32e99d43
05:30 < deoxxa> looks almost like ps/2
05:30 < ningu> yeah I know
05:30 < ningu> oh... you know
05:30 < ningu> if the small end goes on the printer, the big end looks like an old AT keyboard
05:31 < ningu> yep you can see the port in the last image
05:31 < ningu> so I wonder how you could go from that to a usb port :)
05:32 < ningu> too bad the manufacturer has no website
05:33 < deoxxa> lol
05:33 < deoxxa> ningu: how about a phone number? mailing address? :P
05:33 <@isaacbw> chinese companies are pretty awful at using the web
05:33 < ningu> http://www.merchantcircle.com/business/International.Verifact.Inc.972-445-4135
05:33 < ningu> they're in texas apparently
05:34 < ningu> I'll try calling and see what they say
05:35 < deoxxa> > Āi! printer xièxiè!
05:35 < syncan> that looks very much like a 7-pin MIDI cable
05:35 < syncan> i'm pretty sure it is
05:35 < deoxxa> and that's the extent of my chinese skills
05:35 < ningu> syncan: huh
05:36 < ningu> so if I wanted to drive it over a usb serial connection...
05:36 < ningu> I guess there are usb to midi adapters
05:37 < ningu> this one is also amusing and mysterious: http://www.ebay.com/itm/Way-Systems-WAY-S-Portable-Thermal-Receipt-Printer-w-Accessories-547K-/121113244698?pt=COMP_Printers&hash=item1c32e9741a
05:38 < ningu> ps/2 port as well
05:38 < syncan> ah wow
05:39 < ningu> way systems has a web site but that thing isn't listed :P

05:48 <@isaacbw> nevermind :,C
06:00 < Stumbler> Would anyone be so kind as to point me to a resource that would help me learn how to pass sockets around a set of server instances?

06:27 < progrock`> ok, i must admit, these grid mixins, and @extends is pretty cool.. finally can get back to semantic html while using a framework.. and even better, can drastically chang layout responsively
06:29 < JohnONolan> progrock`: welcome to the party
06:30 < progrock`> JohnONolan: haha, thanks.. yeah, havent really made many public websites in the last 8 or so years... minus 1 that got me my job 3 years ago
06:31 < JohnONolan> progrock`: if you get to the point of being interested in mixin libraries - checkout bourbon.io before compass (it's the same thing, but less shitty)
06:33 < progrock`> JohnONolan: haha, been using compass purely out of laziness... clearly its nothing special
06:34 < progrock`> JohnONolan: any major differences?
06:34 < JohnONolan> progrock`: In terms of usage - no - almost identical. In terms of output - yes, it's a much more lightweight library with much more up to date standards
06:35 < JohnONolan> eg. compass has mixins for border radius, box shadow, opacity
06:35 < nathan7> I need to port one of these things to Stylus
06:35 < JohnONolan> bourbon doesn't as all the major browsers have implemented that already
06:35 < nathan7> Mainly the grid bits
06:35 < JohnONolan> (non-prefixed)
06:35 < JohnONolan> so bourbon makes you write cleaner sass, and output cleaner css, while being less clumsy
06:36 < JohnONolan> (I only converted a few weeks ago, so I'm high on the bourbon koolaid)
06:36 < progrock`> haha, I'll give it a shot
06:36 < progrock`> I will say I liked the convenience of setting up salsa with compass
06:36 < progrock`> tho I guess theres liek 1 extra step to set it up with bourban 
06:40 <@isaacbw> progrock`: you need a new keyboard
06:41 < progrock`> isaacbw: I'm using a thinkpad... when I work 10+ hours a day on a $300 keyboard...
06:41 < JohnONolan> show me this $300 keyboard
06:41 <@isaacbw> progrock`: hah okay, I feel your pain
06:41 < JohnONolan> if it's $300 it had damn well better make me coffee while I type on it
06:42 < GreenDog> i would like a $300 keyboard
06:42 < GreenDog> maybe
06:42 <@isaacbw> I'm not sure what you get above $100 though
06:42 < ChrisPartridge> JohnONolan: most of the expensive ones these days just make an extra loud click
06:42 < JohnONolan> GreenDog: if you pay me $300 I will type everything you say
06:42 < GreenDog> forever?
06:42 < JohnONolan> for a day
06:42 < Lorentz> http://www.elitekeyboards.com/products.php?sub=pfu_keyboards,hhkbpro2&pid=pdkb400wns
06:42 < GreenDog> no
06:42 < JohnONolan> fine forever
06:42 < JohnONolan> you drive a hard bargain
06:42 <@isaacbw> when will we get laptops with cherry keys
06:43 < progrock`> isaacbw: realforce, fully mechanical, 3 different pressures based on fingers
06:43 < progrock`> worth every penny
06:43 < Lorentz> isaacbw: never, because those switches aren't exactly flat
06:43 < progrock`> tho my work paid for it :)
06:43 < leichtgewicht> my coworkers complained about that wonderful Filco gold ...
06:43 <@isaacbw> progrock`: oh man, I might have to put that on my wishlist
06:43 < Lorentz> that said, realforce on pccg (local retailer) is going for $200
06:43 < progrock`> literally 15 people at my office (including all of management) bought my keyboard after using mine for 3 minutes
06:43 < Lorentz> so I dunno about your $300
06:44 < Lorentz> and on that note
06:44 < leichtgewicht> had to change to a silent thing : now apple keyboard ... silent and I am happy.
06:44 < Lorentz> I don't even like realforces
06:44 < JohnONolan> Lorentz: I don't know if you know this…. but that $400 keyboard has no letters on it. Like… for $400 I would at least expect them to put letters on it.
06:44 < Lorentz> give me a model m any day
06:44 < progrock`> isaacbw: I have a bad wrist.. and it legitimately helps a lot having th keyboard... absolutely worth it if you are on a ocmputer 8+ hours a day
06:44 < Lorentz> JohnONolan: http://www.elitekeyboards.com/products.php?sub=pfu_keyboards,hhkbpro2&pid=pdkb400ws
06:44 < Lorentz> there you go, now it does
06:44 < nathan7> JohnONolan: What do you need 'em for?
06:44 < ChrisPartridge> gee, 1 year warranty on that $400 keyboard as well
06:44 < JohnONolan> nathan7: t'was sarcasm ;)
06:44 < JohnONolan> Lorentz: SOLD
06:45 < nathan7> half worn away letters on keyboards drive me mad
06:45 < progrock`> this is mine: http://www.elitekeyboards.com/products.php?sub=topre_keyboards,rf104&pid=xf01t0    and thats where i bought it from as well
06:45 < nathan7> My thinkpad has held up for the past two years - all the keys are shiny from wear though (they were matte)
06:45 < leichtgewicht> Ninja keyboard : http://www.diatec.co.jp/en/det.php?prod_c=887
06:45 < progrock`> I also love how it comes with key locks.. my insert and capslock cannot be pressed
06:46 < nathan7> I don't get why anyone uses capslock as.. caps lock
06:46 < Lorentz> I currently use a leopold with cherry brown at work, and wife has a pink filco with cherry blue
06:46 < GreenDog> i need to test out those keyboards before buying
06:46 < nathan7> I have it as compose key
06:46 < Lorentz> GreenDog: there's a keyboard shop in japan you could visit
06:46 < progrock`> nathan7: I dont need any extra key there, so mine is just locked
06:46 < GreenDog> great!
06:46 < nathan7> progrock`: <compose>oa = å, <compose>tm = ™
06:47 < nathan7> progrock`: and a zillion other things
06:47 < Lorentz> mutated pinkies here, I have my pinky right in the ctrl where it belongs, not where caps locks normally sits
06:47 < progrock`> nathan7: ehh, no need for me
06:47 < progrock`> Lorentz: emacs user?
06:47 < Lorentz> progrock`: vim actually
06:48 < progrock`> Lorentz: oh, lol... me too... tho I dont use control so much... def not like an emacs suer
06:49 < progrock`> Lorentz: do you use TabBar?
06:49 < Lorentz> no?
06:50 < progrock`> Lorentz: do you use anything to show your open buffers/files?
06:50 < Lorentz> nope
06:50 < Lorentz> just open for terms
06:50 < progrock`> oh, ok
06:50 < progrock`> I like TabBar, but its been giving me lots of trouble lately.. opens multiple times in random splits, etc
06:50 < Lorentz> it's a habit from e16 days, when you could literally have tens of hundreds of virtual desktop spaces
06:51 < Lorentz> sort of have everything organised by a visible grid system
06:52 < progrock`> oh, gotcha, yeah i have coworkers using xmonad or the likes.. I cant get used to that, I stick to gnome-shell
06:52 < Lorentz> each desktop would have just one terminal, or two/three maybe depending on what I'm doing
06:54 < progrock`> so, I'm working on a collabortive jsfiddle... mroe or less for fun (and to get myself used to socket.io among some other things)
06:55 < progrock`> anyway, I have a "settings" thing equivalent to the left panel on jsfiddle (tho likely will make it a modal)....
06:56 < progrock`> with regards to semantic html, what do you think the container should be.. would an 'aside' make sense
07:00 < progrock`> weird, found this html5doctor pdf hats a decision tree for html5 semantics...doeas 'article' really make sense for a wapper around a sidebar/modal?
07:00 < nathanbz> does anyone have a sample for pound + varnish + socket.io with websockets ?
07:00 < progrock`> then 'section' for each part of this sidebar/modal?
07:01 < progrock`> nathanbz: whats pound + varnish?... about to make my first socket.io/websockets app, lol
07:03 < progrock`> ok varnish is a cache
07:04 < progrock`> nathanbz: is the idea that varnish will serve the most current state of whatever you are using socket.io with, without hitting a file or database?
07:05 < nathanbz> progrock it's just a load balancer
07:05 < nathanbz> cause the info goes over https
07:06 < nathanbz> so pound -> varnish "piped" -> nodejs
07:06 < nathanbz> but it looks like websockets can't be done with pound like this
07:07 < progrock`> nathanbz: wait, pound is the load balancer?
07:09 < progrock`> unless I'm lookinm gat the wrong varnish, tho this def looks like a cache
07:12 < nathanbz> yeah varnish is cache
07:12 < nathanbz> but we use it to just forward the request to node
07:12 < nathanbz> so no caching
07:12 < FoxDiller> I broke this: http://i.imgur.com/xAB90Ea.jpg when I started using Varnish.
07:12 < Sven_vB> what's the benefit of just forwarding it?
07:13 < nathanbz> there isn't one
07:13 < progrock`> nathanbz: im confused at that one, lol.. I use nginx for proxy to node
07:13 < nathanbz> it also checks if the node server is up
07:13 < progrock`> oh
07:14 < nathanbz> nginx support web sockets these days ?
07:14 < fiws> yep
07:14 < nathanbz> might have to make the change
07:27 < sikor_sxe> hello, i am currently writing tests with mocha & zombie.js and i have problems figuring out how to define the reusable functions mentioned in the zombie docs: ".then( fillInName.bind(browser) )"
07:29 < sikor_sxe> how to define "fillInName"? basically right now i have the code working when doing ".then(browser.fire('#add-button', 'click'))"
07:29 < rynkan> IDE for hacking jade/(node)js?
07:30 < sikor_sxe> i'd like to create a function for that browser.fire part, so i can reuse that, though
07:31 < [AD]Turbo> hi there
07:32 < rynkan> awesome just got all parts/joins forwared to a junk-window in irssi
07:35 < foofoobar> I'm using express with EJS. How can I tell express to look for templates which have the extension '.html.ejs' instead of '.ejs' ?
07:35 < foofoobar> Because then my editor will recognize the syntax
07:38 < rynkan> What IDE do you guys/gals use for hacking jade/(node)js?
07:39 < px> textmate
07:40 < rynkan> px: cool, i'll check it out
07:41  * nathan7 scoffs at 'IDE'
07:41 < rynkan> nathan7: don't scoff, enlighten me
07:42 < arnorhs> rynkan: no IDE, we just use text editors
07:42 < nathan7> rynkan: an IDE is something that makes sense if you're writing, say, Java
07:42 < nathan7> rynkan: or C++
07:43 < nathan7> rynkan: You have a lot of boilerplate, it's hard to find your way through code without tooling
07:43 < nathan7> rynkan: I use a rather tweaked out vim - a fancy text editor
07:44 < rynkan> nathan7 & arnorhs : I hear you, I'ma javahead so thats why I asked for an IDE. can you get syntaxhighlightning/codecompletion with and editor?
07:44 < nathan7> rynkan: Yeah
07:44 < rynkan> nathan7: I use vim, but not to that extent, guess i should try it out more
07:45 < nathan7> rynkan: a tip: you want to be spending your time moving around in normal mode, not in insert mode
07:45 < arnorhs> I use vim for all my JS stuff
07:45 < arnorhs> though i also succumb to an IDE for java :/
07:45 < nathan7> rynkan: vim becomes muscle-memory after a while if you do that
07:45 < nathan7> Yeah, Java without an IDE is pure insanity
07:46 < rynkan> nathan7: cool, I'll have to try using wim out to its full potential then, thanks!
07:47 < nathan7> rynkan: if you enable hidden buffers that's also a big win
07:47 < nathan7> rynkan: lets you easily have many files open, I switch between them with buffergator
07:47 < nathan7> rynkan: http://github.com/nathan7/vimsauce that's my vim config
07:48 < rynkan> I'll have to google me a nice put vim on steroids tutorial :)
07:48 < arnorhs> i use ctrl+p
07:48 < nathan7> rynkan: You can use my config as inspiration maybe - I don't recommend outright taking someone else's config
07:49 < arnorhs> and sometimes just :b filename to jump between buffers
07:49 < arnorhs> i never use splits, though i can see that it could be handy sometimes
07:49 < nathan7> splits are lovely
07:49 < nathan7> I can have a spec on one side
07:50 < rynkan> i think splits are awesome
07:51 < arnorhs> i have the same issue with splits as i do with any app that's not fully full screen on my desktop (eg. i suck at multi-monitor setups)
07:51 < arnorhs> i just assume one thing has focus when the other thing does
07:51 < arnorhs> so i end up doing :w on the wrong file and not understanding that it didn't get updated etc
07:51 < arnorhs> my brain is just not wired for more than one visible things being able to have focus
07:53 < nathan7> arnorhs: I have a set of shortcuts for moving around windows, it helps
07:53 < rynkan> right now I'm usint three monitors with a terminal running tmux with 3-windows/screens on each monitor. netbenas and vistual studio is hidden in a vertical virtualdesktop setup. 
07:54 < nathan7> my WM tiles, my terminal tiles, my terminal multiplexer tiles, my editor tiles
07:54 < rynkan> I feel handicaped if suddenly need to useonly my laptop
07:54 < Lorentz> that's why I only ever use my laptop
07:54 < arnorhs> rynkan: that just sounds like an exercise in (hard to spot) frustration
07:54 < arnorhs> i have doubts in anybody's ability to truly multitask
07:55 < rynkan> each monitor has its specific use, i wouldn't say that i really multitask
07:55 < arnorhs> Lorentz: same
07:56 < arnorhs> rynkan: but i am impressed with your setup though
07:56 < rynkan> when i swich to netbeans my other two monitors are dimed out
07:58 < booyaa|foo> damn i misssed up editor speak
07:58 < rynkan> well it came to be aout of frustration having to work with multiple projects and this was the only way i could isolate things... not something i recomend
07:58  * booyaa|foo made the switch from screen to tmux a couple of days ago
07:59 < rynkan> booyaa|foo: me to, its awesome
07:59 < booyaa|foo> i'm sporting some harcore tuxinator action too
07:59 < standoo> helo
07:59 < rynkan> screen not supporting vertical splits was.. strange
08:00 < rynkan> at least the version i was using
08:00 < booyaa|foo> finally got the windows i wanted though left main pane vim code, top right pane vim tests, bottom right pane grunt watch
08:00 < booyaa|foo> rynkan: always found splits and c&p fiddly in screen
08:02 < booyaa|foo> need a bigger screen though... want to do this http://nils-blum-oeste.net/getting-started-with-tmux/#.UZ8eeaImPSg
08:06 < arnorhs> booyaa|foo: looks solid.. rMBP to the rescue ;)
08:06 < Qalqi> has anyone used dependency injection in node
08:06 < Qalqi> ?
08:06 < Qalqi> i am  looking at phil mander's inverted.js right now
08:07 < arnorhs> Qalqi: i have not
08:08 < rynkan> booyaa|foo: holycrap his a ninja
08:08 < booyaa|foo> arnorhs: true dat
08:08 < booyaa|foo> rynkan: when i saw that tmux layout that was the tipping point
08:09 < booyaa|foo> i already use a helluva lot of useful vim plugnis but that was the icing on the cake
08:09 < rynkan> booyaa|foo: saveing that for l8r
08:10 < booyaa|foo> rynkan: eggsellent
08:11 < rynkan> need to work on my gitfu for now, this year has come with a lot of changes svn -> git, java -> javascript, c -> c#, backend -> gamedev
08:12 < booyaa|foo> hahah excellent
08:12 < rynkan> salary hasn't changed tho -.-
08:13 < rynkan> booyaa|foo: whats tmuxinator?
08:17 < beg> I am done with my school for this semester. Does anyone need a developer?
08:18 < beg> I'd liek to get into the opensource scene, but I have no idea how to get started :)
08:18 < px> what's your email
08:21 < beg> px, wrote a mail to you
08:21 < beg> i mean message
08:23 < booyaa|foo> rynkan: it preloads your tmux session with panes. but the config for your panes is in yml
08:24 < booyaa|foo> it replaces tmux
08:25 < booyaa|foo> i'm sure it does loads of other stuff, but having a easy to read tmux config is nice
08:27 < Qalqi> arnorhs: isnt dependency injection a good thing to do?
08:29 < arnorhs> Qalqi: well, it's better than using globals, if that's what you mean
08:30 < Qalqi> quite confused which one to use. none of them have enough documentation. https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/modules#wiki-dependency-injection
08:32 < arnorhs> do you need a framework for your dependency injections? what are you trying to do?
08:36 < Qalqi> arnorhs: yes, I want some module to manage dependency injections
08:38 < rynkan> booyaa|foo: thanks!
08:40 < leichtgewicht> I understand that in a world with interfaces you want 
08:40 < leichtgewicht> some dependency injection
08:40 < leichtgewicht> but in node ... hmm ...
08:41 < Qalqi> leichtgewicht: what makes node different ?
08:42 < leichtgewicht> substack ... or rather the unix philosophy: If you want to do something complex you are doing something wrong (I am a terrible transcriber)
08:42 < leichtgewicht> functional programming seems just a little closer than inheritance based programming ...
08:44 < leichtgewicht> I think this is why arnorhs asked if you needed it ...
08:45 < nathanbz> is it a bad idea to increase xhr polling time to larger then 20 seconds
08:45 < buddyrandom> has anybody run into http://pastebin.com/s3Fgr8JU on ubuntu 12.04 with chris lea's ppa?

08:47 < ChrisPartridge> buddyrandom: whats the issue? I don't see any errors there?
08:49 < buddyrandom> well the issue i'm having will occur in the next step, if i don't have to worry about the warnings breaking stuff i'll try it again
08:50 < buddyrandom> chris: thanks for the reply i wasn't sure how much i should worry about those
08:50 < ChrisPartridge> buddyrandom: those warnings are just saying a couple of packages dont have source control repositories defined, which is no biggie
08:53 < buddyrandom> chris: good to know .. here's the recurring problem i keep having i was worried those errors could be affecting. this is the end result of 'npm -g install bitcoinjs' .. i guess the version of node-gyp in the repo's just isn't high enough for the current version of bitcoinjs and i'll probably have to build manually? http://pastebin.com/n133VD3M
08:54 < buddyrandom> they do say to build node manually, but as the version required on the site was lower than the one in chris's ppa i was hoping i could get away with it ;)
08:58 < Qalqi> leichtgewicht: arnorhs: but then I want to use isometric code that can be shifted back and forth on browser/server and we use angular on browser which has dep injection. 
08:58 < rynkan> anyone put linux on thier hp worklaptop and lived to tell the tale?
08:59 < Qalqi> using angular on server didnt seem a good idea but then how do we replicate the depencency innjection logic of angular onto node arnorhs,leichtgewicht
08:59 < buddyrandom> easier to put ubuntu on something than windows these days imho
08:59 < Qalqi> buddyrandom: its always been the case
08:59 < buddyrandom> qalqi true true
08:59 < Qalqi> windows take hell lot of time to install 
09:00 < buddyrandom> driver support for older hardware is better too it seems
09:00 < rynkan> looked at trying arch but the install-notes seems milelong
09:01 < buddyrandom> try manjaro then
09:01 < buddyrandom> arch with ubuntu's installer
09:01 < Qalqi> its always fun installing various versions of linux on my system'
09:02 < rynkan> manjaro, cool checking it out
09:02 < rynkan> I'm afraid of battery-time, multiple screen support and.. drivers...
09:02 < rynkan> http://www.linlap.com/hp_elitebook_8560w not looking promising
09:03 < buddyrandom> ryankan: scroll down to the notes and summary :)
09:04 < rynkan> I've read that :)
09:05 < rynkan> is it "I've read that"?
09:05 < buddyrandom> yep 
09:05 < rynkan> cool
09:05 < rynkan> translates bad to swedish
09:05 < buddyrandom> if you can replace "I have" in the sentence you can use "I've" 
09:06 < rynkan> buddyrandom: thanks :)
09:06 < buddyrandom> good way to remember the difference between 'Your' and 'You're' .. if you can use 'You are' you use "You're"
09:07 < buddyrandom> heh np
09:08 < rynkan> #Node.js is quite flexible, from nodejs-questions to language-lessons 
09:09 < px> also we can process many different things at a time
09:09 < buddyrandom> no deout
09:09 < px> and you can use some of our advice in the browser
09:21 < donCams> hi guys
09:32 -!- mode/#Node.js [+o piscisaureus_] by ChanServ
09:37 < hakuna> js noob here.  Can you please tell me why this code is not working: http://jsfiddle.net/wTVHN/    Reference: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list#try-it   . Thanks :)
09:42 < fiws> because u never call search()?
09:45 < ashnur> morningú
09:46 < ashnur> s/ú//
09:48 < ashnur> any advice on where should I begin to implement authentication? I know what i would like and I know there are thousands of solutions, but so far I couldn't choose one which is simple and db agnostic
09:49 < px> you could roll your own
09:50 < ashnur> i don't know how to begin 
09:51 < ashnur> and feels like if there are so many, there should be some good between them
09:51 < fiws> passport?
09:52 < ashnur> i tried passport
09:53 < ashnur> it is certainly the most popular, which is a good thing
09:53 < donCams> hey ashnur 
09:53 < ashnur> hi. 
09:53 < donCams> ashnur, passport seems to be the preferred authentication middleware
09:59 < ssafejava> ashnur: passport is good, I found everyauth to be very simple, depends on your db. if you're using mongo + mongoose, mongoose-auth is probably your fastest way to auth
10:00 < nathanbz> wouldnt increasing the poll length of xhr polling reduce cpu usage
10:01 < nathanbz> as there would be less connections
10:01 < ashnur> i am trying to avoid using mongoose
10:01 < ashnur> this everyauth name sounds familiar too, but I will check it again. if not, i will go with passport for now
10:01 < ashnur> can't waste too much time on nitpicking
10:09 < ssafejava> nathanbz: yeah to a certain degree, i wouldn't worry unless you have a *lot* of xhr polling going on or a very short interval
10:19 < r1card> Is there an instrument for deep copy in Node.js
10:20 < r1card> Deep copy a hiearchy of JSON-like datas
10:20 < r1card> data*
10:20 < ssafejava> r1card: https://github.com/pvorb/node-clone
10:20 < px> JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))
10:21 < r1card> px, creative solution ;)
10:21 < r1card> ssafejava, thanks. Everything is a module isn't it :/
10:21 < ssafejava> stdlib only contains what it needs to contain
10:21 < ssafejava> :)
10:22 < fiws> r1card, do you like underscore?
10:23 < r1card> fiws, I neither like nor dislike it. It has some useful things.
10:24 < fiws> ok.. because if u use it, switch to lodash. that one also has deep cloning
10:25 < r1card> Heh
10:25 < r1card> Why lodash?
10:26 < ssafejava> r1card: lodash added deep cloning while the underscore devs insist they don't want/need it
10:26 < fiws> its just underscore 2.0. faster, compatible with underscore and more functionality
10:27 < r1card> ssafejava, fiws, I see thanks
10:28 < ssafejava> fiws?
10:28 < fiws> ya?
10:28 < r1card> Hehe, 
10:28 < ssafejava> oh lol. hahaha I thought that was an acronym for something. nvm
10:28 < r1card> :P
10:37 < zenetik> hi, does somebody know a vnc client 100% js ? (including the tcp proxy) 
10:38 < zenetik> this one failed for me https://github.com/bgaff/vnc.js
10:40 < Qalqi> http://stackoverflow.com/a/1638961/1153325
10:42 < Qalqi> i hate javascript
10:42 < zenetik> why ?
10:43 < Qalqi> its looks so diferent from all popular languages
10:44 < fiws>  i hate it because its different... meh
10:46 < zenetik> few years ago, i hated js. Now i hate all the rest except python and erlang
10:46 < fiws> zenetik, what have you tried so far?
10:46 < sambarino> looks so different from popular languages? do you mean python / ruby?
10:47 < sambarino> or vb?
10:47 < sikor_sxe> Qalqi: coffeescript seems nice
10:47 < zenetik> fiws: C, php, java
10:48 < sambarino> zenetik: those look similar to js, that's why i was curious
10:48 < zenetik> php event based ?
10:48 < sambarino> "look" as in... syntax
10:49 < zenetik> yeah perhaps for big lines why not
10:50 < zenetik> but well, nodejs birth kick js in front of all hehe
10:51 < zenetik> trying to contact the guy behind https://github.com/bgaff/vnc.js
10:51 < zenetik> this is the only one solution to have a full js vnc client
10:51 < zenetik> all others are using python tcp proxies or similar
11:01 < Qalqi> nodejs is confusing
11:01 < Qalqi> i dont understand any DI modules in nodejs
11:02 < Qalqi> what are they trying to do?
11:02 < fiws> DI?
11:03 < Qalqi> Dependency Injection
11:03 < thr4sh> Describe what you think is a DI Module in node.
11:04 < thr4sh> there's require (which is similar to ruby's require, or python's import)
11:04 < guest3321> dsfasdf
11:04 < Qalqi> https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/modules#wiki-dependency-injection
11:05 < thr4sh> ah... probably inteneded to aid in plugin development, or plugin system development
11:09 <@isaacbw> Qalqi: do you not understand the concept of dependency injection? There's a lot of material on it on the web
11:13 <@isaacbw> it's generally useful for testing and configuration
11:13 <@isaacbw> but mostly testing
11:17 < Qalqi> ok
11:19 < leichtgewicht> isaacbw, I never used it for testing but mostly for configuration. However: I understand that some want their logic abstract something which node modules arn't good at right now.
11:20 < leichtgewicht> node-db for example doesn't separate read access from write access.
11:21 < leichtgewicht> or config from use
11:21 < sikor_sxe> i have a question regarding testing with mocha. before testing i need to put something in mongodb. there is the before() func in mocha, however the MongoClient functions are all asynchronous. i guess i have to use promised, but i am a bit lost here *how* to use that for example in a MongoClient.connect() call :/ anyone got a hint?
11:21 < Qalqi> how do I change the behaviour of node_module without changing its source code? Dependency Injection does that?
11:21 < leichtgewicht> Qalqi: The point is: you should never want to do that.
11:21 < leichtgewicht> Because the modules are supposed to be simple.
11:22 < leichtgewicht> If a module doesn't do what you want it to do: fork it, write your own impl.
11:22 < Qalqi> what to do if the npm node module is not adequate for a particular purpose.
11:24 < leichtgewicht> take another one...
11:24 < leichtgewicht> if its somewhere git hosted: fork it.
11:25 < leichtgewicht> Anyway: that is the process I have been seeing.
11:25 < leichtgewicht> Thats why most packages are small.
11:25 < leichtgewicht> and often similar.
11:27 <@isaacbw> three cheers for package dilution
11:29 < zenetik> sikor_sxe: did you take a look at mongoose ?
11:29  * zenetik recommand mongoose
11:29 < sikor_sxe> yeah, but orm was a bit over the top for me.
11:31 < Qalqi> how do we make these blue color comments?
11:33 < nyuszika7h> Qalqi: /me
11:34  * Qalqi qalqi thanks
11:35  * Qalqi thanks nyuszika7h
11:35 < nyuszika7h> np
11:37 < zenetik> substack: ping
11:37  * Qalqi wants to ask if nyuszika7h was a japanese manga character
11:38 < nyuszika7h> nope
11:38 < nyuszika7h> it's just some random nick
11:58 < rhalff> hi, anybody knows an example on how to process images uploaded with  a PUT request and application/x-www-from-urlencoded ?
11:59 < rhalff> I have a naive function which concatenates the Buffers into a body value, but I'm not sure what is happening there.
11:59 < rhalff> the chunks when I log them are buffers, but the concatenated body seems to be binary or something.
12:01 < rhalff> here is my very genious code...: https://gist.github.com/rhalff/5643010
12:01 < zenetik> no robust WebSocket to TCP proxy/bridge for node ?
12:02 < rhalff> uhm, oops, that is not the correct code
12:02 < duhduh> hey guys
12:03 < duhduh> any idea how forever.js keeps running in the background?
12:04 < fiws> child_process i guess
12:14 < delr> hello guys, a small question: how to install the node include headers, the *h files? 
12:14 < delr>  I tried "configure --debug & make & make install", but the headers are not installed.
12:15 < delr> the version is v0.10.7 release
12:17 < mscdex> rhalff: files don't get uploaded with application/x-www-form-urlencoded
12:17 < flairvelocity> Am in a big problem anyone help me plz
12:17 < mscdex> delr: so you don't have /usr/local/include/node ?
12:17 < flairvelocity> how i can use nested query using client.query()
12:17 < flairvelocity> ??
12:18 < delr> hi mscdex, no, I don't have /usr/loca/include/node. The binary is installed though.
12:18 < flairvelocity> anyone help me
12:18 < flairvelocity> hel me
12:18 < flairvelocity> help me
12:18 < flairvelocity> help me
12:19 < rhalff> mscdex, they do! :-)
12:19 < mscdex> delr: so if you do `./configure && make && make install` it doesn't install headers that way either?
12:19 < zenetik> flairvelocity: we can help if we understand what you are saying
12:19 < mscdex> rhalff: how? as a base64 value
12:19 < mscdex> ?
12:19 < radiodario> Hi, i'm reading the npm docs and it says that it is recommended to run npm as root, but elsewhere in the web they say never to do that. Is it better to change the permissions of /usr/local?
12:19  * rhalff uhmz, let met check.
12:20 < flairvelocity> am using node js and mysql
12:20 < flairvelocity> i need to write a nested query
12:20 < delr> mscdex: yes, I have done that. it didn't install the headers.
12:20 < zenetik> flairvelocity: which node module are you using ?
12:20 < fiws> radiodario, if you install a module globally you have to run npm as root
12:21 < delr> wait.. I haven't try ./configure withouth --debug..
12:21 < delr> let me try...
12:21 < flairvelocity> for example client.query('query1',function(){ client.query('query2',function(){ return result })                })
12:21 < flairvelocity> am using mysql
12:21 < mscdex> radiodario: you can use npm as non-root, but if you installed node to a place that requires root to write to and want to install a module globally, you'll have to use root
12:21 < flairvelocity> node-mysql
12:21 < radiodario> cool thanks
12:22 < bnoordhuis> delr, mscdex: `make install` doesn't install headers
12:22 < bnoordhuis> use node-gyp if you want to build an addon
12:23 < delr> bnoordhuis, thanks, I will give it a try.
12:23 < flairvelocity> hello <zenetik>
12:23 < gildean> flairvelocity: so what's the problem with that line?
12:23 < flairvelocity> am not able to return the result with callback
12:24 < gildean> flairvelocity: you should be able to nest the queriess within the callbacks of other queries
12:24 < mscdex> flairvelocity: you can't return a value in an async callback like that
12:24 < flairvelocity> so how i can solve that
12:24 < flairvelocity> ?
12:24 < mscdex> flairvelocity: pass in a callback to that block and instead of `return result` do something like `callback(null, result);`
12:25 < flairvelocity> ok
12:25 < flairvelocity> an how i get the call back value ?
12:25 < flairvelocity> mean the second query vale
12:25 < flairvelocity> *value
12:26 < mscdex> flairvelocity: that's what you're passing to the callback...
12:26 < fiws> also it should look like client.query('query1',function(err, result). don't know if you just removed that to keep the chat dry
12:26 < flairvelocity> sorry fiws
12:27 < flairvelocity> mscdex plz show me an example plz
12:27 < zenetik> flairvelocity: did you check the doc of your module ?
12:27 < zenetik> https://github.com/felixge/node-mysql ?
12:28 < flairvelocity> yes
12:28 < gildean> function getSomeData(query1, query2, callback) { client.query(query1, function (err, rows, fields) { if (!err) { result[query1] = { rows: rows, fields: fields; client.query(query2, function (err, rows, fields) { if (!err) { result[query2] = { rows: rows, fields: fields }; callback(result); } }); });
12:28 < gildean> or something like that
12:28 < gildean> missing } at the end
12:28 < fiws> aaah gist
12:28 < gildean> fiws: nah, wasn't long enough, it fits nicely to a single irc-message
12:29 < fiws> sadly i don't have syntax highlighting and code prettifying in my irc client
12:30 < flairvelocity> Thank you very much gildean
12:30 < flairvelocity> am trying it now
12:31 < gildean> flairvelocity: it's missing 'var result = {}; from the beginning
12:31 < gildean> add that there
12:32 < fiws> btw flairvelocity you might wanna look into async.js 
12:45 < adamsmeat> in http, how do i respond with a file, like what php does, defaulting to index.php when accessing the root?
12:46 < adamsmeat> because right now, it just shows the content of the root folder and is not defaulting to index.html
12:46 < shesek> what are you using to serve the files?
12:47 < adamsmeat> expressjs
12:47 < adamsmeat> I want to send plain index.html file
12:47 < adamsmeat> res.render('index.html'); aint doing it
12:48 < shesek> are you serving a directory with multiple files, or just want to send a specific file?
12:49 < adamsmeat> pretty much the root folder is supposed to be static
12:49 < shesek> are you using connect's static middleware?
12:50 < adamsmeat> sorry, if my questions are noobish, just diving head on to nodejs, nope using api provided by ExpressJS, but I understand res, req are just what's in the base http api
12:51 < adamsmeat> How do I do the apache counterpart of using front-controller?
12:51 < shesek> express extends the base request/response objects with some extra methods/properties
12:51 < adamsmeat> I'm using AngularJS so mine is one-paged
12:52 < adamsmeat> yup, but can't find, how do I send the default controller 'index.html', right now, it just goes to the root folder
12:52 < shesek> if you're using connect's static middleware (which is what express exposes as express.static()), it should serve index.html by default
12:52 < adamsmeat> I see. thanks buddy
12:53 < adamsmeat> so static() is just equivalent to responding with that file, eh
12:53 < gildean> adamsmeat: either use the static middleware (app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public')); or use res.sendFile()
12:53 < shesek> https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/blob/master/lib/middleware/static.js#L37
12:53 < adamsmeat> thanks
12:53 < shesek> may I ask why you're using node if all you're doing is serving static files?
12:53 < gildean> adamsmeat: static is for serving static assets, it uses streams to deliver the files
12:54 < shesek> a traditional web server like nginx would probably do a better job at it
12:54 < adamsmeat> shesek: I am using nodejs in my dev workflow for angularjs, and I need right now to expose my static files
12:55 < gildean> shesek: i'm presuming his angular app uses the express app as a json api or something
12:56 < adamsmeat> not really, not there yet, but will proceed with it soon. for now, im using it to create auto listener on port I need for karma tests while dev'ing...
13:01 < aandy> hey, i'm trying to do some doc'ing for some functions in a module of mine. it's not a requirenment (inline docs that is), but i'd like to do so for my own benefit. i'm currently trying to write jsdoc (which i've always used my own version of). so.. trying to be more compliant, i'm wondering, how to write when a parameter is an object, listing it's properties
13:01 < aandy> e.g. http://pastie.org/private/xvoa3ur7qirc6ggjmgbg#5-9 any suggestions how i'd write the highlighted "nicely"?
13:07 < aandy> @param options.<prop>, seems to be the concensus
13:08 < adamsmeat> How do i pass arguments to my js file? I start my http server(express) using this command 'node server.js', and it defaults to development env. Is there something like node server.js --env=production, and how will my server.js file pickup on this?
13:09 < SomeoneWeird> NODE_ENV=production node server
13:09 < SomeoneWeird> and then use process.env.NODE_ENV in your code
13:09 < SomeoneWeird> express etc automatically switches to production when it sees that flag
13:10 < adamsmeat> I see. 'NODE_ENV=production node server' this on console?
13:10 < SomeoneWeird> yes
13:11 < adamsmeat> thanks. I wonder under what category in the docs the things for the cli
13:25 < werle> anyone here using lazy.js with node?
13:31 < Sven_vB> werle, where can i learn more about lazy.js?
13:32 < werle> Sven_vB: https://github.com/dtao/lazy.js
13:35 < Sven_vB> thanks
13:39 < werle> any zeromq'rs in here?
13:50 < Sven_vB> i need more of such stuff. whar is that category of libraries called?
13:51 < werle> Sven_vB: lazy or zeromq?
13:55 < Sven_vB> lazy
13:57 < booyaa|foo> oi knock off the name calling
13:57 < booyaa|foo> ;)
13:57 < werle> haha
13:58 < werle> Sven_vB: just some utility library I guess
13:58 <@isaacbw> need moar dependencies
14:05 < Sven_vB> we need a better name. how about language level lifting?
14:09 < starta> can someone tell me why I could n't see output in this code ? dpaste.com/1197759/
14:16 < kayo> starta: 
14:16 < kayo> <script type="text/javascript" src="../d3/d3.v3.js"></script>
14:16 < kayo> it's wrong
14:17 < kayo> <script type="text/javascript" src"../d3/d3.v3.js" /> 
14:17 < kayo> will work
14:17 < fiws> more 3!
14:17 < fiws> do i have to escape - in regex?
14:18 < adamsmeat> should I allow my script to alter the environment? or is it bad practice?
14:20 < kurteknikk> Can anybody help with closing a server in node.js with connections keep-alive ?
14:23 <@isaacbw> fiws: no
14:24 <@isaacbw> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Javascript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp
14:24 < fiws> but A-B
14:24 < fiws> ok..
14:24 <@isaacbw> well, if it's in a character set yes
14:24 < Sven_vB> fivs, in a range you'd have to escape it.
14:24 < fiws> w
14:26 < fiws> but thanks isaacbw and Sven_vB 
14:27 < starta> kayo: I change it but It doesn't  fix!! I could n't see body script output!! 
14:29 < kayo> starta: but you can see your paragraph?
14:29 < starta> kayo: I just see that phrase 
14:30 <@isaacbw> please try to keep clientside stuff in ##javascript
14:30 < starta> kayo: my problem is in body script tag
14:31 <@isaacbw> starta: that was directed at you
14:32 <@isaacbw> there might even be a d3 channel
14:38 < pachet> isaacbw send #js your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to write maintainable code
14:38 < adamsmeat> Any recommendation on how I can still use php but use nodejs to append features, like chat.  I think all I need to do is use a port for it, but are there things I need to worry about when 2 processes communicate over different ports?
14:40 < pachet> adamsmeat not really
14:40 < pachet> it'll get to be a hassle maintaining sessions between node and php unless you get creative
14:40 < pachet> if that's even something you're worried about
14:43 <@isaacbw> probably the best way to do it would be to have node features on their own domain
14:43 <@isaacbw> but you would be insane to do something like that
14:44 <@isaacbw> someone should start a service that will send out an agent to physically slap people on their wrist
14:44 < adamsmeat> isaacbw: my host provides nodejs
14:45 < adamsmeat> isaacbw: i just found out about forever which will make managing background process easy. next step will be cache.
14:45 < adamsmeat> i mean session management
14:46 < adamsmeat> so you guys use expressjs or doing it with base nodejs api?
14:47 < fiws> i use expressjs. but i'm only playing around with it
14:48 < adamsmeat> is session management easy with node?
14:48 < adamsmeat> or should i leverage what my php is already allowing me
14:48 < fiws> express has sessions support build in
14:49 < fiws> but i was not happy with that. so i wrote me own
14:49 < adamsmeat> How does it do it, saving values on the server?
14:49 < adamsmeat> or just cookies?
14:50 < fiws> well.. both. cookies to auth the client and redis to store the session data
14:50 < fiws> at least i use redis
14:50 < adamsmeat> I'm thinking I will just use php to store session in server/db and then just set a cookie variable which will be used by my js.
14:51 < adamsmeat> I think I need to learn about redis. Is it worth it? Is it available in most hosting?
14:51 < adamsmeat> fiws: what test runner do you use?
14:52 < fiws> people like redis.. i just used connect-redis
14:53 < abenode> Why is replicating the NPM couchdb so difficult :(
14:53 < mscdex> abenode: because someone is always sitting on the couch
14:54 < abenode> seems like it
14:54 < fiws> also i don't run test xD (as i said i'm just playing around) but i like mocha
14:54 < abenode> stalled out on update seq 21826
14:56 < adamsmeat> ok, im using expressjs and can easily do NODE_ENV=prod node server.js to set the env. But I want to do it this way cli: node server.js prod, is it ok to alter the process.env.NODE_ENV value within my script so that I can make it dynamic
14:57 < abenode> Question... is there a way to pull down a specific update sequence of the NPM registry? I would much rather do that than a full mirror...
14:59 < SomeoneWeird> adamsmeat, most likely, just set it at the very top of your script, before all your require's
15:02 < adamsmeat> is npm install --dev installing all the dependencies of all modules and all the their sub modules?
15:04 < adamsmeat> windows is choking with all these long file directory nesting. why wasn't it made to have all the needed modules be installed in the root of node modules?
15:05 < abenode> No love on the registry question :(
15:07 < pachet> adamsmeat why wasn't what made
15:07 < pachet> npm?
15:08 < adamsmeat> yeah
15:08 < adamsmeat> why should it always be as a submodule
15:09 < adamsmeat> why wasnt just make them all modules in the root node_modules directory.
15:09 < pachet> different modules use different versions of the same dependencies, potentially
15:10 < adamsmeat> unless im wrong, im thinking that if 2 projects relies on the same thing, they will have to create a copy for each under their own scope
15:10 < pachet> if different things require('async'), how do we know what version to supply them
15:12 < nathan7> adamsmeat: https://npmjs.org/doc/faq.html#Why-can-t-npm-just-put-everything-in-one-place-like-other-package-managers
15:14 < adamsmeat> understood. i should be part of the npm team soon. :)
15:14 <@isaacbw> lol
15:14 < adamsmeat> just joking.
15:15 <@isaacbw> I think the root of your problem, adamsmeat 
15:15 <@isaacbw> is that you're using windows
15:15 < adamsmeat> I think so. But I still love this OS
15:17 < adamsmeat> but to be honest, using something like requirejs, i find no issues mixing libraries depending on different versions and still not making duplicate copies
15:18 < abenode> anybody use Iris NPM?
15:19 < adamsmeat> what is that?
15:19 < adamsmeat> sounds eye catchy
15:19 < abenode> i am trying to find out... 
15:20 < abenode> it apparently helps in hosting local registry
15:20 < abenode> (and pun noticed!)
15:23 < vlajos_> re how can i access the socket from an eventhandler if the eventhandler is defined outside of the socket scope?
15:23 < adamsmeat> seems the site cant manage my oauth login
15:33 < hellopat> Anyone have any experience using browserify?
15:34 < Qalqi> its a statistical observation that nodesters are in general sexier than other programmers
15:34 < spion> hellopat, yes
15:34 < hellopat> I'm starting to get into building my client side code using this method and I'm a bit confused as far as how to bundle with external libraries such as ember and jquery
15:35 < abenode> Does this make any sense to anyone? Getting this after running replication via couch gui client 
15:35 < abenode>  Replicator: error accessing doc  at http://isaacs.iriscouch.com/registry/, reason: {"db_name":"registry","doc_count":30767,"doc_del_count":2806,"update_seq":504609,"purge_seq":0,"compact_running":false,"disk_size":76775727239,"data_size":44912345243,"instance_start_time":"1369171406527444","disk_format_version":6,"committed_update_seq":504609}
15:35 < abenode> how is that a "reason"?
15:46 < nikkubhai> how to execute a function after another?
15:47 < nikkubhai> I mean run another function after preceding function has completed?
15:49 < nikkubhai> code: http://pastebin.com/zdYYvxxv
15:50 < nikkubhai> YOUTUBE is undefined  because the function console.log(YOUTUBE) gets executed before Meteor.http.get
15:50 < nathan7> this is not #meteor.
15:51 < nikkubhai> how do I call console.log(YOUTUBE) only after it has been defined
15:51 < nikkubhai> nathan7: nothing to do with meteor
15:52 < nikkubhai> I want to know how to exectue a function after preceding function has completed in node.js / javascript
15:53 < deoxxa> nikkubhai: your callback is executed long after you've done console.log(YOUTUBE)
15:53 < deoxxa> nikkubhai: (why is it in ALL COOL CAPS anyway?)
15:53 < nathan7> I thought meteor wrapped everything in a fiber 'n shit
15:53 < deoxxa> who knows
15:54 < nikkubhai> deoxxa: So, how do I make it execute before console.log?
15:55 < deoxxa> nikkubhai: you don't. you make console.log execute later than it currently does, by doing it inside your callback. also you can't just assign the return value of http.get to a variable and expect it to work.
15:55 < deoxxa> nikkubhai: probably, anyway. you're asking meteor questions outside of a meteor support channel so don't be surprised if the answers you get are wrong.
15:55 < nikkubhai> deoxxa: Your answers are right :)
15:56 < nikkubhai> I get my questions solved in node channel only
15:57 < deoxxa> nathan7: how's tricks
15:57 < nathan7> deoxxa: I spent forever debugging my fuse thingy
15:57 < nathan7> deoxxa: till like 4AM
15:57 < deoxxa> fuse is voodoo
15:57 < nathan7> deoxxa: no
15:57 < nathan7> deoxxa: you get passed a buffer
15:57 < nathan7> deoxxa: you hand it on to fs.read
15:58 < nathan7> deoxxa: the fs contains gibberish
15:58 < deoxxa> lol?
15:58 < nathan7> deoxxa: because your buffer wasn't passed back over dnode
15:58 < nikkubhai> In other way, my question is how to get the value of a function outside the function
15:58 <@MI6> joyent/node: isaacs master * 9c7078c : Remove .travis.yml file. - http://git.io/Pmzl8g
15:58 < nathan7> nikkubhai: that's not the thing at work
15:58 < deoxxa> nikkubhai: you don't
15:59 < nathan7> nikkubhai: the function is run when you have the result
15:59 < nathan7> nikkubhai: this is milliseconds after the code outside it finishes
15:59 < nathan7> TEMPORAL LOCALITY
16:00 < deoxxa> oooOOOooOOooo
16:00 < henrikhodne> You can keep the .travis.yml file in and encrypt the notification information, that way other projects can't use it.
16:00 < nathan7> Hey henrikhodne 
16:00 < deoxxa> nathan7: did you read about quantum entanglement of electrons separated in time?
16:00 < nathan7> deoxxa: not yet
16:00 < henrikhodne> Hola nathan7
16:00 < nikkubhai> nathan7: deoxxa: So in Meteor.http.get(url, function (error, result) {if (result.statusCode === 200) {  ....  } })    , how can I use the value of result outside it?
16:01 < nathan7> deoxxa: was that the wired article about two electrons that didn't exist
16:01 < nathan7> I think my browser crash ate that
16:01 < deoxxa> nikkubhai: you can't
16:01 < nathan7> nikkubhai: you can pass it on
16:01 < nathan7> nikkubhai: you can call other functions
16:01 < deoxxa> nikkubhai: well, not in the way you're expecting
16:01 < deoxxa> yeah
16:01 < deoxxa> ^ this
16:02 < nathan7> today I thought "hey, let's rebase this patch onto v0.10"
16:02 < nathan7> "..so that's what cherry-pick is for"
16:02 < nikkubhai> call other functions?
16:03 < nikkubhai> I am a total noob. :/ (issued in public interest :))
16:04 < nikkubhai> nathan7: How can I pass it on?
16:05 < nikkubhai> I thought i could by using a var YOUTUBE and returning the result
16:07 < nathan7> nikkubhai: it won't return anything
16:07 < nathan7> nikkubhai: it can't
16:07 < nathan7> nikkubhai: the result isn't there yet

16:12 < aendrew> Hey all!
16:12 < foofoobar> I'm using express.js with EJS. What is the common way to implement a template helper?
16:14 < aendrew> So, I'm new to Node.js but have been put in charge of incorporating it in my team's existing build process (Via Hudson). Any suggestions on how to do deployment? I'm looking at Haibu and am liking the cut of its jib (Being able to push an archive from Hudson to the staging and/or production server is really cool), but is there anything better or that I'm missing?
16:15 < aendrew> A lot of articles out there are at least a year old, and Node.js seems to be developing really quickly...
16:15 < nathan7> Hey
16:16 < nathan7> aendrew: Haibu works fairly well, but we're not porting it to 0.10 (at least we're not at Nodejitsu)
16:16 < aendrew> Interesting. What has the most community support for this kind of stuff? I've also been looking at Stagecoach.
16:17 < henrikhodne> So, I'm curious. Why did node decide to switch from Travis to Jenkins? We'd love some feedback on how to improve.
16:18 < bnoordhuis> nathan7: process._getActiveHandles() (and _getActiveRequests)
16:19 < nathan7> bnoordhuis: lovely
16:19 < nikkubhai> nathan7: ok. I got the problem. what's its solution?
16:21  * kenperkins shakes fist at magic
16:21 < ryannielson> Hey, I'm using express and have app.get('/', routes.index);. I want to pass additional arguments to index other than just req and res. Any easy way to do this?
16:26 < ryannielson> Nevermind, I just I just replaced routes.index with an anonymous function and called routes.index(req, res, extra) inside it.
16:28 < minibn> Error: spawn EMFILE
16:28 < minibn> why am i getting this error 
16:29 < minibn> on child_process
16:32 < bnoordhuis> minibn: you're hitting the file descriptor limit
16:32 < nathan7> bnoordhuis: Thanks, that solved my issue
16:33 < bnoordhuis> nathan7: no problem
16:33 < bbbb> film
16:33 < nathan7> bnoordhuis: test-http-upgrade-client2.js was hanging
16:33 < nathan7> bnoordhuis: and I couldn't tell why
16:33 < nathan7> bnoordhuis: what's the convention for node-core patches?
16:34 < nathan7> bnoordhuis: I have three commits
16:34 < nathan7> bnoordhuis: actual patch, doc patch, test fix
16:34 < merpnderp> ryannielson: is there something wrong with doing app.get('/', myextrafunction, routes.index); and then in myextrafunction setting your extra params in the session?
16:35 < ryannielson> merpnderp: Wasn't away you could do it that way, thanks for the tip!
16:35 < ryannielson> aware*
16:35 < bnoordhuis> nathan7: the convention is that it should pass `make jslint`, wrap at 80 chars, have a nice commit message (described in CONTRIBUTING.md)
16:36 < nathan7> bnoordhuis: But do I squash those three?
16:36 < minibn> thanks
16:36 < minibn> ill limit async
16:36 < bnoordhuis> nathan7: depends, not if they're separate things. in case of doubt, send as-is and we'll squash it
16:36 < nathan7> bnoordhuis: actual patch, doc patch, test fix
16:37 < nathan7> bnoordhuis: also, this is a patch against core http
16:37 < nathan7> bnoordhuis: I wrote it against master, but isaacs told me I should do it against 0.10
16:37 < merpnderp> ryannielson: you can do lots of magic in express. Like app.all('/admin/*', requireAdminUser); And then every route with the starting /admin path would call that requireAdminuser function.
16:37 < bnoordhuis> nathan7: okay, just send it as separate commits
16:37 < nathan7> bnoordhuis: I have both versions though
16:38 < nathan7> bnoordhuis: what do I do pullreq-wise?
16:38 < merpnderp> ryannielson: here's the TL;DR for the API docs :P https://github.com/visionmedia/express/tree/master/examples
16:38 < nathan7> bnoordhuis: since the 0.10 version clearly doesn't merge cleanly into master
16:38 < nathan7> bnoordhuis: and vice versa
16:38 < ryannielson> merpnderp: Oh cool, thanks I'll have a read through
16:39 < bnoordhuis> nathan7: maybe send one for v0.10 first? once that lands, send one for master
16:39 < nathan7> bnoordhuis: mhm
16:41 < nathan7> bnoordhuis: last but not least - is it okay to use global Buffer() or should I require('buffer')? (I need a single zero-length buffer)
16:43 < bnoordhuis> nathan7: it's okay to use the global. there's a zeroBuffer definition in lib/buffer.js btw, though it's internal right now
16:43 < bnoordhuis> what do you need a zero-length buffer for?
16:55 < minibn> is there any npm to resize image from url request?
16:55 < minibn> like localhost/something80x80.jpg
16:57 < duke__> what is a good method for having node restart on reboot
17:03 -!- mode/#Node.js [+o TooTallNate] by ChanServ
17:07 < duke__> is node-startup  a good tool for restarting node on reboot
17:11 < rhalff> mscdex, I finally got my upload working, do you think this is a decent PUT request for sending uploads or is it a weird way of doing it: https://gist.github.com/rhalff/008980b6545489fa0414
17:12 < rhalff> nodejs gives so much freedom it could be send in any form :-)
17:30 < nathan7> bnoordhuis: for HTTP upgradeHead/bodyHead
17:30 < nathan7> bnoordhuis: I'm getting rid of it because streams2 lets us
17:30 < nathan7> bnoordhuis: but for compat it'll need a zero-length buffer
17:31 < bnoordhuis> nathan7: you know the policy for stable branches is 'no changes, only bug fixes', right?
17:31 < bnoordhuis> if your patch in any way changes the observable behavior of the http module, then it's not eligble for v0.10
17:31 < nathan7> bnoordhuis: isaacs told me it could go into 0.10
17:32 < nathan7> 2013-05-24 00:18:40 +0200 <@nathan7> isaacs: I'll do tests and then pullreq
17:32 < nathan7> 2013-05-24 00:18:47 +0200 < isaacs> kk
17:32 < nathan7> 2013-05-24 00:18:52 +0200 <@nathan7> hmm..
17:32 < nathan7> 2013-05-24 00:18:57 +0200 < isaacs> nathan7: can be done against 0.10
17:32 < nathan7> bnoordhuis: ^
17:33 < bnoordhuis> well, i guess we'll see
17:33 < bnoordhuis> you probably can't use the zeroBuffer from lib/buffer.js though, it's a SlowBuffer, not a regular Buffer
17:33 < nathan7> bnoordhuis: mhm
17:34 < minibn> how can i write image file from http response? or http body

17:50 < neuro_sys> Hello, I'm only trying to build a project with npm: which is this: https://github.com/sidorares/vnc-over-gif
17:50 < neuro_sys> Can anyone give it a go? I think the build script is wrong.
17:52 < jaha> any done a multipart form upload via request.js in node? I cant seem to get it change the contentType to "image/jpeg" instead of "application/octet-stream"
17:53 < nathan7> neuro_sys: ..build script?
17:53 < nathan7> neuro_sys: npm doesn't do builds
17:54 < neuro_sys> I don't know about the terminology. I'm meant to be a user.
17:54 < seejohnrun> jaha: i think it's something weird where it's case-sensitive - check the issues, i think i remember something being in there
17:54 < nathan7> neuro_sys: npm install doesn't work?

17:57 < nathan7> neuro_sys: ah
17:57 < neuro_sys> oh, okay

17:58 < nathan7> neuro_sys: he's depending on an SSH git URL

17:58 < neuro_sys> compiling stuff
17:58 < bnoordhuis> Hoppertje: what do wordpress and node.js have to do with one another?

17:59 < nathan7> oh wtf
17:59 < nathan7> lol
17:59 < nathan7> neuro_sys: forgot the dash: npm install git://github.com/TkTech/vnc-over-gif#patch-1
17:59 < nathan7> This appears to work.
18:00 < neuro_sys> Okay, trying out.
18:00 < ManneW> Hi! I'm having a Mongoose problem. I'm having a model, "Beer", which extends the schema of "Product" (ProductSchema.extend, using mongoose-schema-extend). In another model, "Review", I'm having a reference to a Product. In the cases when this Product happens to be a Beer, that field won't get populated. Should I do it manually somehow? Or simply abandon the extension of schemas completely? :) 
18:00 < neuro_sys> eh, the cpp build breaks this time
18:01 < neuro_sys> I've got nodejs 0.8 though, not sure if related.
18:02 < nathan7> Yep, I'm seeing it on 0.10 too :(
18:02 < neuro_sys> I've got previous versions for nodejs on the repository.
18:03 < neuro_sys> for nodejs 0.8 and 0.10 it gives different compile errors 
18:03 < neuro_sys> will try with 0.6
18:05 < neuro_sys> what is this compiling giflib? 
18:06 < mape> Anyone had issues using node-gif ? keep getting Cannot find module 'gif' even though it is installed through npm
18:06 < mape> seems to be installing fine
18:08 < neuro_sys> mape: I'm just getting that atm.
18:08 < neuro_sys> How do you check what modules/libs are installed for nodejs?
18:08 < d4rklit3> how would one catch coffee-script syntax errors?
18:08 < neuro_sys> (if there's such thing)
18:09 < d4rklit3> if one does not use coffee-script directly
18:09 < jaha> ManneW: i think that is where the mongoose "populate" comes into play, check the docs
18:09 < mape> neuro_sys: you mean node_modules?
18:10 < ManneW> jaha: Yeah, but even when using the "populate" it's not correctly populated. I suspect it's because the referenced document isn't in the Products collection, but in the Beer collection.
18:10 < ManneW> jaha: Found out now that it should be possible to use a discriminator key instead of separate collections for the extension mechanism. So I'll try that :)
18:11 < ManneW> https://github.com/briankircho/mongoose-schema-extend#discriminator-key <- about the discr key :)
18:11 < ManneW> jaha: Thank you for taking your time trying to help! :)
18:12 < neuro_sys> mape: man, does this build for you? https://github.com/pkrumins/node-gif
18:12 < neuro_sys> it seems to be plain broken, if not a version issue.
18:13 < mape> neuro_sys: yes it builds fine, still can't require it though
18:14 < neuro_sys> mape: you build it with nodejs 0.10?
18:14 < mape> neuro_sys: still on v0.8.22
18:14 < neuro_sys> assuming it uses g++, I've got g++ 4.8.0
18:15 < neuro_sys> it doesn't build for some reason
18:16 < neuro_sys> http://pastie.org/7954317
18:19 < AnonymousPrime> this may not be a node issue at tis core, but in case someone else has encountered it: i have a node cli app that scrapes web content running on a windows server. runs fine from command prompt, but when run as a scheduled task, all requests to the data being scraped time out at 45 seconds and forever there after
18:21 < s5fs> AnonymousPrime: strange indeed. are you running the scheduled task as system or as a named user? can that same named user run the script correctly?
18:22 < AnonymousPrime> running as system
18:22 < AnonymousPrime> will attempt to run it as my account where it succeeds
18:22 < s5fs> AnonymousPrime: I'd retry as a named user (ideally the same acct that was able to successfully run the cli app before) and see if that changes how the task functions
18:22 < s5fs> if it works correctly, then you know you've got a permissions issue of some sort
18:22 < AnonymousPrime> thx, will do
18:22 < AnonymousPrime> very baffling issue :/
18:23 < s5fs> AnonymousPrime: I've seen lots of goofy issues like this that boil down to permissions. give it a whirl, I'm interested to hear the results haha!
18:24 < AnonymousPrime> s5fs: i'll let you know. and thanks for not immediately giving me sh!t for having to run this on a windows box :)
18:24 < s5fs> AnonymousPrime: hey, nobody's perfect ;-)
18:26 < mape> neuro_sys: hmm yeah doesn't build for me either after updating node
18:26 < AnonymousPrime> ran as same user and same thing. specifically, request fails with exception ETIMEDOUT
18:27 < neuro_sys> mape: doesn't build with nodejs8 0.8.23-1 either, for me.
18:27 < AnonymousPrime> it's like the network shuts down on the app when run as scheduled task
18:28 < s5fs> AnonymousPrime: are you trying to hit another local server? you could check the event viewer security logs and see if there are any failures for your user
18:28 < AnonymousPrime> it's a remote server. scraping data in the wild
18:29 < s5fs> AnonymousPrime: how are you calling your node script? did you wrap it with a .bat or .ps1 or just calling "node script.js"?
18:29 < AnonymousPrime> .bat file
18:29 < s5fs> okay
18:29 < AnonymousPrime> think i should try a raw call to node?
18:29 < s5fs> AnonymousPrime: naw
18:30 < macbn> is there any better alternative to node-imagable?

18:30 < jaha> mikeal: Hey, any idea why I cant seem to change the "content-type" of a multipart form upload? trying to push an image thats coming in as application/octet-stream
18:30 < s5fs> AnonymousPrime: i'd keep working your way down the stack. next up is probably the firewall, disable it and see if the problem continues
18:30 < nathan7> AnonymousPrime: are you doing a call in the batchfile?
18:31 < AnonymousPrime> what do you mean by 'a call in the batchfile'?
18:31 < AnonymousPrime> call to the node script? yes
18:31 < nathan7> AnonymousPrime: as in @call node blah
18:31 < AnonymousPrime> firewall is a good suspect, though why that kicks in on the same batch file that runs correctly from prompt seems weird
18:31 < nathan7> AnonymousPrime: or call node blah
18:32 < AnonymousPrime> oh no, not using @call
18:32 < AnonymousPrime> that's a good point
18:32 < nathan7> AnonymousPrime: there are some weird issues with npm autogen'd scripts
18:32 < mikeal> jaha: multipart is content-type: multipart, the individual "parts" in the body have their own content types
18:32 < nathan7> AnonymousPrime: if invoked from another process they seem to instantly exit
18:32 < mikeal> look at node-form-data to see the api for setting those content-types
18:33 < mape> neuro_sys: poked pkrumins on twitter
18:33 < jaha> mikeal: thats what i meant ;) if I set "contentType" in the options object still nothing
18:34 < mikeal> if its broken then log an issue in node-form-data
18:34 < jaha> it may be something up with their library just thought id ask yea since your were on here
18:34 < mikeal> there are like a dozen maintainers now, since felix started adding everyone who sent a pull request when he decided he didn't want to maintain it himself anymore :)
18:35 < mikeal> jaha: yeah, i've only used multipart like 3 times, which is the main reason i took felix's library for support rather than writing one
18:35 < mikeal> honestly, the api is a little awkward for me
18:35 < seejohnrun> mikeal: definitely
18:36 < AnonymousPrime> nathan7 no dice with call
18:36 < AnonymousPrime> looks like i'm on to the firewall
18:37 < jaha> mikeal: thanks for the help, ill dig some more
18:42 < s5fs> AnonymousPrime: gogogo!!
18:45 < mikeal> jaha: no problem, go ahead and @ mention me in any bug report
18:46 < dshaw_> #nodeup starting in :15
18:46 < s5fs> dshaw_: thanks for the reminder!

19:18 < bnoordhuis> yields: don't think so. a streams2 style stream isn't readable until you read(0) or resume() it
19:18 < yields> thanks.
19:18 < bnoordhuis> or pipe() it or add a 'data' listener so it switches to old mode

19:30 < AWinterman> it's hard to provide help to such a general question :)
19:30 < oti8> AWinterman: I know! Was hoping to hear : "oh. thats the classic JS require() decency problem" or something

19:33 < oti8> thanks pachet 
19:33 < rhalff> friends! when and how does a function call become asynchronious in nodejs? I have a function which uses an awessum s3 upload, I expect to be able to send my response from there, but node just happily continues, which is cool I guess, but I have a hard time understanding what part of the code is behaving asynchonious, I suspect awessum is doing it because I did nothing... :-)
19:33  * rhalff can't even spell asynchronious.
19:36 < pachet> rhalff io is async
19:36 < pachet> reading from fs, accessing some network resource, querying a database --- any time you ask for information from outside the current thread
19:36 < rhalff> pachet, ok, so uploading to S3 is doing that
19:36 < pachet> so in your case, you're dealing with an async service by virtue of s3 being a remote resource that node has to talk to
19:37 < rhalff> but when does anyone want to upload to S3 and not wait for it to be uploaded
19:37 < nathan7> rhalff: you'd be making the entire node process wait.
19:37 < pachet> you always have to wait
19:37 < nathan7> rhalff: no other thing could happen until that upload is done
19:37 < pachet> its just an issue of whether you can do other stuff in the meantime
19:37 < nathan7> rhalff: if it were synchronous
19:37 < rhalff> ok, so I should find some kind of parameter that makes the upload to s3 synchronious.
19:37 < pachet> no
19:37 < nathan7> rhalff: no, node doesn't allow that
19:38 < nathan7> rhalff: it would prevent your process from doing anything else
19:38 < nathan7> rhalff: it means you can't handle more than one upload at the same time
19:38 < rhalff> nathan7, but I have to reply a json message back to my system, so I should just pretend it was succesful ?
19:38 < pachet> rhalff im not familiar with the module, but if it's written with any kind of consideration for the psychic health of a node developer, it will accept a trailing callback argument
19:38 < pachet> so you pass in your own function as the last argument
19:38 < nathan7> rhalff: no, you send the JSON when it's done
19:38 < nathan7> rhalff: in the callback
19:38 < rhalff> hmz ok.
19:39 < pachet> s3.get('/path/to/blob.json', function ( error, result ) { if ( error ) /* there was an error getting the file */ else /* do stuff with the result */ })
19:39 < pachet> rhalff^
19:39 < rhalff> so the code of awessum-amazon-s3 should provide some callback somewhere, the last parameter right (things begin to dawn.. :-))
19:40 < rhalff> pachet, ok in my case it's a push putObject call
19:41 < pachet> s3.putObject('path', object, callback)
19:41 < rhalff> pachet, but I do send the response in that callback, but my code is continue-ing.
19:41 < pachet> so whats the issue
19:41 < pachet> let it continue
19:41 < nathan7> yes, you send the response there
19:41 < nathan7> that's where you know it was successful
19:42 < prawnsalad> anyone sue node-inspector often here?
19:42 < prawnsalad> cant figure out how to manually pause execution :/
19:43 < rhalff> wait, I'll just gist my top secret code to you.
19:43 < rhalff> https://gist.github.com/rhalff/087258b07086f4ea8a67
19:44 < rhalff> "We should never reach this point", comes before the response is send.
19:45 < zodiak> hrm. I see an '.end' for streams, but is there no comparable '.begin' or '.start' ?
19:45 < rhalff> Jikes, have to change my amazon key :| :D
19:45 < seejohnrun> rhalff: should reset those keys
19:45 < rhalff> yeah..
19:45 < pachet> rhalff keep those in a separate file
19:45 < pachet> and just require them as a config object
19:47 < pachet> rhalff anyway,
19:47 < pachet> sendToAmazonS3(res, path, contentType, imgBuffer, function (error, result ) { /* now we know we're done */ });
19:47  * rhalff :| Creation date: December 21, 2008 :| *reset*
19:48 < rhalff> pachet, Ok, I'll try that, thanks a bunch.
19:48 < pachet> i mean, you'll have to rewrite that function
19:48 < pachet> to accept that trailing callback like i have
20:00 < rhalff> pachet, ok, I understand I think, as long as I do not pass a next parameter (It's a connect function), and don't call next(), the function won't continue right?
20:03 < rhalff> the callback wouldn't matter I think, because it continues anyway, doesn't really matter if it's a function.
20:08  * rhalff hmz, the aws id does not exists in our records, a good thing actually.
20:10  * rhalff it works!
20:23 < dylukes> load: => @menu.show new (require '../views/menu.coffee')
20:23 < dylukes> what have I done.
20:23 < dylukes> browserify + backbone.marionette = shenanigans
20:23 < rhalff> dylukes, you started using coffee script... :p
20:23 < dylukes> I honestly only use it for the better function syntax.
20:23  * rhalff stupid answer, I've never used coffee script.
20:23 < dylukes> I have CAFD: compulsive anonymous function disorder
20:24 < dylukes> CCD: compulsive closure disorder sounds better
20:24 < ningu> I am pretty used to the standard js syntax by now, but yeah, it obviously isn't ideal
20:24 < rhalff> dylukes, cool that describes me very well
20:24 < dylukes> rhalff: https://coderwall.com/p/zw0kag
20:24 < dylukes> do _.bind → ...
20:24 < dylukes> :P
20:24 < pachet> :[
20:26 < rhalff> neh I don't wanna switch to coffeescript
20:26 < nathan7> Coco is kinda fun
20:27 < nathan7> CoffeeScript is weird shit. It's badly designed.
20:27 < rhalff> sass Is more useful I guess, although I also do not use that, but with sass you can generate all those vendor css automatically, which basically all look the same.
20:30 < rhalff> Bill Gates should just buy out webkit or something and force it upon explorer, he created it, remove that giant bug from our eco system if you will... :-) All try to be standard.
20:30 < ningu> nathan7: what's badly designed about it?
20:30 < ningu> nathan7: not to say I disagree. I've just never seriously thought about it.
20:33 <@isaacbw> bill gates doesn't run microsoft
20:34 < nathan7> rhalff: You can't quite buy out an open source project
20:34 < sambarino> lol
20:34 < rhalff> coffescript is just: Rails > cool > Ruby > cool > I also know javascript > Javascript > Make it look like ruby/rails > awesome... :p
20:34 < nathan7> rhalff: But hey, it's MIT or BSD afaik
20:34 < nathan7> ningu: https://github.com/satyr/coco/wiki/wtfcs
20:34 < rhalff> nathan7, I just wanted to make the point that Gates is responsible, he should fix it :p
20:35 < nathan7> rhalff: he doesn't work for MS
20:35 < rhalff> nathan7, yeah I know, he does do charity though, so I respect him a lot, I just wish he would try to save us also :|
20:36 < nathan7> rhalff: nobody cares about us developers, dear.
20:36 < nathan7> We'll have to care for ourselves (;
20:39 < rhalff> I just come from a background having to support IE 6,7,8,9 whatever, you put all your afford in it, and a client comes back, hmz doesn't work. A bug like that has nothing to do about coding, but makes you look bad. I hope we can save our children coders from such an environment.
20:39  * rhalff Gates cares, so why doesn't he fix our environment :| :p
20:39 < gluxon> :(
20:40 < ngoldman> drop support for internet explorer.. for the children
20:40 < gluxon> He doesn't have much control over his old company nowadays.
20:40 < gluxon> Plus, I appreciate that he accelerated computer so much in the 90s.
20:40 < gluxon> *computers :)
20:40 < gluxon> IE dominance was a cost that will slowly heal.
20:41 < rhalff> true, I don't blame him at all, I'm a nobody, I have no vote :D
20:41 < gluxon> Windows dominance is harder to fix :(
20:41 <@isaacbw> or more accurately, he doesn't have much interest in controlling it
20:41 < ngoldman> he accelerated consumption of personal computers
20:41 < gluxon> isaacbw: Gates and Melinda Foundation has a much more important goal anyway.
20:42 < rhalff> gluxon, I know. That's why I don't blame also
20:42 < gluxon> rhalff: IE does need to just die though :(
20:44 < rhalff> gluxon, dunno, or just a post on slashdot: IE moves to webkit in it's next version :p
20:44 < rhalff> but where is the money in that
20:45 < rhalff> money used to be about browsers it's not that era anymore
20:46 < rhalff> http://threejs.org/examples/css3d_periodictable.html
20:49 < rhalff> anybody has IE? does it work? 
20:49  * rhalff didn't use IE in ages.
20:52 < rhalff> let's all just relax: http://threejs.org/examples/css3d_youtube.html#amy whinehouse
20:52 < stagas> pcs actually decelerated computing by about a decade
20:52 < ningu> pcs?
20:52 < ningu> oh
20:53 < ningu> I read that as PCS
20:53 < ningu> I think I need more coffee
20:53 < progrock`> Hmm, who was it that recommended bourbon instead of compass?
20:53 < progrock`> Now I gotta see if I wanna switch from salsa to bourbon neat
20:53 < ningu> salsa and bourbon sounds like a bad combination
20:53 < progrock`> haha
20:54 < brycebaril> Hard to get as much on your chip
20:54 <@isaacbw> you misspelled amazing
20:54 < progrock`> yeah, google keeps showing food and alcohol comparisons... not what I was looking for
20:54 < progrock`> isaacbw: was it you who recommended bourbon?
20:54 <@isaacbw> I don't think so
20:54 <@isaacbw> are you talking about alcohol or some crazy hip package?
20:54 < nathan7> progrock`: wasn't it JohnONolan?
20:54 < progrock`> ok, I have no memory from 3 am conversations, llol
20:54 < progrock`> nathan7: I think you may be right
20:54 < brycebaril> At least corn chips + bourbon makes sense in terms of plant of origin
20:54  * nathan7 checks logs
20:55 < nathan7> progrock`: yep
20:55 < nathan7> progrock`: 2013-05-24 08:31:06 +0200 < JohnONolan> progrock`: if you get to the point of being interested in mixin libraries - checkout bourbon.io before compass (it's the same thing, but less shitty)
20:55 <@isaacbw> bourbon salsa could be pretty good
20:55 < progrock`> yup
20:55 < stagas> we had a graphical color desktop, multitasking and multimedia since 87 in the amiga. these didn't come until windows 98 basically for the pcs. that's a decade
20:56 < janmower> without pc's we'd still be sharing time on as400 or vax
20:56 < pachet> lol
20:56 < progrock`> I guess grid frameworks are simple enough, either should do... but seeing how I'm trying out bourbon for its mixins, maybe I shouldgive neat a shot... but, I will say, from my short experiece with Salsa, it was pretty damn clean
20:56 <@isaacbw> oh, we are talking about packages
20:56 < progrock`> yes, and not packages fo chips and salsa
20:57 < pachet> when it boils down to it, though, are they really that different
20:57  * pachet looks around
20:57 < progrock`> pachet: probably not.. but each has there own small reason why they made a whole new framework
20:57 < progrock`> their*
20:58 < ningu> progrock`: what exactly is a grid framework... do you mean css layout grids?
20:58 < pachet> oh i was just being inane
20:58 < pachet> food v. packages
20:58 < progrock`> ningu: yea
20:58 < ningu> has anyone else noticed that a recent version of npm doesn't print a trailing newline when you do npm install or update?
20:59 < progrock`> I will say, Salsa has an awesome responsive demo: http://tsi.github.io/Salsa/
21:00 < nathan7> ningu: we fixed that
21:00 < nathan7> ningu: afaik
21:00 < ningu> ah, ok
21:00 < ningu> I just did npm update -g
21:00 < nathan7> Yeah
21:02 <@isaacbw> how often you actually design pages like that 
21:03 < progrock`> I dont get why all these css mixin frameworks have reset, but very few have normalize
21:03 <@isaacbw> normalize 4 lyfe
21:03 < progrock`> isaacbw: responsize liek that, never, lol.. its jsut a cool way for them to demo
21:04 < progrock`> I don't like getting too crazy with responsive designs... confuses the user when they try to put a window next to another one, lol
21:04 <@isaacbw> all the intermediate layouts are terrible
21:04 <@isaacbw> the only ones that make sense are the full size and the smallest (mobile) size
21:05 < progrock`> isaacbw: yeah, but again, I think the point is jsut to demo abunch of random ones.. notshw you a viable responsive dsign
21:05 <@isaacbw> lol
21:05 <@isaacbw> okay maybe
21:05 < progrock`> lol, back to your "I need a new keyboard" comment, haha
21:06 < progrock`> ok, I'll give bourbon credit, they have some normalization, but they straight up say you should use normalize.css
21:07 <@isaacbw> I saw a reset script that removed font weight from bold elements
21:07 <@isaacbw> lol
21:07 < progrock`> hahaha, yeah... and honestly, I dont think you should reset margins on Headings... but thats my opinion
21:08 < progrock`> I used to just to the good old * { margin:0; border:0; padding:0 } for a good 10 years
21:08 < progrock`> but I've grown up
21:08 <@isaacbw> oh boy
21:09 < ningu> so I bought this cheap receipt printer and I've been programming it to print stuff out from node. it can even print cyrillic. but it adds an extra space after each cyrillic letter and this really bugs me even though I have absolutely no need for it to print cyrillic :)
21:10 <@isaacbw> sounds like you need to start hacking the rom
21:10 < ningu> how would I do that?
21:10 < ningu> I haven't opened it up yet
21:10 <@isaacbw> it depends
21:11 <@isaacbw> it would be a serious endeavor
21:11 < ningu> the problem is it uses GB2312 encodings and in that encoding cyrillic chars are two bytes
21:11 < ningu> and it makes every two byte encoded char double-wide
21:11 < ningu> makes sense for chinese
21:11 < ningu> in theory there is a command to tell it to move the current position backwards but it doesn't work
21:12 < ningu> otherwise I'd auto-insert that command in my script
21:14 <@isaacbw> you'd have to reverse engineer the assembly
21:14 < ningu> how would I even get access to it?
21:14 < progrock`> ugh, you guys are reminding me of m y horrid computer engineering days, lol
21:15 <@isaacbw> ningu: it depends on the hardware https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer_(hardware)
21:15 < ningu> hmm
21:16 < ningu> but it would actually be doable? this might be too fun of a project for me to neglect
21:16 < progrock`> using node/express with JADE, do the JADE templates get compiles on the fly on each access, or are they precompiled to html
21:17 <@isaacbw> ningu: probably
21:17 < progrock`> (maybe compile isnt the exact right word, but I'm sure you know what I mean)
21:17 <@isaacbw> but you would have to learn a lot before you could do anything
21:17 <@isaacbw> if it's an fpga then you're probably out of luck
21:17 < ningu> isaacbw: well, I know enough to read basic assembly, I realize it will be a different chipset
21:17 < ningu> progrock`: in the production mode they are precompiled, in dev they are not, iirc
21:18 <@isaacbw> but if it's a typical rom cpu setup you can do something
21:18 < progrock`> ningu: ok, perfect
21:18 < ningu> progrock`: but even in production it will detect when you've changed the template and recompile it
21:18 < progrock`> man, I am glad its been 5-6 years since I;ve done any verilog, or assembly for that matter
21:18 < progrock`> ningu: ok, thats what I was hoping
21:18 < ningu> isaacbw: how would I find out? I mean obviously I need to open it up but what would i be looking for?
21:19 < ningu> I guess I'll look for identifying names on chips
21:19 <@isaacbw> I only have a really tertiary understanding of this stuff
21:19 <@isaacbw> ningu: the chips are usually labeled
21:19 <@isaacbw> you can try to look up docsheets online
21:19 < ningu> yeah, I am aware of that, I just don't always understand the labels very well :)
21:19 < ningu> what I'd mostly be afraid of is (1) what I need to do to attach the programmer to the chip, (2) if I can backup the current rom in case I fuck things up
21:20 < aandy> offtopic: any ssl enthusiasts up for a talk? i've issued quite a few as my own CA, but looking to buy from a trusted CA, there seems to be a million different properties i never even considered. e.g. # of server usage, domain/organization validation (familiar with EV). are there certain things i should be looking for to assure they're issued from a trusted CA across say, chrome, firefox, IE?
21:20 <@isaacbw> there's seriously a massive body of knowledge you would need to be able to do this
21:20 <@isaacbw> it's nonnononononontrivial
21:20 < ningu> isaacbw: do you mainly mean to get the rom out with a programmer, or to actually do anything useful with it?
21:21 < kutchbhi> anybody using sphinxapi ?
21:21 <@isaacbw> you could probably get a programmer in there with enough fiddling, but reverse engineering both the hardware and the assembly would be pretty difficult
21:21 < aandy> kutchbhi: yes
21:21 < ningu> no need to reverse engineer the hardware
21:22 < kutchbhi> aandy: does the setfieldweight setting work for you ?
21:22 < ningu> I don't want it to do anything it doesn't already do, I just want it to do different things it already does :)
21:22 <@isaacbw> ningu: sure you do, or the program will be meaningless
21:22 < aandy> kutchbhi: haven't used it, sorry :( but it should be supported yes
21:23 < ningu> isaacbw: yeah, but it's like, find the code for action #1 and copy it to where it does action #2, I don't need to figure out how to program a new thing to do, necessarily
21:23 <@isaacbw> I wonder if you could interface directly to the printing hardware with your own mcu like an arduino
21:23 <@isaacbw> and just take out the stock controller
21:23 < kutchbhi> aandy its supported i think , but doesn't seem to have any effect. Is there an alternative ?
21:23 < ningu> huh
21:23 < progrock`> isaacbw: you definitely could.. just may not be super easy
21:23 < ningu> well that would kind of defeat the purpose of this thing
21:23 < ningu> which is to be portable and usable in the field
21:24 < ningu> a field where they don't speak russian... so I should probably just leave it alone ;)
21:24 < mape> neuro_sys: got it working?
21:24 < ningu> but I do want to be able to print accented latin chars
21:24 <@isaacbw> probably
21:24 < ningu> which have the same problem
21:24  * progrock` seesw ningu buying old stock tickers to keep track of git projects
21:24 < aandy> kutchbhi: do you have a chance to test it based on searchd instead, to see if it's a node-sphinx issue (or invalid api syntax)?
21:24 < mape> neuro_sys: I fixed it by adding some stuff, not sure if it is the same issue you have though https://github.com/pkrumins/node-gif/issues/13
21:25 < kutchbhi> aandy: sure 
21:26 < ningu> the plus side of thermal printers is that the paper is *super* cheap
21:27 < kutchbhi> aandy: ok , but how do I test this from searchd ? any ideas ?
21:28 < kutchbhi> i mean setfield weights can only be set from the api, right ?
21:29 < Validatorian> I'm curious -- a colleague of mine is suggesting using socket.io for an infinite scroll, but that seems like an odd way to use it. I've always considered socket.io as a way to pass data to the client when the server knows something the client does not, and not the other way around -- am I wrong?
21:30 < substack> Validatorian: it's bidirectional, that's a perfectly valid use
21:31 < aandy> kutchbhi: hmm, no, doesn't seem to be accessible from the search cli. bah
21:31 < echo|> Sets you up to receive new events without having to request them specifically or poll via ajax, etc.
21:31 < ningu> isaacbw: well it turns out the innards are very simple as one might suspect. there's a small board with an ARM chip
21:32 < aandy> kutchbhi: my theory was that your syntax might be wrong, so i'd check it in another library/language for debug - that is of course based on the fact that i'm not familiar with setfieldweights myself, no offense intented :)
21:32 < Validatorian> substack: Would you consider it a _proper_ use, aside from valid? Is it superior than just sending a request using XHR when needed, instead of keeping a connection open waiting for the client to ask for something
21:33 < Validatorian> echo|: The server doesn't know how far the client has scrolled -- it can't send any information without it being specifically requested by the client
21:35 < kutchbhi> aandy: ok I just checked the weights (console.log(result)) and setfieldweights does have an effect!

21:35 < aandy> ah, right. well that i can help with
21:36 < aandy> when you query the values (from the id's) you need to make sure you retreive (sort) so they're in order

21:46 <@MI6> joyent/node: isaacs created branch v0.10.8-release - http://git.io/05BvQA
21:48 < progrock`> So I'm making a jsfiddle clone (from scratch) thats gonna use socket.io for collaborative editing. I need to set up a database to work with node to store the files (and possibly the 'undo' history)... I'm not super familar with ace, so gott see how I wanna do it.. was originally gonna create a git repo for each code project... but thinking baout using a nosql to store instead
21:48 < d4rklit3> substack will probably never talk to me again
21:48 < progrock`> you guys think mongoose/mongodb is a good choice... or is there another nosql that may be easier (or more stable)
21:49 < aandy> progrock`: specific for revision stuff, i think that'd make a good case for using cassandra
21:49 < progrock`> can't say i'm expecting much of a user base, so it doesnt exactly need to be a production ready solution.. but then again, stablity and scaling wouldnt be a bad idea
21:50 < progrock`> aandy: well, i gotta research ace a little more.. I believe there may be an object that keeps track of the entire undo history.. in whcih case I could ismply store that object and the current state of the files
21:50 < aandy> plenty of dbs you can use, but i wouldn't recommend mongo in this particular scenario
21:50 < progrock`> then youd be able to backtack through every single edit
21:50 < progrock`> tho that may not be compeltely viable
21:50 < substack> d4rklit3: .on('error')
21:50 < substack> d4rklit3: bundle() returns a stream. streams emit error events
21:51 < progrock`> aandy: I suppose it may not matter, but the fact that cassandra is linked to apache doesnt make me super happy, lol
21:51 < aandy> how so?
21:52 < progrock`> aandy: apache always felt bloated, and I'm a big nginx fan.. but again, i take it cassandra is a side project and my feelings of the apache server doesnt really matter
21:52 < d4rklit3> substack, for instance, coffee-script just has throw error   when there is a syntax error. i want to be able to catch and handle that error. when i do try b.bundle(opts, function (err, src) { })  catch err     nothing happens
21:52 < aandy> that's a very generalized statement. you're aware there are *different* apache projects, it's not all part of the same binary?
21:53 < d4rklit3> inside the callback function the err object is undefined
21:53 < aandy> nginx isn't a database btw
21:53 < FooBarWidget> aandy: he's obviously talking about apache httpd
21:53 < progrock`> aandy: thats what i just said
21:53 < progrock`> aandy: that my feelings are based on the sever, which probably makes them irrelevant
21:53 < progrock`> aandy: I will say, I was looking for a nosql JSON based document store... not a SQL like database
21:53 < aandy> yet you're reluctant to use apache projects either way :)
21:54 < progrock`> then again, I do no SQL quite well, haha.. but trying to get away from it on this project
21:54 < progrock`> know*
21:54 < aandy> progrock`: that's actually why i wouldn't recommend mongo. how do you imagine structuring revisions in docs? (curious) :)
21:55 < progrock`> aandy: as I said, I think ACE may have a object that tracks every single undo.. if I just tag different states, theoretically, that could work
21:55 < progrock`> tho I suppose may not be the best approach (ie. error prone)
21:55 < nathan7> isaacs: yay
21:56 < progrock`> aandy: on the other hand, storage is by no means an issue right now (I'd be surprised if this thing ever hits 100 users, lol... tho you never know... but I could also redesign th architecture if I actually do get users)
21:57 < progrock`> so I could pretty easily store different states in different 'documents' and just havea main document that links to all of them
21:57 < aandy> progrock`: the reason i mentioned cassandra was for the composite key columns layout, where you'd have something like, key: value, slug_line: <unixtime1>:'some diff' | <unixtime2>:'another diff' | ...
21:57 < aandy> so i just wanted to throw it into the mix :)
21:57 < progrock`> aandy: ahh, that is cool
21:58 < progrock`> aandy: I'm only 'arguing' to dig into whether or not I want to use it.. not trying to put down yoru recommendation or anything
21:59 < progrock`> and I could deifnitely see that as a future upgrade.. but, right now I'm thinking I wanna use a simple JSON / key:value storage option
21:59 < aandy> caveats: it's java, if that's a deal breaker. it (can) use a lot of memory due to the way data is stored (a row needs to fit in memory, which shouldn't be a problem unless you have a *very* big slug with a log of edits, but you should be aware of it)
21:59 < progrock`> tho I do think it would be kinda cool to use git for all of that and have everything stored as actual files... just may not br super practical.. just would be a cool experiment
22:00 < progrock`> aandy: yeah, my intentions are to try to run this ona cheap ass vps until I decide to exand (if I do)... so a "heavy" java app isn't ideal right now
22:00 < progrock`> expand*
22:01 < aandy> git is usually wrapped, but i agree it'd be a nice way to go
22:02 < aandy> https://github.com/christkv/node-git seems to have basic stuff (like diff) in pure javascript
22:03 < nathan7> creatonix/js-git is coming along :>

22:07 < d4rklit3> substack, how can bundle() emit any errors if the error generating code literally throws and error and stops the whole application dead because i can't handle it unless i modify coffee-script compiler
22:07 <@MI6> joyent/node: isaacs v0.10.8-release * 30d9e9f : 2013.05.24, Version 0.10.8 (Stable) - http://git.io/iDrJcw
22:07 < progrock`> ningu: well, if I'm going to run a legit VPS, I'll most likely use rackspace... but with regards to a cheap ass vps, and one I'm using right now I got one from ramnode .... 512mb ram, 2 VCPUs, and 20gb of SSD storage... for under $5 a month
22:07 < progrock`> and so far so good with them
22:07 < d4rklit3> if the compiler throws and error bundle() would never know it
22:07 < d4rklit3> exceptions don't bubble in js
22:07 < progrock`> then for a SUPER cheap vps I got a 256 single vcpu one from vsace for $2 a month, lol
22:08 < ningu> progrock`: cool, I'll keep that in mind :)
22:08 < progrock`> ningu: just make sure you go to lowendbox.com for the discount codes if you do
22:09 < progrock`> I'd still go with rackspace for anything legit... very good API, let alone web based control panel for scaling, backups, etc
22:09 < progrock`> but I don't have anythign legit, thats not with my company, so no need right now
22:10 < progrock`> I just got a VPS the other week so I could get my shitty personal website back up (montev.com) lol
22:10 < d4rklit3> i don't think the questions im asking are that stupid.
22:10 < progrock`> ironically, with nothin else to show, my logo on my website got me a bunch of really good job offers
22:11 < NS|Glock_Coma> question = npm install dateformat is failing / there's 101 dependencies based on it / seems like the repository references is missing
22:12 < NS|Glock_Coma> is there anything i can do in the mean time to install it manually / make the other libraries i'm installing dependent on it not check the dependency?
22:12 < d4rklit3> substack, the answer is to modify coffeeify to have proper error handling.
22:12 < progrock`> ningu: I will say 6sync seems like a tier between rackspace and ramnode... not too bad
22:13 < ningu> progrock`: that sounds about right
22:13 < progrock`> ningu: just ramnode legitimately offers you more than what your money is worth... and so far stablity has been fine.  but again, any site that I was actually gonna make money, or be serious about, would most likely be on rackspace
22:15 < progrock`> ironically, this is my first project outside of work, that isn;t 95%+ static... been really enjoying wintersmith
22:17 < kaainaath> /join #node.js
22:19 < progrock`> Hmm, for user managmenet in a node/express app, think Passport is a good route
22:21 < progrock`> I'm not seeing what DB passport uses, if one.  And I'm slightly confused at what it does with Oauth/Openid... i'd definitely perfer to use one of them (why create website specific users when no one wants another suername/pass to remember)
22:21 < progrock`> But, I definitely wanna store user settings, as well as a list of files linked to the user
22:22  * wallbrik Image Share -> http://picshare.web.vu
22:23 < doomlaptop> progrock` the example use mongodb i believe
22:23 < doomlaptop> uses*
22:23 < doomlaptop> but you're free to use whatever you like
22:24 < doomlaptop> it's basically yours to implement
22:24 <@isaacbw> goddamn asshole
22:24 < progrock`> doomlaptop: gotcha.. well, I suppose that may lead me to choosing mongo for now then
22:24 <@isaacbw> -> wallbrik
22:27 < progrock`> ok, screw it, I'm deciding, I'm going mongo.. we use it at work anyway, so won't hurt to get more used to it (as much as I refuse to do backend work at my job)
22:27 < doomlaptop> sure, mongo is fine to use
22:27 < progrock`> I will say, 5 years ago I laughed at using JS on the backend, let alone for database interaction... but I'm really enjoying a compeltely JS stack
22:28 < doomlaptop> good to hear :)
22:28 < progrock`> then again between 12-5 years ago, back when I used to make a lot of websites, JS was a much uglier langauge (that is, the way people used it.. nto that the language has changed that drastically
22:33 < progrock`> fuckk no wonder I havent gotten the phone call i was expecting, fuckign phone dropped service
22:35 < d4rklit3> how does one hide the stack trace for an error?
22:35 < Havvy> Capture the error and throw a new one?
22:36 < d4rklit3> im tryin this
22:36 < d4rklit3> when i pass the error through the chain 
22:36 < d4rklit3> express still gives me the full stack trace
22:39 < gildean> d4rklit3: you have an error-handling middleware defined?
22:40 < gildean> like: app.use(function (err, req, res, next) { res.statusCode = err.status || 500; res.end(err.message); });
22:40 < progrock`> so is mongoose the generally recommended way of using mongo with node... or are there others I should check out
22:41 < doomlaptop> mongoosejs will do everything you need
22:41 <@isaacbw> progrock`: the native client is the official one
22:41 <@isaacbw> my opinion is that using an orm with mongodb is missing the point of mongodb
22:41 < gildean> progrock`: i like mongojs, it's a light wrapper on top of the native driver
22:41 <@isaacbw> the native driver is more or less what you get with the mongo cli
22:42 < progrock`> isaacbw: interesting, guess I'll do some research... and considering I am already familiar with the mongo cli, I suppose I probably don't need mongoose
22:43 < progrock`> I do like tho I wonder if there's any benefi of using mongoose considering I'm planning to use socket.io from LearnBoost
22:43 <@isaacbw> I'm not sure I see what they have to do with each other
22:43 <@isaacbw> oh, are they both learnboost?
22:43 < progrock`> ahh, the "I do like" was not supposed to be in the message
22:44 < progrock`> isaacbw: yeah, may have nothing to do with each other.. but both are learnboost products
22:44 <@MI6> joyent/node: isaacs created tag v0.10.8 - http://git.io/7Ke2RA
22:44 <@isaacbw> I don't think that should really be a factor
22:44 <@isaacbw> they aren't more or less compatible with each other or anything
22:44 < progrock`> yeah, I'm guessing that
22:45 <@isaacbw> their monk package might be worth a look
22:46 < progrock`> hmmm, now, what si engine.io, lol... I shall have to see if that will have any use for this project
22:46 <@MI6> joyent/node: isaacs v0.10 * f904d61 : blog: Post for v0.10.8 (+3 more commits) - http://git.io/hNmsNQ
22:46 <@isaacbw> it seems like you're designing your project around dependencies rather than the other way around :P
22:46 < progrock`> isaacbw: ahh, so monk is a lgihtweight layer that may make using mongo just a tab bit easier?
22:47 < progrock`> isaacbw: ehh, sorta... the project is more or less a chance to mess around with the dependencies
22:47 <@isaacbw> seems like it
22:47 < aandy> isaacbw: hehe
22:48 < progrock`> the project is more to expand me realm of knowledge/experience.. and end up with a product that could be convenient
22:48 < progrock`> s/me/my
22:52 < wao> so
22:52 < wao> bash-3.2$ nave ls-remote
22:52 < wao> Nave only supports zsh and bash shells.
22:52 < wao> any idea^?
22:54 < jesusabdullah> wao: try to find in the source for name where it tries to detect shell type
22:54 < jesusabdullah> wao: figure out why it thinks your shell isn't bash
22:54 < d4rklit3> what are the different write flags? like w and r, r+, etc
22:55 < d4rklit3> i need the flag to let it write a new file or overwrite an existing one
22:56 < progrock`> ahh, so socket.io is on top of engine.io... so guess all i need to care about for now is ocket.io
22:58 < bnoordhuis> wao: use zsh or bash? your $SHELL is probably dash or something
22:58 < d4rklit3> why would i still get "operation not permitted" for this: fs.writeFileSync(dest , src, {encoding:'utf8', flag:"w+"})
22:59 < bnoordhuis> d4rklit3: because the operation is not permitted?
23:00 < d4rklit3> but why wouldn't it be
23:00 < bnoordhuis> slightly off-topic, w+ (read and write) is kind of nonsensical to pass to writeFileSync
23:00 < d4rklit3> i want it to write a new file every time
23:01 < SpNg> what is the best way to decode a byte array into a string?
23:01 < d4rklit3> w seems to get passed that error, but then says "unknown encoding"
23:01 < d4rklit3> utf8 is unknown?
23:01 < _6a681> d4rklit3: I see you're still here. how's life? better? still ragey?
23:01 < _6a681> gah
23:02 < _6a68> that's better
23:02 < d4rklit3> i made lots of things work
23:02 < _6a68> nice!
23:02 < d4rklit3> wrote a new middleware for browserify
23:02 < _6a68> awesome! did you npm publish it yet?
23:02 < d4rklit3> that does what i want, despite how stupid others may think it is
23:02 < d4rklit3> no im refining it now so it doesn't error out 
23:02 < _6a68> ah
23:02 < bnoordhuis> SpNg: Buffer(array).toString('binary')?
23:03 < d4rklit3> i want to add a feature where it writes the bundle to a file if you want to... but im running into errors with writeFileSync
23:03 < _6a68> there's no harm in npm publishing version 0.0.1, then iterating. in fact, it's more likely you actually clean up the code that way.
23:03 < d4rklit3> im still in proof of concept stage
23:03 < corytheboyd> howdy y'all, the fundraiser for Request is ending soon https://www.bountysource.com/#fundraisers/251-request
23:04 < corytheboyd> if you're interested in helping out :)
23:04 < SpNg> bnoordhuis: ok let me give it a quick run ;-)
23:05 < d4rklit3> ok now its writing... i dunno wh..  but its generating a 1.3mb file for some reason
23:07 < d4rklit3> good lord, underscore and backbone are giant
23:08 < d4rklit3> _6a68 what should i call this middleware?
23:09 < wao> bnoordhuis: oh, yeah, I have fish. :)
23:09 < wao> env from fish.
23:09 < wao> jesusabdullah: ^
23:09 < _6a68> d4rklit3: that's the eternal question
23:09 < _6a68> I don't know what your middleware does, so I probably can't help
23:09 < _6a68> unless it's just the part that saves the bundle to disk
23:10 < jesusabdullah> aha
23:13 < d4rklit3> its bundles one entry file into a js file and optionally writes the file to the fs otherwise it just returns it on that route.
23:27 < durango> Anyone here use commander?
23:27 < durango> and if so, does anyone know how ot enforce options / bring up the help page if an otion is missing?
23:32 < samholmes> can I use connect-redis to store other random bits of data, or should I use something else?
