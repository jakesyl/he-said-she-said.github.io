00:19 < trevnorris> How do I specify the to node-gyp the version of development files to use?
00:25 < JosephFritzll> how to make a gay fuck a woman?
00:25 < JosephFritzll> shit her into cunt
00:40 < rook2pawn> isaacs: is there any chance that a repo like git+https://<myusername>:<mypassword>@bitbucket.org/<myusername>/foo.git can be specfied within package.json and installed through npm install
00:49 < AAA_awright> rook2pawn: I'd only use git: URLs
00:49 < JosephFritzll> f
00:49 < AAA_awright> (And submodules for that matter)
00:49 < JosephFritzll> how to make a gay fuck a woman?
00:49 < JosephFritzll> shit her into cunt
00:50 < owen1> i created a little service that makes push notifications to Apple. feel free to look at it and give some constructive feedback - https://github.com/oren/push-notification
00:51 < owen1> code structure/ readabilty / bugs / tests 
00:51 < owen1> mainly router.js, pusher.js and push.js
00:52 < owen1> there is one thing i need to figure out is better structure for my tests. currently u have to run 2 commands: NODE_ENV=test node server.js    and   npm test
00:52 < owen1> it's annyoing
00:53 < Leo___> Does anybody know another module other then pcap to capture packets? pcap seems to be broken for the newer versions of node.
00:53 < cxreg> fix it?
00:54 < AAA_awright> rook2pawn: Actually yeah, if you use a submodule, then you're providing a commit Id independent of where it may be downloaded from. I think you can even import the commit and its parents into your repository so it doesn't need to be downloaded.
00:55 -!- mode/#Node.js [+b *!*@176.96.167.187] by Nexxy
00:56 < cxreg> Leo___: it looks like mranney finally added another maintainer to pcap, maybe it'll get some fixes in the next few days
00:56 < cxreg> see https://github.com/mranney/node_pcap/pull/54
00:56 < cxreg> it's more than i can say for node_redis though :(
00:59 < Leo___> Hm.. Thanks for the info.. Is there any other way to capture packets?
01:04 < Aria> Leo___: pcap, node-pcap and cap?
01:18 < Engin> streams are not for public use ?
01:18 < Engin> I cannot assign a buffer to a stream nor can read the content afterwards at all
01:21 < muloka> hey... quick question why doesn't this work: https://gist.github.com/4582953 ?
01:23 < muloka> the example provided in the gist is pretty simple... ideally i'd like to be able to run the code offline if i had to.
01:27 <@Nexxy> muloka, https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom#how-it-works
01:28 <@Nexxy> from the docs it appears as though you can just give it a filename
01:28 <@Nexxy> maybe just try using './jquery-1.9.0.min.js'
01:34 < muloka> Nexxy: thank you
01:35 < muloka> that totally worked
01:35 <@Nexxy> muloka, sweet :)
01:49 < phI||Ip> I'm looking for someone good with nodejs/v8 - is there a site or list that is commonly used for finding paid help?
01:50 <@Nexxy> phI||Ip, craigslist?
01:52 < muloka> phI||Ip: http://jobs.nodejs.org/a/jobs/find-jobs ?
01:53 < phI||Ip> muloka very helpful, thx!
01:58 < owen1> anyone got 2 minutes for code review? server.js, router.js, push.js and pusher.js - https://github.com/oren/push-notification
01:59 < owen1> style/structure/tests whatever
02:16 < owen1> it seems like in order to test my code i should better make my server.js as a module that can be required. is this a good approach and are there examples for doing it?
02:17 < zomg> owen1: well your main application wouldn't necessarily need to be a module, but the components it uses should be
02:18 < zomg> in other words, your main.js or whatever would simply consist of mostly doing some requires and then calling some functions on those modules
02:18 < zomg> to initialize the application settings and such
02:37 < owen1> zomg: so my createServer().listen()  should be moved to a module and not in server.js?
02:38 < owen1> cming: ^
02:51 < shaofis> Is there a etiquette guide for posting a project to github that spun off of someone else's work?
02:51 <@mbalho> shaofis: use the fork button, include their license
02:52 < niggler> shaofis cite them
02:52 < shaofis> Do you leave them as the author in the package.json?
02:53 < niggler> you are the author shaofis
02:53 < niggler> its cited in the README etc
03:20 < yarco> what is ~ op?
03:21 < SomeoneWeird> is there a command line client for s.io?
03:23 < TehShrike> SomeoneWeird: I suppose you could run it in the repl
03:23 < SomeoneWeird> yeah, I just thought I saw a cli app floating around somewhere a while back
03:26 < yarco> what is operation "~" used for?
03:26 < yarco> anyone who knows?
03:27 < yarco> get it…..
03:27 < yarco> bitwise op
03:28 < brycebaril> yarco -- bitwise NOT
03:28 < yarco> yes. 
03:48 < aandy> yes indeed
04:55 < hector> Is there a way to tell npm publish to re-read the README file and update the npm registry?
04:55 <@mbalho> publish -f
04:55 <@mbalho> the website is cached for a few minutes though
04:56 < hector> good to know
04:58 < hector> thanks mbalho -f did the trick
04:58 <@mbalho> thank isaacs he wrote it :D
05:04 < phI||Ip> has anyone compiled nodejs as a shared library
05:04 < SomeoneWeird> wat
05:04 < SomeoneWeird> how

05:28 < node_00> Hi There, I am having an issue with npm install , which is resulting in error (http://pastie.org/private/hijbgxcof6f0hx5fecutkg) , I am running as root. When I go to /opt/code/shared/node_modules/toobusy and run "node-gyp rebuild" that says Ok (http://pastie.org/private/7jepshltdhs7fnihzi1uw) , Help!
05:33 < node_00> It worked!  by deleting node_modules directory completely and trying it again
06:30 < nanashiRei> How much sense does this make: Using EventEmitter together with Domains
06:30 < nanashiRei> Trying to be more "eventive"
06:43 < nanashiRei> node_00: next time try npm cache clean
06:43 < nanashiRei> always helped me with sticky errors
06:44 < node_00> nanashiRei: Thanks
07:01 < owen1> is there a convention whether to locate the module.exports at the end of the file or at the beginning?
07:03 < ljharb> owen1: i think you'll find supporters of both. those who prefer it at the top seem to do so because it makes it immediately clear what's being exported. i prefer it at the bottom, because it's like the return statement of a function, and i always check the bottom to figure out what's being exported from a module or function.
07:10 < owen1> ljharb: interesting. i also think that jslint will complain since you should have your function definitions before the the variables.
07:10 < ljharb> when it's at the top, absolutely yes it will.
07:11 < owen1> ljharb: yeah. too bad since i prefer the top option.
07:11 < ljharb> there's no accounting for taste :-)
07:22 < owen1> i believe there is a common practice to exit the process if error happened in my node app. is it true?
07:23 < GreenDog> depends on the error
07:23 < ljharb> owen1: any uncaught exception will exit the process - i wouldn't call it a "common practice" so much as "the way it works"
07:24 < owen1> ljharb: oh. so if my app can't connect to a db, i should not exit?
07:24 < ljharb> there's no "should" in play at all. if your app can't connect to a db, and you don't explicitly catch the exception thrown by your db driver, the process will exit
07:24 < ljharb> you just have to decide how you want your app to behave
07:26 < CrawfordComeaux> Anyone have experience speccing out projects & identifying the workload?
07:26 < GreenDog> yep, lots of experience. and i'm never correct
07:27 < CrawfordComeaux> ha!
07:27 < CrawfordComeaux> do you usually wind up overestimating or under/
07:27 < owen1> ljharb: right now i exit if mongoClient.connect call a callback with err. i need to think what other option do i have. maybe retry a few times?
07:28 < ljharb> everybody underestimates
07:28 < ljharb> owen1: well i assume you'd want your web app to continue serving a maintenance page or something
07:29 < owen1> ljharb: it's a web service (api) but i guess it will be nice to add to my /health endpoint whether the db is connected.
07:29 < ljharb> also to return a meaningful error code from all your api endpoints
07:30 < owen1> yeah
08:02 < owen1> i spend an hour on making my hello world web service testable. here are the app.js and test.js - http://hastebin.com/yeqecemoxa.js i basically expose 3 end-point to my service - setup, init and start -  any feedback?
08:27 < owen1> i just listened to Voxer's CTO at a podcast. he mention a feautre that many don't know - there is a way to use the node repl on a live app. can someone send a link about that?
08:28 < owen1> is it https://npmjs.org/package/node-web-repl#readme?
08:36 < [AD]Turbo> hi there
08:36 < owen1> [AD]Turbo: \o
08:37 < [AD]Turbo> :)
08:37 < owen1> what can we do for you today sir?
08:47 < owen1> sir?
08:49 < Raynos> owen1: http://github.com/Raynos/test-server
08:50 < CrawfordComeaux> I need to figure out how many people it will take to get a project done in 8 days...how the hell do I do that? :P
08:51 < ljharb> nine women can't make a baby in a month.
08:52 < CrawfordComeaux> true
08:52 < Raynos> CrawfordComeaux: it's generally (10 days + 10 days * people) / (people / 100)
08:52 < ljharb> lol
08:53 < Raynos> so if you have 50 people it's only 1040 days
08:53 < MI6> joyent/node: Fedor Indutny master * e2592cc : gyp: fix build with dtrace support on FreeBSD  Fix undefined reference to (+1 more commits) - http://git.io/hG9stg
08:54 < Raynos> where as if it's one person then its 2000 days
08:54 < Raynos> wait a second ...
08:54 < CrawfordComeaux> hehe...
08:54 < CrawfordComeaux> your formula's sliiiiiightly off
08:54 < CrawfordComeaux> typo somewhere?
08:54 < Raynos> but give this formula to your business people
08:54 < Raynos> then wait for them to come back to you :P
08:55 < CrawfordComeaux> lol
08:55 < CrawfordComeaux> and then fire them if they start giving me numbers like you just did?
08:55 < owen1> Raynos: looking into test-server. thanks
09:07 < TonkaTruck> Man…its 2013 and someone still needs to write human readable docs on commonjs modules.
09:07 < TonkaTruck> What utter chaos and shit.
09:07 < TonkaTruck> An embarrassment to the computer science community.  Fact.
09:09 < TonkaTruck> 2013 WILL be the year that someone will write a "Demystifying CommonJS Modules" post that actually does that.
09:30 < mboro> hi guys. any great resources on how to make sure both JS on the client and node.js on the server can share templates/logic to draw row items for example?
09:30 < mboro> for SEO
09:32 < fsfsfs> je7fdj4x
09:32 < fsfsfs> fuck yeah
09:32 < fsfsfs> time for a new nickserv pw
09:32 < Emmanuel`> hahaha
09:51 <@Nexxy> hunter2
09:53 < Doumie> i've created a game in HTML5 and now i'm thinking about improving my performance using nodejs
09:53 < Doumie> so i was thinking...
09:53 < Doumie> if i'd draw the canvas with nodejs instead of client-side-js and then push it to client for showing (using sockets.io for an example)
09:53 < Doumie> Currently the problem is, that i'm running into some performance issues with drawing / calculating everything I need
09:53 < Doumie> so I thought, if it would be possible to do all that and get the canvas to the client from nodejs under 25ms... I'd maybe win performance
09:54 < Doumie> Hm... I should stringify my canvas I have right now, and see how big it is in size
09:54 <@Nexxy> lol
09:54 <@Nexxy> good luck getting anything over the network in under 25ms
09:54 < Doumie> heh... yeah
09:54 < Doumie> i thought that too...
09:54 < Doumie> but it is possible... I mean 
09:55 <@mbalho> for best results use node.js over LAN
09:55 < Doumie> I tested so that I could ask my "tiles" 
09:55 < Doumie> from node
09:55 < Doumie> and I was getting 3-4ms for each tile
09:55 <@Nexxy> but why use tiles when you could use VOXELS?!
09:55 < Doumie> but yea... that was over LAN
09:55 < Doumie> because I have a 2d game? :p
09:55 < Doumie> or
09:55 <@Nexxy> 2d is so over
09:56 < Doumie> well I don't yet have the skills & time to make a 3D game
09:56 < Doumie> so I thought I'd start with 2d :p
09:56 <@Nexxy> tell that to mbalho 
09:56 < Doumie> http://projekt406.ee/codeblog/demos/booman3/ =>
09:56 < Doumie> arrows + space
09:56 <@mbalho> yea just skip to 3d, http://voxeljs.com
09:56 < Doumie> lol
09:57 <@mbalho> voxel bomberman would be sweeeeet
09:57 <@Nexxy> :o
09:57 < mscdex> voxelman
09:57 <@Nexxy> with his voxel buster
09:58 < Doumie> yeah... i don't know
09:59 < Doumie> i'd still stick to my 2d for now
09:59 < mscdex> multiplayer megaman in node.js!
09:59 < mscdex> do it!
09:59 < mscdex> :-D
09:59 < Doumie> so you laughed out the idea to transfer canvas from node to the client
09:59 < Doumie> alright
10:00 < Doumie> so let's say i'll keep the arrays of tiles small on the client side
10:00 < Doumie> but then i need a place or a way to store and/or recieve tiles i need
10:00 < Doumie> so i was thinking something like... nodejs + redis 
10:00 < Doumie> so i could ask for tiles from there
10:00 <@Nexxy> if only there were some sort of... localStorage
10:00 < Doumie> Nexxy that wouldn't work
10:00 < Doumie> i was thinking of that already
10:00 < mscdex> Nexxy: not if you're on ie5!
10:01 <@Nexxy> netscape 4 lyfe
10:01 <@mbalho> https://npmjs.org/package/idb-wrapper
10:01 < Doumie> i mean it's there, yeah.. but the store size is pretty small and lets say
10:01 < Doumie> i'd like to have bomberman with 1 million tiles 
10:02 < mscdex> over 9000!
10:02 < Doumie> i mean it's a stupid idea
10:03 < Doumie> but don't tell me it's impossible
10:15 < nvartolomei> Should I go with a pull request about this https://github.com/nvartolomei/node/commit/0b4381a42bc77ffee17741b93cc77cb86edfcb33 ?
10:46 < foofoobar> Hi.
10:46 < foofoobar> I want to port a small Ruby on Rails project to node.js
10:46 < foofoobar> Is there any similar template engine I can use?
10:47 < foofoobar> So I can keep most of the templates
10:48 < jacksmithz> CompoundJS is similar I think
10:49 < ljharb> EJS is the most similar to ERB, if that's what youre looking for
10:49 < foofoobar> okay
11:21 < Industrial> I know this is somewhat debatable but is there a consensus on what the smallest code needed in vanilla js is for implementing an event based system that works in Node.JS and the browser?
11:24 < Industrial> I guess I can just build an events[name][fn] with a .on and call each in events[name] on fire

11:46 < mukman> hey guys
11:47 < alitrix> we have a strange behaviour with a node module 
11:48 < alitrix> somehow, if you call 2 new objects, the share the same memory
11:50 < foofoobar> do I really have to use a second npm module to use a simple "layout" functionality in EJS?
11:50 < foofoobar> (layout fund = having a boilerplate layout where all my content is included)
11:50 < foofoobar> *func
11:51 < alitrix> http://pastebin.com/SsNjcxaV
11:51 < alitrix> this is a concept of my issue
11:54 < SomeoneWeird> foofoobar, you can do <% include file.ejs %> ?
11:55 < foofoobar> SomeoneWeird, on plain EJS?
11:55 < foofoobar> but then I have to to a <% include header.ejs %> and a <% include footer.ejs %> in each file
11:56 < SomeoneWeird> so?
12:14 < stagas> alitrix: that's expected
12:14 < stagas> alitrix: they're all using the same array, the one in the prototype
12:21 < parwan005> hey everyone
12:22 < parwan005> i am new to nodejs .. can you pls guide me how to install it.
12:22 < pullonpoh> http://nodejs.org/
12:22 < pullonpoh> Hit the big install button or see the documentation. There are no better explanations.
12:25 < solitude88> Need a node ninja
12:25 < asturel> how do i check is an var undefined? typeof rows[0].Weapons != "undefined" didnt works
12:26 < asturel> TypeError: Cannot read property 'Weapons' of undefined
12:26 < parwan005> i have downloaded the nodejs. cant figure out what next
12:26 < simong> asturel: you can just do if (!rows[0].Weapons) ?
12:26 < asturel> throws typerror too
12:27 < simong> is rows[0] defined?
12:27 < pullonpoh> I had the same problem with my app. I didn't find a way to make it work, but I'm sure there's one.
12:27 < asturel> simong i assume yes
12:27 < asturel> hmm
12:27 < asturel> i didnt do a check on rows length
12:27 < foofoobar> SO I'm using an jade template and I get the following error: 500 SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
12:28 < foofoobar> There is no reference to a line or an additional information related to the error
12:28 < foofoobar> How should I find out what is going wrong? ..
12:28 < asturel> thx, prob that was the prob
12:28 < asturel> and any idea where comes these: http://gtasa.eu/player/29 'parse' and '_typeCast' ?
12:29 < asturel> it just come after an upgrade
12:29 < asturel> i pass the rows to jade w/ 		res.render('player', { title: 'Player info', name: name , info: rows[0], col: cols, layout: false }); and do each val, key in info
12:29 < asturel> if i do console.dir(rows[0]) it doesnt put parse/_typecast
12:31 < SomeoneWeird> huh
12:31 < foofoobar> Any ideas how to debug this?
12:32 < asturel> foofoobar
12:32 < asturel> app.configure('development', function(){
12:32 < asturel> 	app.use(express.errorHandler({ dumpExceptions: true, showStack: true }));
12:32 < asturel> });
12:32 < SomeoneWeird> what's the error?
12:32 < foofoobar> SomeoneWeird, 500 SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
12:33 < asturel> if u use express
12:33 < SomeoneWeird> then yeah, what asturel said
12:33 < foofoobar> okay thanks
12:33 < asturel> i even do delete info.parse
12:33 < asturel> but didnt helped
12:33 < foofoobar> This does not change anything
12:34 < foofoobar> I already had a stack trace
12:34 < foofoobar> but this does not give me more information
12:34 < foofoobar> at Object.Function (unknown source)
12:34 < SomeoneWeird> now you debug
12:34 < foofoobar> SomeoneWeird, what do you mean?
12:34 < SomeoneWeird> test variables
12:35 < foofoobar> I now that it has to do something with a .jade file I am including
12:35 < foofoobar> when I do not include it, I do not get the error
12:35 < foofoobar> but if I had not guessed that
12:35 < foofoobar> how should I come to that conclusion?
12:35 < SomeoneWeird> that's debugging
12:35 < foofoobar> (and I don't know what the error in the .jade file is)
12:36 < foofoobar> but I'm confused that the stack trace is so completely useless
12:36 < foofoobar> I can't even isolate the error with this stack trace
12:36 < SomeoneWeird> so debug the jade file
12:36 < SomeoneWeird> remove half of it, see if the error still happens
12:36 < SomeoneWeird> if not, then it's the other half
12:36 < SomeoneWeird> rinse repeat
12:36 < caioketo> Hi there, I got a net server written in node.js, I wanted to know if there is some maxLength of the recieved messages, cause I got the client sending a message all fine, but when get in the server, after some position of the buffer it all got '0' value
12:37 < foofoobar> SomeoneWeird, wow thats a really bad way to debug
12:37 < SomeoneWeird> you're asking
12:37 < SomeoneWeird> if you know a better way, for jade, do it
12:39 < asturel> for me jade puts the line number when run into wrong indent
12:39 < foofoobar> SomeoneWeird, I'm just wondering why these stack trace is so useless. I come from rails and other frameworks and the debugging methods are a lot better than "hit and try"
12:39 < SomeoneWeird> foofoobar, i don't use jade, so I don't know
12:39 < foofoobar> What do you use?
12:40 < SomeoneWeird> ejs
12:42 < asturel> whats the best way to cache pages?
12:42 < foofoobar> SomeoneWeird, how do you realize layout files? Because I read there are no. Are you doing a include header and include footer in each template?
12:43 < SomeoneWeird> asturel, express does it when run in production mode
12:43 < asturel> ah
12:43 < SomeoneWeird> foofoobar, yes
12:43 < foofoobar> mhh, okay
12:43 <@Nexxy> layout + partials
12:43 <@Nexxy> foofoobar, there is definitely a layout
12:43 < SomeoneWeird> ^
12:44 < asturel> anyway in the newst jade+express i had to use 'extends layout' shit
12:45 < foofoobar> Nexxy, layout in .ejs files?
12:45 < caioketo> is there any maxlength of messages recieved from net socket in node?
12:45 < foofoobar> Just with a 3rd party module right?
12:47 <@Nexxy> foofoobar, layout in ejs, yes
12:47 < evbogue> I'm trying to figure out how to redirect a subdomain to a node server running at port 9778 on my VPS. Does anyone know how to do this?
12:47 < foofoobar> Nexxy, can you give me a link or so?
12:47 < foofoobar> I searched and only found deprecated stuff
12:47 < asturel> anyway u found it this _typecast and parser comes from the mysql driver..
12:47 < asturel> but why?
12:47 < asturel> and why console.log doesnt put it?
12:48 <@Nexxy> foofoobar, I just make a layout.ejs in my views directory and tell express to use EJS
12:48 <@Nexxy> it's all magical
12:48 <@Nexxy> n stuff
12:48 < foofoobar> oh, so EJS automatically makes use of a layout.ejs?
12:48 <@Nexxy> I guess
12:48 <@Nexxy> lol
12:48 < SomeoneWeird> lol
12:48 <@Nexxy> I never took the effort to figure it out
12:48 <@Nexxy> it just worked
12:48 <@Nexxy> so that was good enough for me
12:48 < foofoobar> heh ok
12:48 < foofoobar> I wil ltry it
12:49 < foofoobar> thank you ;)
12:49 <@Nexxy> but I'm just using 
12:49 <@Nexxy> express 3
12:49 < foofoobar> me2
12:49 <@Nexxy> optimist
12:49 <@Nexxy> and ejs
12:49 <@Nexxy> so I doubt it requires anything
12:49 < foofoobar> optimist?
12:49 <@Nexxy> it's only the best module ever
12:50 < foofoobar> Nexxy, light-weight option parsing?

12:50 <@Nexxy> ya
12:50 <@Nexxy> for command-line args n what not
12:51 < evbogue> So my subdomain is pointing to my ip address, which has a node server running at port 9778. How do I get incoming connections to my.subdomain.com to display the node app running at port 9778?
12:51 <@Nexxy> evbogue, add the port number to it
12:51 <@Nexxy> my.subdomain.com:9778
12:53 < evbogue> nexxy: I do that, but I want people who type the subdomain to see the app running at that port, without typing the port number themselves.
12:53 <@Nexxy> that's not how the internet works
12:53 <@Nexxy> you could set up a proxy
12:53 <@Nexxy> but there is no other way
12:54 <@Nexxy> (reverse-proxy, to be specific)
12:54 < evbogue> nexxy: that's probably what I'm looking for. I'll do a little more research.
12:55 <@Nexxy> evbogue, look into bouncy
12:55 <@Nexxy> if oyu want to do it w/ node
12:55 <@Nexxy> otherwise, haproxy or something
12:55 < evbogue> nexxy: bouncy is a node module?
12:55 <@Nexxy> https://github.com/substack/bouncy#routejs
12:56 < evbogue> nexxy: nice
12:56 <@Nexxy> you would just need to run your bouncy script with root privileges
12:56 <@Nexxy> (so it can bind to port 80)
12:56 < evbogue> nexxy: I think is exactly what I was looking for. I appreciate your help.
12:57 <@Nexxy> evbogue, :)
12:57 <@Nexxy> good luck

14:15 < flexd> Quick question: I have a web application (express/Ember.js) that depends on a USB RFID scanner being connected.
14:16 < flexd> To read cards with that I need to use a Python script. Currently I am running that inside the "main" node process, i.e the one that also serves the webpage. Would it be smarter to create a second process to run that, and then have some sort of communication channel between the main process and the card reader process?
14:17 < flexd> Like a FIFO or something
14:27 < brettlangdon> flexd, not necessarily, personally I would put it in it's own submodule and encapsulate it in an object or something
14:28 < flexd> Yeah that is basically what I've done.
14:28 < flexd> https://gist.github.com/0f55fe1533ab1b93d07b
14:29 < flexd> Like that currently, just wondering if that was a stupid approach heh
14:29 < brettlangdon> flexd, that is exactly how I would do it
14:29 < flexd> It does work though, I just was thinking I might want some monitoring to check if the card reader was alive or not. But I guess I could do that from inside the application too
14:29 < brettlangdon> unless there is a need to have it run as it's own process, why complicate it
14:29 < flexd> I was just thinking of the monitoring bit.
14:30 < flexd> But I can send emails from node anyway, so I could just make a quick check to warn me if it for some reason stops responding.
14:30 < brettlangdon> that, or you can have a setInterval run every X seconds and check the card reader
14:31 < flexd> The python script will exit if the reader is disconnected, and the node module will try to restart it every 3 seconds.
14:31 < flexd> I should check what other types of errors I could get, and if it is unable to start it after 10 tries it will email me or something like that.
14:32 < brettlangdon> nice
14:33 < flexd> https://gist.github.com/ef4647b4a3da4d43181a So at the moment I get stuff like this when its not connected.
14:38 < niix> Kind of a weird question but is there a way to include css files from the server side?  Instead of them being put in on the front end?
14:39 < flexd> niix: What do you mean? 
14:39 < niix> I'm not really sure either haha
14:39 < flexd> You mean to put all of the CSS into a file that is generated server-side?
14:39 < brettlangdon> to have server side serve the css files?
14:39 < niix> for example your server.js would have something that would require a css file
14:39 < SomeoneWeird> for what purpose...?
14:39 < flexd> Okay, but why? What would you gain?
14:39 < niix> and then that file is used for all the front end pages globally
14:40 < SomeoneWeird> no
14:40 < niix> just a thought
14:40 < SomeoneWeird> but you can have it serve static files
14:40 < flexd> What framework are you using?
14:40 < niix> nothing at this point, I was just thinking about it
14:42 < niix> I guess that would make it load slower essentially
14:43 < SomeoneWeird> why?
14:44 < SomeoneWeird> another 500ms startup time for most production apps make zero difference
14:46 < flexd> niix: What you could do, which is quite normal, is to both minify your javascript and css (essentially remove as much whitespace and other stuff as possible), as well as concatenate them into one js file and one css file.
14:46 < niix> right
14:46 < niix> I was just thinking what if you could some how include them on the server side and you wouldn't have to require them on the front end because some how they would be globally used
14:47 < flexd> No, that is not possible.
14:47 < flexd> As far as I know anyway.
14:47 < niix> well let's make it possible! :P
14:48 < niix> maybe for no other reason then it would be 'cool' haha
14:49 < flexd> I think a few of the "clientside" javascript frameworks (like Backbone, Ember, Angular and so on) do both clientside (full javascript, just json/data passed over the network after the initial load) and serverside (everything generated on the server and sent over as full HTML)
14:50 < flexd> Fairly certain Derby does that anyway, if javascript is not available. But that is something else entirely :)
14:50 < brettlangdon> niix, with a framework like express you can use layouts with your views, so you can have the css included in the layout and all of your views extend from the layout. meaning if your layout changes or your css changes then all your views will change too
14:50 < niix> brettlangdon: I use express for most of my applications
14:51 < brettlangdon> ok, then maybe I too am missing what your trying to do
15:08 < danmactough> Node code documentation says that util module stability is "Locked." Does that include util._extends and util.deprecate, which are not documented?

15:25 < andrepadez> hi, can anyone tell me what the irc channel is for jade templates?
15:30 < brettlangdon> andrepadez, if you ask your question here, someone might be able to answer it
15:30 < _ior> i'mma try again with this question: i'm using formidable to get a file and insert it into a bytea column in a postgres db. if i use formidable's default behaviour of writing file to disk (with WriteStream.write(buffer)) and then read the file from disk to put it in the db, all is good
15:30 < _ior> however, i want to skip disk writing
15:30 < _ior> so i overrode the onPart() method of formidable to buffer all data events until 'end' is received, then shove that in the db
15:31 < _ior> and i get errors like: error: invalid byte sequence for encoding "UTF8": 0x00
15:31 < klaemo_> hey, so i'm using nano + jsonstream to fetch and transform couchdb responses, but when I pipe the result to the response object of the http request I lose the couchdb headers like etag. any idea how to avoid this?
15:32 < _ior> which i can't figure out, because i'm not changing the encoding anywhere (and neither is formidable's default behaviour, so far as i can tell)
15:33 < andrepadez> brettlangdon: ok, i will put it in a GIST, thanks
15:36 < andrepadez> If someone can help me with a Jade question: https://gist.github.com/4586869  i would very much appreciated
15:37 < holzp> where is isAdax coming from?
15:37 < holzp> isAjax
15:38 < andrepadez> i pass it in the data object when i render the view; it comes for a query string
15:39 < holzp> im not great with Jade (yet) but does the part under the -if need to be indented?
15:39 < holzp> line 4
15:39 < jholloman> I'm having a basic issue with NPM, I just updated node to v0.8.18 and npm to v1.2.2 (Windows 7x64) Now when I try to npm install I get "Error: no 'name' field..." for all modules. Is this familiar to anyone?
15:39 < andrepadez> holzp: sorry, it is indented, bad copy/paste
15:39 < holzp> well i guess it is, does it need to be indented more?
15:40 < holzp> im windering if isAjax is actually defined
15:40 < gildean> andrepadez: iirc you can't use the extends-statement within an if-statement
15:40 < holzp> or that :/
15:41 < gildean> i think there was a convo about this on the express channel few days ago
15:41 < andrepadez> it is undefined if it doesn't come from the query string, but it works when i use it in the dochead.jade template, in the second paste of the gist
15:42 < andrepadez> (the same condition works fine)*
15:43 < holzp> andrepadez: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11041168/nodejs-jade-conditional-extend
15:43 < holzp> perhaps thats the issue?
15:45 < tonka> /list
15:46 < _ior> so... anyone have any suggestions on how i can test encodings to find out where my buffering differs from a plain old writestream?
15:46 < andrepadez> holzp: thanks very much, i really thought i had hit a dead end, and i guess i did :)
15:47 < holzp> np, I find that a lot with some of the node-related stuff, its still very new
15:51 < iwalkbarefoot> andrepadez: You could simply move the conditional inside the template.  technically the extend would still be processed but it would achieve what you desire
15:51 < iwalkbarefoot> unless that's what you were describing below

16:08 < cloudbender> I have a deployment question
16:09 < cloudbender> Or maybe I should say a newbie question
16:11 < isaacbw> do you guys think it would be a terrible idea to check a redis store for session info with every api request
16:11 < isaacbw> assuming lots of api requests
16:12 < cloudbender> Can someone help a node beginner ?
16:12 < brycebaril> isaacbw -- what does redis-benchmark say? I'm sure you're fine.
16:13 < brycebaril> my laptop can do about 100k redis ops per second, your api server probably can't
16:13 < brycebaril> cloudbender -- ask and someone may be able to answer
16:13 < isaacbw> alright cool, thanks brycebaril 
16:14 < cloudbender> OK but first is there a better chat client, other than the web-based client ?
16:14 < holzp> lots
16:14 < holzp> search google for IRC clients
16:14 < cloudbender> ok tnx
16:14 < isaacbw> mirc and xchat/variants are the big ones
16:15 < isaacbw> whatever the modern fork of xchat is
16:15 < cloudbender> tnx isaac
16:15 < ryah_> node people - this is awesome http://grobie.github.com/soundcloud2000/
16:15 < ryah_> someone should write this in node - so that it can be x-platform
16:16 < isaacbw> hah
16:16 < isaacbw> it servers 0 purpose
16:16 < isaacbw> *serves
16:16 < isaacbw> as cool as it is
16:16 < ryah_> the best hacks serve zero purpose
16:17 < niix> hmm interesting, I'm looking for something new to make a node module out of
16:17 < isaacbw> that doesn't mean they should be ported
16:18 < ryah_> node has really good  x-platform terminal support
16:18 < ryah_> you'd have to figure out the audio stuff though
16:19 < isaacbw> most language have good cross platform support through ncurses though
16:19 < isaacbw> s
16:19 < isaacbw> man, typing is hard
16:20 < isaacbw> I think my laptop is going
16:20 < niix> my desk is right by the bathrooom and I smell crap all day long.  Does this make me more or less productive?
16:20 < isaacbw> too many nights falling asleep with it on my belly and having it slip to the floor
16:20 < isaacbw> niix, pretend the crap smell is actually coffee
16:20 < niix> hah
16:20 < niix> it's certainly coffee induced
16:24 < isaacbw> I fell asleep naked last night and woke up to the cleaning lady in my apartment
16:24 < cloudbender> What was she singing ?
16:24 < holzp> isaacbw, sounds like the start of a RomCom
16:24 < isaacbw> haha
16:25 < isaacbw> it really does
16:25 < isaacbw> cloudbender, I don't know, she doesn't speak english
16:25 < isaacbw> she comes with the building. I wouldn't hire a cleaner myself
16:25 < cloudbender> Hope she at least made you some taters, eggs, and toast.
16:26 < isaacbw> no man, she was washing the kitchen when I wanted to be making my eggs :(
16:26 < isaacbw> I got so hungry
16:26 < holzp> firstworldproblems
16:28 < cloudbender> OK so I'm configuring xchat, will be back soon.
16:44 < cloudbender> xchat : is there a way to suppress the network information from each chat line ?
16:45 < cloudbender> and the quit/join messages ?
16:45 < isaacbw> yea, somewhere
16:46 < isaacbw> I don't know what you mean about network information though
16:46 < isaacbw> but you can hide join/show messages for sure
16:46 < cloudbender> k tnx I'll find it
16:47 < isaacbw> *quit
16:47 < isaacbw> man, thinking is hard
16:53 < cloudbender> I see, SET commands are the thing ...
16:56 < cloudbender> ok clean quit to save settings. Gotta do some biz, bbl.

17:25 < ajostergaard> hello
17:25 < ajostergaard> can anybody tell me where the node command line options are documented? in particular the defaults
17:31 < flexd> ajostergaard: Most likely in here? http://nodejs.org/api/
17:32 < ajostergaard> yes but where - believe me - i've looked
17:32 < ajostergaard> then again i obviously haven't looked hard enough or i'd have found too
17:32 < ajostergaard> :(
17:33 < isaacbw> 'man node'
17:33 < isaacbw> ajostergaard, are you on linux
17:34 < ajostergaard> unfortunately not but now that you mention 'man' i'll get there - think i was just having a brainnumb moment (or day)
17:34 < ajostergaard> thanks
17:34 < isaacbw> here, I made it easy for you: http://pastebin.com/jw4axTxj
17:34 < flexd> ajostergaard: Sorry for assuming you had not looked, a lot of people do not :-)
17:34 < isaacbw> tell me you love me
17:35 < ajostergaard> awesome - thank you - i love you!
17:35 < ajostergaard> lol
17:35 < isaacbw> :D
17:35 < ajostergaard> how can it be that it's not on nodejs.org?!? i guess it's buried on github?
17:35 < flexd> isaacbw: I do not strongly feel either love or hate towards you. It's approaching equilibrium. :-P
17:36 < isaacbw> that's a start I suppose
17:36 < ajostergaard> rofl
17:36 < flexd> :-D
17:37 < ajostergaard> next question … any documentation to go with the options? ;)
17:39 < ajostergaard> i did find the options on github in main.cc but it's not always clear what they really do
17:40 < asturel> is there a way to remove prototypes from a variable?
17:40 < asturel> i mean when i pass the mysql result row into jade it has parse and _typecast prototype function
17:41 < asturel> and if i do each ... in row it will go throught it
17:42 < foofoobar> Nexxy, several hours ago you gave me the tip that I can just use a layout.ejs file and its "magically" used for the other files as a layout
17:42 < foofoobar> how do I have to mark in the layout.ejs file where the "body" is?
17:44 < holzp> asture => checkout Object.hasownproperty method
17:45 < holzp> that will at least tell you which is local and which goes up the proto chain
17:50 < foofoobar> I read that the layout functionality was remove from express 3.x and therefore you should use express-partials
17:50 < isaacbw> or the include tools in the template language
17:51 < geNAZt> hi
17:51 < isaacbw> ahoy
17:53 < asturel> holzp but cant i just remove it?
17:53 < asturel> i tried to set it null but fail :D
17:54 < holzp> screwing with the prototype screws with all the other objects too
17:55 < asturel> but it applied by the mysql driver
17:55 < asturel> mysql/2.0.0-alpha5/package/lib/protocol/packets/RowDataPacket.js
17:55 < asturel> RowDataPacket.prototype.parse = function(parser, fieldPackets, typeCast, nestTables, connection) {
17:55 < asturel> and RowDataPacket.prototype._typeCast = function(field, parser, timeZone) {
17:56 < holzp> yeah but you dont really know what the library is doing with it
17:56 < holzp> so you shouldnt go about removing stuff from its prototype
17:56 < baptistem> o/
17:56 < holzp> you wont be just removing it for that instance, but all existing instances
17:57 < asturel> then how do i pass proper data to jade?
17:57 < baptistem> 2 questions for you guys, 1. does anyone use log.io ? 2. if no how can I uninstall easily something with npm? (if there is a better chan please point it and put shame on me :D )
17:58 < context> baptistem: npm help uninstall
17:59 < holzp> not sure in that case, but if you are trying to loop on all local properties, then you should check .hasOwnProperty for "localness"
17:59 < holzp> perhaps do a for loop
17:59 < holzp> for your data than a foreach
18:00 < baptistem> context: I tried it but it's trying to get into the nodes_modules folder (which isn't existing)
18:00 < holzp> baptistem, be in the directory that has that directory in it?
18:00 < context> baptistem: so what are you trying to remove...
18:01 < context> you cant remove what doesnt exist
18:01 < baptistem> mmh during installation there was an option -g and --prefix=/usr/local/
18:01 < context> baptistem: so do uninstall -g
18:02 < asturel> Cannot read property 'hasOwnProperty' of null
18:02 < baptistem> that simple? damn lemme try
18:03 -!- mode/#Node.js [+o TooTallNate] by ChanServ
18:04 < baptistem> ok, uninstall done, I guess I should remove by hand the link made in bin folder
18:04 < baptistem> thx context  holzp 
18:06 < holzp> asturel, the mysql return object is null?
18:07 < asturel> no
18:08 < asturel> i tried on rows[0][key]
18:08 < holzp> what are you trying to loop on? rows or rows[0]?
18:08 < foofoobar> How to include in .ejs from a subfolder?

18:15 < asturel> but i cant iterate it with numbers
18:15 < holzp> or try info.hasownproperty(key)
18:15 < nanashiRei> can't get it to do anything. File/streams/pipes nothing works
18:16 < asturel> but i didnt go forward with that?
18:16 < holzp> unsure what the library is exactly giving you as the info object
18:16 < isaacbw> my hair smells like
18:16 < isaacbw> nice
18:16 < holzp> but its probably iteratable its a database row
18:16 < asturel> res.render('player', { title: 'Player info', name: name , info: rows[0], col: cols, layout: false });
18:16 < holzp> info.hasownproperty tells you if the property belongs to info or if it is part of the .prototype of info
18:16 < asturel> and the rows[0] is an associative array
18:17 < holzp> can you print out info somewhere?
18:17 < asturel> yeah
18:17 < holzp> so we can see whats  in it
18:17 < asturel> before i pass it or in nodejs?
18:17 < asturel> in jade*
18:17 < holzp> do it in node
18:17 < asturel> it doesnt seems in node
18:17 < holzp> so we can see what the properties actually are
18:17 < asturel> i tried it already with console.dir
18:18 < asturel> http://pastebin.com/bYfN53Wr
18:18 -!- mode/#Node.js [+o TooTallNate] by ChanServ
18:19 < asturel> maybe the issue is related to jade?
18:19 < isaacbw> I don't understand the appeal of jade
18:19 < isaacbw> you get to write a few less brackets
18:20 < holzp> well the templating is nice too
18:20 < asturel> yea
18:20 < asturel> h
18:20 < isaacbw> oh
18:20 < asturel> and blocking support
18:20 < asturel> u can add blocks in the layout
18:20 < asturel> and extends it from the page
18:21 < asturel> e.g. add scripts to headers
18:21 < asturel> so basicly the page.jade only contains the page related things
18:21 < holzp> yeah, try hasownproperty if you are pickupg up stuff from the prototype you dont want
18:21 < isaacbw> I see
18:22 < holzp> if(info.hasOwnProperty(key))
18:22 < Orbitrix> anyone have an example of promis-based flow control using Redis for node?
18:22 < isaacbw> I want a huge monitor
18:23 < asturel> holzp but what i win with that?
18:23 < isaacbw> 1366x768 is starting to feel cramped
18:23 < holzp> instead of line if
18:23 < asturel> i just dont want to print the prototype functions
18:23 < holzp> 15
18:23 < asturel> now it bloats the function
18:23 < holzp> right
18:23 < Orbitrix> i'm having a real hard time chosing the right asynchronous flow control library, and getting it to work right with Redis, any suggestions?
18:23 < asturel> into the page :D
18:23 < isaacbw> flow is pretty, Orbitrix 
18:23 < holzp> .hasownproperty will tell you if the key'd valueis coming from the .prototype or not
18:23 < asturel> ah ok
18:24 < CrawfordComeaux> Quick poll: Is this something you'd fund to get to play with and if so, how much would you put in? If not, what could be offered to change your mind - I want to setup a crowdfunding campaign for setting up a system that lets devs play with all social media data related to the super bowl or geotagged as coming from New Orleans from 1/26-2/4. Devs would be able to submit their own data processing components (for www.storm-project.org) or dashboard 
18:24 < CrawfordComeaux> widgets w/custom queries attached to them. 
18:24 < holzp> its ugly butnecessary if you are picking up strays
18:24 < holzp> Orbitrix, I used async with redis to great success
18:24 < Orbitrix> word
18:25 < asturel> holzp returns true
18:25 < asturel> -if (info.hasOwnProperty)
18:25  * holzp always tries to return truth
18:25 < holzp> nono, if (info.hasOwnProperty(key))
18:25 < asturel> ah
18:26 < holzp> you are trying to see if the property of info actually belongs to that instance or to the prototype of that instance
18:26 < asturel> false
18:26 < asturel> -if (info.hasOwnProperty('parse'))
18:28 < holzp> asturel, sortof, you are really looking on those keys
18:28 < asturel> u mean
18:28 < asturel> the array keys?:D
18:29 < holzp> well whatever that object is yeah, the result set
18:29 < asturel> it says true for every key
18:29 < holzp> as you iterate through the properties you check to see if the property is it's own: info.hasOwnProperty(key)
18:29 < asturel> http://gtasa.eu/player/16018
18:30 < Orbitrix> i swear half the nodejs is writing actual software, while the other half is writing flow control libraries
18:30 < Jhsto> Hi folks, I'd like to know how much is the average hourly pay for a nodejs programmer?
18:30 < Orbitrix> nodejs community*
18:30 < holzp> thats what you wanted right?
18:30 < asturel> ah.. ok :D
18:30 < asturel> thanks
18:30 < Jhsto> Im supposed to hit my first client tomorrow and I have no idea what to ask for
18:30 < holzp> all the keys from the db none of the functions from the prototype?
18:30 < holzp> protip: don't punch your clients
18:31 < asturel> -if (!info.hasOwnProperty(key)) continue; worked
18:31 < asturel> but it isnt nice :D
18:31 < isaacbw> why would you hit a client
18:31 < isaacbw> that's no way to keep a contract
18:31 < Jhsto> Lol this is little different occasion
18:31 < holzp> it isnt nice, but what prototype gives you is so nice it actually worth it
18:31 < isaacbw> where hitting people is how you get contracts?
18:31 < isaacbw> I want in
18:32 < isaacbw> anyway, pay depends on your skills, not the fact that it's node.js
18:32 < Jhsto> I had a chance to start a company for one year, so i took it and now my school wants me to make their website for them.
18:32 < holzp> nodejs is too new to really have a"nodejs programmer" generally you are paid against your skillset
18:32 < etcetera> is there an example app that highlights node.js best practices?
18:32 < isaacbw> what you should do is think about how much you want a month, then estimate how long the project will take, and use that to make an hourly wage
18:33 < isaacbw> it's also a bidding game, where if you ask for too much, they might find someone else
18:33 < isaacbw> so think about what your skills are and how much the client is looking to pay
18:33 < holzp> well hang on
18:33 < holzp> try to figure out how much it is worth to them too
18:33 < isaacbw> yea
18:33 < Jhsto> The thing is that they wont find someone else, they are making it to kickstart my 'business'.
18:33 < isaacbw> it might be worth lowballing it just to get connections
18:34 < holzp> I guess if I was the school I would say, why are we doing this in node, i can get a php guy for half the cost
18:34 < isaacbw> then just have a conversation with them
18:34 < Jhsto> Thanks isaac, ill consider those things
18:34 < isaacbw> if they say that about php, you should turn visibly red and start breaking things until they agree to hire you
18:35 < Jhsto> Well I could do it with PHP with some random third party template on it, but that's no fun.
18:35 < isaacbw> I feel like you aren't listening to me
18:35 < holzp> if you are serious about starting a business you need to think about your clients too
18:35 < holzp> may not be fun for you,, but node.js will really limit their pool of programmers as well as deployment
18:36 < isaacbw> you should tell them you'll do it and then hire someone in india who will do it for half the price and pocket the difference
18:36 < holzp> think abot that when they have to re-write it in two years and your "biggest client" cant be a reference anymore
18:36 < context> what isaac said !
18:36 < holzp> i dont think node is in the general deployment space just yet
18:36 < holzp> and certianly not for a "web pages mostly" web environment
18:36 < isaacbw> yea, node is probably best kept out of freelance projects unless they explicitly ask for it
18:36 < isaacbw> tbh
18:37 < isaacbw> wait no
18:37 < isaacbw> I'm retarded don't listen to that
18:37 < isaacbw> use node for everything
18:37 < isaacbw> gaaaaaaaahhhhhh
18:37 < isaacbw> caffeine
18:37 < mscdex> node.js rules!
18:37 < holzp> im gonna re-program my car to drive async
18:37 < isaacbw> you could think of it another way: if you use node.js and they can't find any other developers to maintain it, they'll have to keep coming back to you
18:37 < isaacbw> in fact, don't document any of your code
18:38 < Jhsto> lol
18:38 < isaacbw> ooh, improperly document your code to make any future developers look bad
18:38 < context> why do i get this feeling isaac is one of those people that sites like thedailywtf.com exist :p
18:38 < Orbitrix> @holzp my problem with async is that it does not seem to adhear to the CommonJS Promises specification
18:38 < isaacbw> but make the documents *really* nice, so they look legit
18:39 < context> err... one of those people that makes sites like dailywtf to exist
18:39 < isaacbw> dailywtf is all visual basic and java
18:39 < isaacbw> I wouldn't stoop so low
18:41 < isaacbw> I actually write really clean code
18:41 < isaacbw> I get kind of anal about it
18:41 < context> isaacbw: ;)
18:41 < isaacbw> I *have* been skimping on comments lately though
18:42 < holzp> Orbitrix, are you dead set for using promises?
18:42 < holzp> async's callback structure works very well with the redis libraries
18:42 < isaacbw> cocofffeeeeee
18:42 < isaacbw> this mug is the size of three normal mugs
18:43 < holzp> Jhsto, if they will need to call you just to add another web page then node may not be the best choice
18:43 < Orbitrix> holzp no i guess not... I'd just like my code to be somewhat standardized.   Asynchronous flow controls seems like a pretty important general concept in NodeJS, so it seems silly to use something that isnt a bit more standardized
18:44 < Orbitrix> i understand the virtues of having these types of things in userland, but the fragmentation seems rediculous
18:44 < isaacbw> you can do whatever you want as long as you like it
18:44 < holzp> except isnt node's own structure callback(err,result) ? 
18:44 < holzp> that seems to be the standard
18:44 < Orbitrix> well yea... but that leads to callback hell when you have multiple calls with more than a few results that rely on eachother
18:44 < holzp> hence why async and redis both use it
18:45 < Orbitrix> should i just be writing my callback functions out of the nest?
18:45 < holzp> thats why you use async :)
18:45 < Jhsto> holzp, I think I'll listen to the guy with a coffee cup and go with Wordpress.
18:45 < holzp> you can but I use async to streamline the code to keep out of callback hell
18:45 < Jhsto> I still would feel greedy to charge over 100€ though.
18:45 < holzp> Jhsto, or drupal or whatever
18:45 < Orbitrix> as long as async can pass values onto the next function in the execution chain
18:46 < phun-ky> my coffee's cold.. i was holding it warm for so long, cuz when it got cold, i was supposed to go to the gym. not tempting atm..
18:46 < holzp> ah Orbitrix thats its bag baby
18:46 < holzp> and with redit, it can pass along the redis callback as the next callback its sweet
18:47 < Orbitrix> ah ok
18:47 < Orbitrix> that does sound sweet
18:47 < holzp> hang on im looking for an example
18:48 < Jhsto> I dont get it. If you all think that node is not enterprise or common use ready, what do you do with it?
18:48 < Jhsto> Wait for it to become one?
18:49 < Orbitrix> wait for v1.0 :P
18:49 < Orbitrix> then you can sleep knowing major language features wont disappear
18:49 < Orbitrix> like promises.....
18:50 < holzp> Orbitrix, https://gist.github.com/bc127efda253b65727e8
18:50 < Orbitrix> thank you soooooooo much
18:50 < Orbitrix> googling examples has been a nightmare
18:50 < urbann> hi all,  is it a reason not to use node fd to write directly to html files?
18:50 < holzp> see how you can pass the next callback to the redis lib itself, very nice
18:51 < Orbitrix> that is slick
18:51 < holzp> Jhsto, its not about node's own "eerpriseness" but really what your client would need
18:51 < holzp> node is great because I know how to use it
18:51 < holzp> but for a client that just wants to make webpages they are needing a cms
18:51 < urbann> have google this subject but don't get any relevant hits.
18:51 < holzp> and thats not really here yet for node
18:51 < holzp> not like drupal or wordpress
18:52 < holzp> and the powerful stuff node give you (async, speed) they wont take advantage of
18:52 < holzp> so its a great tool and ready to go but not for everything
18:52 < holzp> yeah Orbitrix I did the same thing a few months ago and had to piece a lot of it tog myself
18:53 < Jhsto> I thought to make a CMS in node
18:53 < Jhsto> So I would get a project for myself and get paid for it too.
18:53 < Jhsto> Like for the school thingy
18:53 < Jhsto> Nothing too fancy though
18:54 < urbann> Jhsto: my question is related to a CMS kind of system
18:54 < AAA_awright> Orbitrix: By definition, major features may dissappear on any major revision number
18:54 < Jhsto> Although I know that the most of nodes features could not be used in that usecase
18:54 < holzp> why not concentrate on the html/css and let an existing *well proven* cms do the cmssing
18:55 < Orbitrix> i supose thats true, but i feel like once we're in v1.0 land theres going to be more effort to be a lot less of a 'beta' language
18:55 < Orbitrix> and so major changes will be a bigger deal
18:55 < holzp> its fun now, but thinkg about all the stuff they are going to tant you to add over years that is already in a common cms
18:56 < Jhsto> Because I feel like installing wordpress on lamp server and picking up a theme from themeforest seems too easy.
18:56 < holzp> will they be happy they need to keep paying you for stuff other people have for free
18:56 < urbann> holzp: I am a quite developer, I know I can load html from the database or from memory
18:56 < Jhsto> Like, is it even legal to charge for such?
18:56 < holzp> making things easy is a chargable skill
18:57 < Jhsto> Thats a nice viewpoint
18:57 < holzp> well it took years to learn
18:57 < urbann> but if I can write directly to html in my user scenario it means less overhead
18:58 < holzp> urbann, we havnt been talking about your thing 
18:58 < holzp> you are picking up a different conversation
18:58 < holzp> you are trying to write html files directly?
18:58 < k_89> now the ongoing convo begs me to question ... what do people here use node for ? (i know socket.io is a big thingy)
18:58 < k_89> but what else
18:58 < k_89> ?
18:59 < holzp> apis for the web
18:59 < k_89> flying robots using js ?
18:59 < holzp> restful stuff
18:59 < richcollins> How do I know when the write side of a pipe is finished?
18:59 < k_89> holzp: but isn't that as easily done in any other lang ?
18:59 < richcollins> outStream.on('end', ...) doesn't seem to work
18:59 < Jhsto> I made a CSRF protection using websockets
18:59 < urbann> holzp:  sorry!
18:59 < holzp> as of right now node does it faster and cleaner and pure js
18:59 < k_89> Jhsto: really !!! thats cool
18:59 < holzp> all of which are big ++
19:00 < k_89> hmm
19:00 < holzp> urbann,  what are you trying to do exactly?
19:00 < Jhsto> Lol its way too unpractical to be used in real world
19:00 < shihan> one thing that appeals to me with node is that it is very well self contained...
19:00 < k_89> richcollins: can i ask what are you working on ?
19:00 < AAA_awright> Orbitrix: I don't think there should be any reason to hold back on breakage. If there's a desirable function that breaks reverse-compatability, just release it, and increment the major version number while doing so.
19:00 < richcollins> k_89: I'm streaming an http response to a file
19:00 < shihan> i.e. you can download a relatively small binary and go to town... unlike almost any other language
19:01 < k_89> richcollins: k, cool
19:01 < holzp> javascript is becoming a defacto language choice for a lot now
19:01 < Jhsto> Holzp, do you do this for living?
19:01 < holzp> because client web is so important now
19:01 < holzp> yeah
19:01 < k_89> shihan: nope not true, you need a decent amount of npm packages to have a good workflow
19:02 < k_89> and npm, at present, is a mess, too many packages, and the good ones need to be googled out
19:02 < Jhsto> Is there any demand for your kind of people then?
19:02 < shihan> k_89, granted, but those are jsut an "npm install" away... you dont get that with anything else
19:02 < Jhsto> Like I havent met a single person irl who would have coded in node
19:02 < holzp> nerdy neckbeards? not from the ladies!
19:02 < urbann> holzp: I have a rails app that serves around 100 different websites, I want users to be able to login and change the design on there pages html/css
19:02 < k_89> shihan: again not true. I find managing packages via package.json a better idea, ruby has bundler, and php has composer
19:03 < k_89> python has pip and venv
19:03 < holzp> part of making a living is staying ahead of the curve and im betting on node
19:03 < holzp> urbann, ok...
19:03 < urbann> holzp: to be able to write directly to the individual templates should be a very clean solution
19:03 < holzp> hwhy use node then? why not implement in rails?
19:03 < shihan> k_89, i dont get how you mean that can be not true, even if you using package.json, your still "npm install'ing", but try do something similar to that with perl, python, etc etc... just to get the base binaries going, your in for a reasonable amount of compilation
19:03 < holzp> unless the markup is borked, then your templates are blown up
19:04 < holzp> do you really want to give your users unfettered access like that?
19:04 < richcollins> Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong in this pipe example?
19:04 < richcollins> http://cl.ly/text/163T0n0o1338
19:04 < holzp> users are really untrustworthy
19:04 < k_89> shihan: well, i dont know about base binaries, but all the other 3 web dev biggies .. python, ruby, and php have pretty good package managers
19:05 < holzp> Jhsto, not knowing a single person who does something may be bthe best reason to do it!
19:05 < urbann> holzp: I want users to be able to edit the pages "live" and then they like the result save the changes/write to html
19:05 < k_89> oh i get it now, you mean like the mysql driver of node .. which is written in js
19:05 < k_89> shihan: ^^ right ?
19:05 < shihan> k_89, granted, they are better at the "npm install" functionaliy then node...
19:05 < holzp> then thats prob ok, but i'd find a way to be able to rollback
19:06 < shihan> k_89, but still, if you want a new version of ruby, php, python, its not a simple thing
19:06 < holzp> like add a little .git repository per user
19:06 < urbann> holzp: Want a node app just to do that
19:06 < holzp> why not do it in rails if the app is already in rails?
19:06 < holzp> why split the implementation?
19:06 < shihan> k_89, though my interest stems from a more appliance-oriented feature set where that is a real strength
19:06 < k_89> not if you are on a debian distro
19:07 < k_89> shihan: can you elaborate on that last point ?
19:07 < k_89> (i am just curious about how people are using node, not trying to bash node in any way)
19:07 < shihan> k_89, depends on what you want and why you want it, on a debian distro you're still going to have to find a repo that has what your looking for, and there arent many guarentees of that
19:08 < k_89> dotdeb
19:08 < k_89> ftw
19:08 < dminus> well with ruby and perl there's rvm/perlbrew
19:08 < k_89> dotdeb.org
19:08 < shihan> k_89, well consider a firewall for example... extremely minimal OS, node slips in very easily... compiling php/ruby /python in that scenario is quite a pain
19:09 < k_89> yeah ..
19:09 < shihan> k_89, yeah, well away of dotdeb
19:09 < shihan> k_89, s/away/aware
19:09 < urbann> holzp: all the updating must be done in javascript and it is a quite powerful editor with a database backend
19:10 < urbann> holzp: difficult to explain but it is a web site builder tool
19:11 < shihan> k_89, but, i do currently have an lxc os that has only 2 binaries (ip and node), everything else comes from node and npm
19:11 < k_89> thats cool
19:11 < urbann> anyway that is irrelevant I just wonder if it is any drawbacks to write directly to html files?
19:12 < shihan> k_89, i've tried to do similar with ruby and php before, but you ultimately end up in a place where you just go "screw it, i'll just use the ubuntu/fedora lxc template" and install an entire os
19:13 < shihan> k_89, but as i was saying, thats what attracts *ME* to node, but it isnt exactly run-of-the-mill type stuff
19:13 < k_89> heh , yeah .. i was writing something similar
19:14 < k_89> a valid use case , but also at the same time , not a 'mainstream' one
19:15 < urbann> I really tried hard to find an answer on this question, I can't find any information on google and I do not know of any implementations 
19:15 < shihan> k_89, im hoping my lxc template might change that a bit :D
19:15 < urbann> is it a reason why we always write to databases?
19:16 < urbann> or just old habit?
19:16 < holzp> no drawbacks
19:16 < holzp> i think any real drawbacks come from the implrmentation
19:16 < holzp> like if the html is bad and overwrites good and the good is gone forever
19:16 < k_89> urbann: concurrency
19:16 < holzp> seriously think about some sort of version control
19:17 < k_89> imagine 2 different connections trying to edit the same file at the same time
19:17 < holzp> thats notsomuch a storage thing but a app thing
19:17 < holzp> there is a narrower problem of concurrancy in the saving
19:17 < k_89> holzp: make an api for git
19:18 < k_89> !!
19:18 < holzp> but the problem you have would be two users editing the same file at the same time, regardless of storage
19:18 < k_89> manage the html of users via git, at filesystem level
19:18 < holzp> well yeah shy not just via the command line
19:18 < holzp> why does it need a big sooper-doopery api
19:19 < k_89> holzp: aren't you allowing your clients to mess with files via their browsers ?
19:20 < holzp> well you would have to assume some protections would be built in to the app
19:20 < holzp> but storing data on a filesystem is not a horrible choice
19:20 < urbann> k_89: yes the owners of the sites should be able to change the design of there own sites
19:21 < k_89> urbann: holzp: then just expose a simple api for git to them, so they can save "versions" of their site :P
19:21 < holzp> i wasnt even thinking "for them"
19:22 < holzp> just something the app could use for internal version control of their files
19:22 < holzp> just manage git as a child process as needed
19:23 < holzp> just a cheap fast way to add some sort of rollback for each users files
19:23 < urbann> k_89: yes I was thinking something like that, still I find it strange I can't find any other implementations of this
19:24 < k_89> urbann: me too :P
19:24 < k_89> cool idea though, a cms with version management
19:24 < k_89> using git :P
19:24 < k_89> dumb corporate it deps would be very pleased 
19:24 < holzp> whynot, its cheap to use and the clients never have to know
19:24 < k_89> :s/it/IT
19:25 < dminus> heh
19:25 < holzp> i use local git control everywhere
19:25 < dminus> there are systems that already do that
19:25 < k_89> really ?
19:25 < dminus> hostgator quickinstall
19:25 < k_89> well, any php ones?
19:25 < dminus> does backups with git
19:25 < k_89> oh
19:25 < k_89> not back up
19:25 < k_89> full on management
19:25 < k_89> hmm
19:25 < dminus> its not part of the applications but
19:25 < dminus> beats a poke in the eye
19:26 < urbann> in general should not a simple CMS without any database that only write to the html file and git be a good simple solution?
19:26 < rudiX> how to replace contents from fs.readFile( ... the basic .replace() function only replaces first string
19:26 < holzp> its a simple solution, how good it is will be up to you
19:26 < isaacbw> it's not much of a cms then is it urbann 
19:26 < k_89> yeah ^^
19:26 < urbann> why are we using databases for all simple tasks?
19:26 < k_89> but
19:27 < k_89> a great solution for small sites
19:27 < isaacbw> because databases are fuuuuuuun
19:27 < holzp> you can always add overkill later
19:27 < k_89> urbann: relations
19:27 < k_89> those are one big reason i prefer sql dbs to nosql ones
19:27 < k_89> and concurrency
19:27 < isaacbw> I just met the most adorable japanese woman
19:27 < holzp> i need to search a file for a string on my unix box, i think im doing to do it with node, redis and memcached
19:27 < urbann> k_89: relations , yes true
19:27 < CoverSlide> but mongodb is web scale
19:28 < isaacbw> she realized she was wearing shoes indoors and freaked out
19:28 < isaacbw> and was like 'sorry sorry sorry'
19:28 < isaacbw> and took her shoes off
19:28 < urbann> CoverSlide:  mongodb is my other option but why the overhead?
19:28 < k_89> urbann: also concurrency, two different processes trying to write to the same file at the same time would fuck things up
19:28 < CoverSlide> you should order her to commit seppuku
19:28 < isaacbw> mongodb is sexy
19:28 < k_89> eh
19:28 < isaacbw> shit dude
19:28 < isaacbw> that's dark
19:28 < holzp> yeah, but in practice very slim chance that stuff happens
19:28 < rudiX> couchdb - sexier :)
19:29 < holzp> esp for just 100 sites
19:29 < AAA_awright> rudiX: Use a regex and specify the g flag, e.g. "strings".replace(/s/g, '')
19:29 < urbann> k_89: Is it not the same problem with a database?
19:29 < isaacbw> no way
19:29 < isaacbw> 10gen has leaf-shaped usb sticks with mingo distributions on them
19:29 < holzp> databases auto avoid that
19:29 < isaacbw> I bet apache doesn't have that
19:29 < k_89> urbann: i don't think so
19:29 < k_89> its not
19:29 < holzp> atomic commits
19:29 < k_89> actually
19:29 < CoverSlide> i wouldn't say couch is sexier
19:29 < k_89> acid thingy
19:30 < holzp> but thats no reason to just use a db, just be aware of the case when writing your save()
19:30 < rudiX> CoverSlide: y not ... its lightweight and its very related to JS
19:30 < shihan> personally, i dont think a db really solves concurrency issues
19:30 < isaacbw> you don't really need atomic commits with document based storage though
19:30 < k_89> shihan: eh !! it does
19:30 < CoverSlide> mongo has atomic commits, with couch i don't know how would one do that, using a PUT would be racy
19:31 < isaacbw> it has atomic commits within the document
19:31 < CoverSlide> does it?
19:31 < isaacbw> but across documents it doesn't
19:31 < k_89> afaik, mongo doesn't have transactions
19:31 < CoverSlide> i dunno, haven't used couch
19:31 < shihan> why? i mean theres nothing to stop two people who are editing a page from hitting "save" at roughly the same time... person who hits it last wins really
19:31 < holzp> your bigger problem would be two users editing the same document at the same time, not so much saving both instances at the same time
19:31 < isaacbw> but if you really need that you're doing it wrong
19:31 < isaacbw> k_89, that's right
19:32 < k_89> and transactions are *important* in any complex business logic
19:32 < isaacbw> that's not really the database's business thuogh holzp
19:32 < isaacbw> that's more of an application thing
19:32 < isaacbw> k_89, only if you have related data split among tables
19:32 < isaacbw> the idea behind mongo (and couch I assume) is to have that all in one document
19:32 < isaacbw> so conceptually you wouldn't need transactions
19:33 < k_89> shihan: its more about calling fopen on a file already streamed .. man its been so long since i dealt with this stuff, i need to brush my basics again :p
19:33 < holzp> isaacbw, no its the apps problem
19:33 < isaacbw> and if you really need to emulate them, you can on in application logic
19:33 < urbann> holzp: In my user scenario it is very few writes, maybe one a week!
19:33 < holzp> which is why it exists regardless of selected storage
19:33 < holzp> right
19:33 < shihan> k_89, but you face the same problem on the FS as you do in the DB, even exactly the same locking semantics
19:33 < holzp> its prob not even a problem for you
19:33 < CoverSlide> mongodb is web scale, it has sharding, you just plug it in and it scales right up
19:33 < isaacbw> but mongo isn't an end-all solution. If you really really need transactions, then choose mysql
19:33 < k_89> shihan: let me do a quick check
19:34 < isaacbw> that's the point of having options, is being able to choose based on what you need
19:34 < holzp> you may not even have to worry about it, just if somethign wierd happens keep in in your head as a "well this may have happened"
19:34 < rudiX> i didnt tried but there is pretty much useful info about couchdb and socket.io .... so transactions pffff
19:35 < isaacbw> mongo and couch fill slightly different roles
19:35 < urbann> It is not a problem to have a file open and read the same file at the same time?
19:35 < isaacbw> just read up on them
19:35 < shihan> one thing a database is good at is being a single central point (even if its clustered, replicating, etc)
19:35 < isaacbw> and decide which one you like best
19:35 < CoverSlide> databases are good at being bases ... for data
19:36 < holzp> well, i wouldnt leave your files hanging open
19:36 < urbann> isaacbw: I use mongo but just write to html seems so simple in my case
19:36 < isaacbw> probably
19:36 < holzp> start simple, let the use cases force you to move to more complex solutions
19:37 < rudiX> I am just curious how much data in gb's you guys work with ... 
19:37 < isaacbw> actually, I have no idea what this conversation is about
19:37 < shihan> i think the point is, is that no matter what you use, fs, db, or other, ultimately its up to the app to structure and control its data
19:37 < holzp> yeah db's give you more tools to do but at the cost of complexity
19:37 < holzp> start simple!
19:38 < urbann> lets say you have a webpage with lets say 15 visitors, then the admin of the page decides to update the page. is this a problem
19:38 < rudiX> starting always is simple ... unless you data mining
19:38 < shihan> thats entirely up to how your page is working
19:38 < niix> CoverSlide: haha quote of the day 'databases are good at being bases ... for data'
19:38 < rudiX> hahaha
19:38 < holzp> you should be fine, really
19:39 < shihan> on a unix world, at the most absolutely layer, it wont matter cause if the file is updated WHILE the webserver is reading it, it'll continue to read the old file
19:39 < holzp> we arent talking Amazon here
19:42 < urbann> I do not have a problem with the high level implementation but do not really know whats going on then you read,write, open,close files in a lower level
19:42 < urbann> shihan: yes, stupid of me
19:43 < urbann> holzp: you should be fine, really  -- I hope so : )  thanks a lot for your help
19:43 < isaacbw> I need to listen to someone talk while I work
19:43 < urbann> thanks everybody
19:44 < isaacbw> does anyone have podcast suggestions?
19:44 < isaacbw> not necessarily development related
19:44 < isaacbw> but must have a nice voice
19:44 < shihan> heh, about the only pod casts i listen to are "learn a new language ones", and i fail at all those
19:44 < isaacbw> I've given up at learning languages
19:45 < ksmth> hey guys
19:45 < ksmth> is there any capistrano alternative for node yet?
19:45 < isaacbw> make one
19:46 < CoverSlide> i used to listen to adam carolla
19:46 < ksmth> erm - I won't make one if there is one ;)
19:46 < holzp> bill burr's monday morning podcast
19:46 < CoverSlide> probably the only non-tech podcast i would listen to regularly
19:47 < isaacbw> cool, thanks
19:47 < isaacbw> is he an annoying douchebag?
19:47 < CoverSlide> for web development, there's shop talk, big web show, web ahead
19:47 < CoverSlide> for js stuff, there's javascript jabber
19:48 < CoverSlide> oh bill burr hmm i might listen to that
19:49 < shihan> you could always write a quick script in linux that grabs a random man page and pipes it into epeak or some other tts engine... gee that'd get annoying
19:49 < shihan> s/epeak/espeak
19:49 < CoverSlide> haha
19:50 < CoverSlide> there was an android ebook reader that had tts, aReader i think it was called, i tried loading some tech book into it so i would have something to listen to on the way to work
19:50 < CoverSlide> hard to grasp the concepts when you're not looking at the code though
19:51 < CoverSlide> and tts voices are hard to listen to for more that 5 seconds at a time
19:51 < shihan> aint that true :)
19:52 < ksmth> has anyone here ever used "d"? https://github.com/hij1nx/d
19:52 < CoverSlide> only whil ehigh on e
19:52 < CoverSlide> while smoking a j
19:52 < niix> :D
19:52 < sohcahtoa> where d is a dick
19:52  * sohcahtoa ducks
19:54 < dminus> catdrugs
19:54 <@TooTallNate> o.O
19:57 < cloudbender> ok ... let the fun begin
19:57 < dminus> fun started hours ago
19:58 < cloudbender> Temp this morning ... -32C ... geez
20:00 < CoverSlide> temp this morning ... 71F ... :D
20:01 < cloudbender> ok you win
20:02 < cloudbender> I watched RD's video, 'Intro to Node.js'
20:02 < cloudbender> It is a bit dated, no problem.
20:03 < cloudbender> He states Node can be backed by the v8 engine in chrome
20:03 < CoverSlide> it is very dated, although the http api has remained constant this whole time
20:03 < CoverSlide> at least that portion i think
20:04 < shihan> temp 3 days ago: 45c, temp 2 days ago 17c....
20:04 < CoverSlide> it is backed by the v8 engine. it can't be backed by any other engine at the moment
20:04 < cloudbender> shihan 45c is hot. wow.
20:04 < CoverSlide> holy shit
20:05 < CoverSlide> where are you? aus?
20:05 < cloudbender> <<< Canada
20:05 < shihan> yeah, in sydney
20:05 < shihan> apparently it was our hottest day on record... certainly felt pretty horrific
20:06 < cloudbender> So, If node is backed by V8 (in chrome), how to I get v8 onto my server then ?
20:06 < cloudbender> Does it install with node ?
20:06 < CoverSlide> v8 installs within node
20:06 < cloudbender> copy
20:06 < cloudbender> ok
20:07 < CoverSlide> v8 is designed to be embeddable
20:07 < cloudbender> copy
20:08 < cloudbender> Is it ok to say the 'M' word ? It pertains, I promise lol
20:09 < cloudbender> Or, can I post a link ?
20:09 < isaacbw> m word
20:09 < CoverSlide> Manitoba?
20:09 < isaacbw> meringue?
20:10 < CoverSlide> Mexicans?
20:10 < isaacbw> damn mexicans
20:10 < cloudbender> lol no, here ...
20:10 < cloudbender> http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/nodejs/
20:10 < cloudbender> I guess it's actually the 'W' word
20:10 < isaacbw> microsoft
20:11 < CoverSlide> ok
20:11 < shihan> lol, i was trying to think what the m word actually was then
20:11 < isaacbw> if you want to punish yourself, go ahead
20:11 < cloudbender> Well, that's the thing
20:11 < cloudbender> My self mutilation days are behind me
20:11 < isaacbw> you have a few fellow masochists on this channel I think
20:11 < cloudbender> lol
20:11 < CoverSlide> node on windows isn't quite as bad as anything-else-except-maybe-java on windows
20:12 < C0deMaver1ck> I've been building a fairly sophisticated app on windows
20:12 < C0deMaver1ck> socket.io, redis, and a few other things
20:12 < C0deMaver1ck> it's actually been ok
20:13 < isaacbw> it helps that you have npm and don't have to rely on system repositories for packages
20:13 < CoverSlide> as long as you stay in js-land, you should be fine on windows
20:13 < cloudbender> Well, with MS and SUN trying to 'embrace and extend' each other for so long, I keep thinking, 'eeeuw'
20:13 < isaacbw> trying to do c development on windows is true torture
20:13 < C0deMaver1ck> CoverSlide: I've had to compile a few native extensions with VS but that wasn't hard at all
20:13 < cloudbender> Yes JS that's my thoughts also.
20:13 < cloudbender> brb doorbell
20:13 < CoverSlide> yeah, that part's actually possible thanks to node-gyp
20:14 < CoverSlide> i just wish they supported mingw
20:14 < C0deMaver1ck> yeah it's pretty nice, all I had to do was install python 2.x and VS and node-gyp worked great
20:14 < C0deMaver1ck> equivalent to installing developer tools on OS X, except OS X comes with python
20:15 < CoverSlide> well how big is it? you can get the command-line only stuff for OSX in 300M
20:15 < CoverSlide> although for most things you need the full 4G of XCode
20:15 < C0deMaver1ck> probably a good few gigs, same as xcode I'd assume
20:15 < CoverSlide> i can't remember if you can compile node without xcode or not
20:15 < C0deMaver1ck> I work on OS X at work, unix and windows at home
20:15 < rickibalboa> Will node throw any sort of error if I try to "delete" a property that is already undefined? Or will it just carry on
20:16 < CoverSlide> delete doesn't throw
20:16 < C0deMaver1ck> probably carry on
20:16 < rickibalboa> Okay. I figured so thanks
20:16 < polotek> rickibalboa: delete is a javascript concept. has nothing to do with node
20:16 < CoverSlide> >> var a = {};console.log(delete a.b)
20:16 < purr> CoverSlide: undefined; Console: true
20:16 < CoverSlide> delete is kind of shitty too, very few actual uses for it
20:17 < isaacbw> v8 has too good a garbage collector
20:17 < rickibalboa> mm I suppose.
20:17 < polotek> There's only one use for it. and it works great for that
20:17 < isaacbw> the preferred method is to set it to null
20:17 < shihan> out of curiosity, since i've not tried node on windows, can u use the / as a path seperator (or do you have to stick with path.sep)?
20:17 < polotek> deleting properties off of objects
20:17 < isaacbw> yea
20:17 < CoverSlide> plus i hear it gets in the way of v8's optimizations and actually slows down code
20:17 < rickibalboa> Yea thats what I'm using it for :P
20:17 < isaacbw> wait I'm retarded
20:17 < C0deMaver1ck> shihan: / works just fine
20:18 < CoverSlide> setting to null is simpler, and possibly faster
20:18 < isaacbw> do any of you guys use angular
20:18 < shihan> C0deMaver1ck, kewl, where does \ come into the equation? like if your using a method that returns a file path, do they generally return / or \?
20:18 < isaacbw> wtf is going onnnnn
20:18 < C0deMaver1ck> shihan: /, always use unix style paths
20:18 < CoverSlide> i been meaning to try angular, when i've absolutely nothing better to do
20:19 < cloudbender> shihan I thought you could strobe the environment for the path sep. and line-term. values ?
20:19 < C0deMaver1ck> shihan: I'm not completely positive, but I'm fairly certain it will always return a unix style path
20:19 < shihan> oh good, i was dreading the idea of porting code of one app cause it does a fair amount of regex on file paths and if i had to make it all work with \ and /, that would be sooooo painful
20:19 < isaacbw> CoverSlide, it will change your life
20:19 < isaacbw> for serious
20:20 < CoverSlide> in what way?
20:20 < polotek> CoverSlide: setting to null is fine. But depends on usage. If you enumerate, you'll still get those
20:20 < polotek> if you do "prop" in obj, you'll still true
20:20 < isaacbw> CoverSlide, you haven't developed client-side interfaces until you've done it with Angular
20:20 < CoverSlide> yeah, i know the keys still get enumerated
20:20 < shihan> cloudbender, well the path seperator can be gotten from path.sep... i was just hoping it uses / internally
20:20 < isaacbw> SERVERSIDE RENDERING IS A THING OF THE PAST MY BROTHERS
20:21 < isaacbw> JOIN ME IN THE CULT OF ANGULAR
20:21 < polotek> CoverSlide: I know that you know. I'm trying to suggest not making things so black and white
20:21 < polotek> especially to people who are trying to learn
20:21 < cloudbender> ok.  so, trying to think about the 'cloud', and who's cloud to go with.
20:21 < ipc9> i want to contribute to node.js and i have read the contribute doc on github.  what bug/feature request would be the best use of my time?
20:21 < shihan> lol, personal opinion, but you'd have to define cloud first ;)
20:22 < isaacbw> ipc9 whatever you have the skills to do
20:22 < cloudbender> I know, it's a bit of a buzz-word.
20:22 < CoverSlide> cloudbender: you want paas or iaas?
20:22 < isaacbw> idea as a service?
20:22 < CoverSlide> infrastructure
20:22 < polotek> cloudbender: use nodejitsu unless there's a compelling reason not to
20:22 < cloudbender> I want a small-to-mid sized co-location
20:22 < cloudbender> or a vm
20:23 < cloudbender> depending on the company
20:23 < isaacbw> I think idea as a service sounds better
20:23 < isaacbw> why not go middle ground and just get a dedicated server
20:23 < isaacbw> do you live somewhere with cheap colocation?
20:23 < isaacbw> I wanted to do colocation, but it costs twice as much here as anywhere else
20:24 < isaacbw> fuck that
20:24 < cloudbender> For co-location I was thinking hurricane electric
20:24 < cloudbender> for VM I was thinking AT&T
20:24 < CoverSlide> AT&T has a cloud service?
20:25 < st_luke> it's called twilio
20:26 < cloudbender> AT&T Has virtual Machine Hosting
20:26 < isaacbw> what
20:26 < isaacbw> lol
20:26 < CoverSlide> interesting
20:26 < isaacbw> at&t owns twilio?
20:27 < cloudbender> The point is, I can afford about $100 per month for a solid back-end.
20:27 < CoverSlide> have you looked into joyent?
20:27 < cloudbender> Then I need a year to perfect an app, a private app, about 20 users.
20:27 < CoverSlide> if you want to do node
20:27 < cloudbender> No I did not look into joyent but I will for sure.
20:28 < cloudbender> Again, the 'A' word ....
20:29 < CoverSlide> there's an 'A' word now?
20:29 < isaacbw> amarzarn
20:29 < cloudbender> Azure
20:29 < isaacbw> oh
20:29 < CoverSlide> do they do VM hosting? I thought they only did app hosting
20:29 < CoverSlide> although i hear their prices are a bit more reasonable
20:30 < cloudbender> Thier prices, as always, seem ok-ish, it's the terms that sux.
20:31 < cloudbender> I'm not sure I want to be invlolved with all of that.
20:31 < isaacbw> with what
20:32 < CoverSlide> i think most of the providers have a free tier or free period
20:32 < cloudbender> With the licensing stratification in azure
20:32 < shihan> azure has a reasonably impressive cds available to it pretty easily too
20:32 < isaacbw> rackspace has been friendly to me, though their prices aren't the best
20:32 < CoverSlide> maybe try them all out
20:33 < shihan> s/cds/sdn
20:33 < shihan> s/cds/cdn geezus
20:33 < isaacbw> guise
20:33 < isaacbw> guise
20:33 < isaacbw> would you be into the idea of a forum for web developers
20:34 < isaacbw> this would be a perfect thing for a thread
20:34 < rideh> cheap node host?
20:34 < CoverSlide> i think he wants vm hosting
20:34 < cloudbender> Now ... Mozilla is talking of a new OS.  Would this OS also be embeddable under node ?
20:35 < isaacbw> waht
20:35 < CoverSlide> embed the OS into node? or embed node into the OS?
20:35 < cloudbender> I need a vm in an iron-mountain datacenter that does not cost me a fortune
20:35 < rideh> can non vps hosts handle stuff like hosting elastic search side by side with a node app?
20:35 < CoverSlide> webos for example bundles node as an executable
20:35 < cloudbender> ok
20:36 < cloudbender> dang doorbell again gawwwd
20:36 < isaacbw> smak dat fool
20:36 < shihan> i've heard good things about linode if all your after is a linux vm
20:37 < rideh> i'm running linode for about a dozen projects right now, i like it but this will be my first deployed node app so i'm trying to figure out whats best for it. Get another linode for node stuff or use a node host
20:37 < CoverSlide> linode is pretty affordable for a single linux vm
20:37 < rideh> from what im seeing - wont really find anything much cheaper than linode. heroku is significantly more expensive.
20:38 < shihan> yeah, linode seem cheap but well done... theres alot of vm hosts out there that really are cheap...
20:38 < Iszak_> Is it possible with npm to see what new updates there are without installing them? kind of like a dry run.
20:38 < rideh> if you do linode use my code :) http://www.linode.com/?r=ef9c0459c1d2c8e1873488781c152344a3b2ab04
20:38 < s5fs> linode is cheap, i'm connected thru them right now. overall it's solid, but just a few minutes ago i was dropping a lot of packets. i tend to get network performance issues on occasion.
20:39 < Iszak_> WHAT
20:39 < rideh> s5fs might be the node you are on - i'd ask around on #linode
20:39 < Iszak_> Linode is NOT cheap, solid but not cheap.
20:39 < CoverSlide> linode is what $20 / mo
20:39 < C0deMaver1ck> I'd recommend ramnode.com
20:39 < Iszak_> CoverSlide expensive.
20:40 < rideh> iszak who do you recommend
20:40 < Iszak_> the HDD and BW isn't enough
20:40 < rideh> that isn't a fly by night
20:40 < Iszak_> Well it depends if you need to scale.
20:40 < shihan> there certainly are a number of vps providers out there that are quite a bit cheaper then linode, but they do come and go a bit :)
20:40 < Iszak_> I've heard good things about Hetzner and Leaseweb
20:40 < rideh> i've never even heard of them
20:40 < C0deMaver1ck> I've been with ramnode for about a year, and they have an IRC channel. Some pretty cool folks
20:41 < rideh> anyone used these guys? http://prgmr.com/xen/
20:41 < C0deMaver1ck> yeah I've used them
20:42 < Iszak_> Isn't Xen a type of virtualization.
20:42 < Iszak_> vs OpenVZ etc.
20:42 < Iszak_> I recommend Xen, used OpenVZ too many shit hosts oversell
20:42 < s5fs> Iszak_: i'm connected to my tiny linode instance via ssh most of the day, almost every day. i'm a lot more sensitive to brief interruptions since it interrupts my typing.
20:43 < Iszak_> s5fs hmm? does linode have brief interruptions? 
20:43 < s5fs> Iszak_: right now i'm experiencing packet loss, traceroute shows a drop at he.net.
20:43 < st_luke> try mosh
20:43 < Iszak_> ouch
20:43 < st_luke> linode's support is pretty receptive to problems
20:43 < s5fs> Iszak_: hey,for $20 i'm not complaining. it's a great service overall.
20:44 < Iszak_> st_luke++ nice find
20:44 < Iszak_> s5fs oh yeah I agree, I just found their "extras" to be overpriced.
20:44 < Iszak_> I go through TB's of bandwidth a month
20:44 < cloudbender> I have many users of the (prospective) app who connect over flakey satellite links.  Stable, but a bit jittery, and then there is the weather.
20:44 < cloudbender> I'm logging this, you guys have great suggestions all.
20:44 < s5fs> Iszak_: yeah, i'm vanilla too, extras are overpriced. my bandwidth is low,the damn thing only hosts a few files and an irssi screen session
20:45 < Iszak_> s5fs you do all your devs there?
20:46 < st_luke> linode is one of the better vps providers for reliability and servers that aren't overloaded
20:46 < s5fs> Iszak_: nope, none at all
20:46 < rideh> iszak what are you hosting? i certainly dont have that type of traffic
20:46 < s5fs> we're using a mix of rackspace and aws for work stuffs, linode is my personal dorkaround box.
20:46 < Iszak_> rideh I can't tell you, sorry.
20:47 < rideh> whoever is on my node with me is getting a deal. sitting at 2% utilization typically :/
20:47 < Iszak_> rideh lots and lots of porn.
20:47 < rideh> Iszak_: gotcha
20:47 < cloudbender> I like that Linode allows 'any' distro
20:47 < Iszak_> st_luke I am going to try that shell out tomorrow on the way to work (I train in)
20:47 < rideh> mosh looks interesting
20:47 < cloudbender> ooooh train, sounds cool.
20:48 < st_luke> Iszak_: I use it a lot when traveling or even when at home. it's nice because I can close my laptop and open it up anywhere and reconnect to the server
20:48 < st_luke> resume everything, same shell, programs etc. it's like a magical screen session
20:49 < cloudbender> Has anyone else wrestled with windows 8 start screen ?
20:49 < cloudbender> Live Tiles ?
20:50 < Iszak_> cloudbender yeah I've found the best solution online is to install another distribution.
20:50 < cloudbender> in the vm you mean ?
20:50 < Iszak_> No.
20:50 < Iszak_> no one in their right might would subject themselves to the cognitive burden known as windows 8.
20:51 < Iszak_> s/might/mind/
20:51 < cloudbender> For those who don't know (care) ...
20:51 < Iszak_> Hey, what took 3 steps in Windows 7 is going to take 5 and a full submersive live tile experience in windows 8, improvement!
20:52 < cloudbender> The Live Tiles are streamed in (pushed) from the 'windows notification service' somewhere.
20:52 < Iszak_> I think windows 8 for tablet is good though.
20:52 < cloudbender> COuld be, don;t have a tablet.
20:52 < Iszak_> I think they've shot their desktop users in the foot by trying to bandage up the other foot to support tablet.
20:52 < cloudbender> It was a 'hail-mary' release, no doubt.
20:53 < Iszak_> cloudbender I suspect (and I hope) that when they release SP1 that they'll allow the ability to disable the tile interface and bring back the start menu.
20:54 < rideh> ^
20:54 < dan_> hi
20:54 < cloudbender> Tiles can be removed, notifications can be disabled in group policy.
20:54 < Iszak_> Can they? but the start menu?!
20:54 < cloudbender> Yes, the start screen has to go away.
20:54 < Iszak_> has to? or CAN?
20:54 < dan_> Would noje.js be appropriate for making a social network like twitter or facebook?
20:55 < Iszak_> dan_ well those SN don't use just one language/technology - so no.
20:55 < cloudbender> So many people hate the start screen, they have to do something.
20:55 < Iszak_> I mean, sure you could do it all in node.js but they probably won't.
20:55 < rideh> anyone else enjoy that #1 in performance and reliability video player on joyent's website crashes when you click play?
20:55 < cloudbender> But at this point there are no tweaks out there.
20:56 < shihan> theres a couple of free apps out there for switching back to a "classic" shell in win 8 if you so desire
20:56 < rideh> anyone have advice for me with my first node app going up - utilizes elastic search?
20:56 < Iszak_> shit you guys are a productivity waster! I'm meant to be productive at the moment.
20:56 < rideh> sorry, to be more specific: hosts that simply won't handle it, things i might bork easily?
20:57 < cloudbender> sorry !!! I'll be here for the long haul, so ignore me if you need :)
20:57 < holzp> lol, irc can give you hours, irc can take your hours
20:58 < cloudbender> PS avoid start8, a proposed replacement for the start screen.
20:58 < shihan> someone was showing me pokki the other day (start menu for win8), that didnt seem too bad
20:58 < cloudbender> it's buggered up.
20:58 < cloudbender> Well, If they can do it, I'll find a way to do it, but I digress ...
21:00 < cloudbender> I want to leave the world of native app dev and climb into the browser.  Node seems like a nice way to go.
21:01 < cloudbender> The problem now is choosing a platform for node.  You guys have some great thoughts.
21:01 < k_89> paltform ?
21:02 < CoverSlide> hosting platform
21:02 < k_89> vps + nginx ftw
21:02 < cloudbender> right, the backing stack so to speak
21:02 < k_89> backing stack ?
21:02 < cloudbender> server stack
21:03 < rideh> damn maybe i should just hook up a raspberry_pi to host my node app
21:03 < rideh> plug it into someone's network that has great bandwidth...
21:03 < k_89> eh, just install node on a vps, and put nginx in front of it
21:03 < shihan> lol, buy a 1ru case, rip the inards out, put in a switch and see how many r-pi's you can fit in it :D
21:03 < k_89> thats how everything is hosted :P
21:03 < CoverSlide> yes, but the question is which vps provider?
21:04 < k_89> hehe
21:04 < rideh> coverslide, you can share one ofmy raspberry pis
21:04 < rideh> gorilla hosting!
21:04 < rideh> i'm starting a company
21:04 < rideh> sorry, guerilla
21:04 < CoverSlide> and not true, there's lots of people running node on nodejitsu, azure,
21:04 < dminus> CoverSlide: linode, naturally
21:04 < k_89> bleh, dont like PaaS stuff
21:05 < CoverSlide> i think we've already dicussed this vps debate thing 20 minutes ago
21:05 < k_89> haha
21:05 < rideh> any experience with this: http://nodester.com/
21:05 < k_89> oh, i was somewhere else
21:05 < CoverSlide> nodester, they just got bought
21:05 < CoverSlide> can't remember who
21:06 < rideh> they say appfog or something
21:06 < CoverSlide> well not just it was a while ago
21:06 < cloudbender> I'm not in love with PaaS, SaaS, but It's here, it's now, it's wow ....
21:06 < shihan> i really wish calxeda had been more towards "lots of r-pi's in a box" then the completely over-engineered arm server farm that it is
21:06 < CoverSlide> Well PaaS can mean a difference in cost of about 4-5x
21:06 < cloudbender> Yes
21:07 < CoverSlide> and not to mention not having to pay a sysadmin or spend time worrying about sysadminny stuff
21:07 < dminus> it's good for the complexion
21:07 -!- mode/#Node.js [+o TooTallNate] by ChanServ
21:07 < rideh> hmm, i'm gonna cater to clients who dont mind significant downtime. their servers will run off of non conscenting networks discretely looking like air freshners on the outside.  gotta put in an order for a few dozen pis
21:08 < k_89> bleh, most of us can do sysadminny stuff for a long time anyways
21:08 < CoverSlide> also true
21:08 < RushPL> my node must have got updater from repository .. but I am getting such error:
21:08 < RushPL> node: symbol lookup error: node_modules/mongodb/node_modules/bson/build/Release/bson.node: undefined symbol: _ZN2v816FunctionTemplate3NewEPFNS_6HandleINS_5ValueEEERKNS_9ArgumentsEES3_NS1_INS_9SignatureEEE
21:08 < RushPL> any idea?
21:09 < CoverSlide> but i don't find that quite as fun as writing code
21:09 < blakmatrix> rideh: hell you can make it into an airfreshner and plug it directly into a wall lol
21:09 < rideh> blakmatrix: thats what im thinking yea.. 
21:09 < rideh> hahah
21:09 < cloudbender> <<<< loves the code, dreams the code, wishes he could marry the code and make code-babies.
21:10 < CoverSlide> RushPL: you should be using the native mongo & bson module. you should probably update mongodb and / or your version of node
21:10 < shihan> well, with some use of one of the neural net lib's in node, code-babies might be fundamentally possible
21:10 < CoverSlide> the compiled bson i think could lead to crap like that
21:10 < RushPL> how do you force uncompiled bson?
21:11 < CoverSlide> i think it's the default in never versions
21:11 < RushPL> my mongoose is the most recent
21:11 < CoverSlide> RushPL: what version of node are you running?
21:11 < RushPL> 0.8.12
21:12 < RushPL> I see 0.8.18 is the most recent
21:12 < RushPL> my repo must be not that recent after all
21:14 < CoverSlide> ok maybe i was wrong, it does try to build the native bson parser by default
21:14 < CoverSlide> that's shitty
21:15 < cloudbender> lol shihan
21:15 < cloudbender> <<< needs to get a coffee
21:16 < phun-ky> did anyone say coffee!?!
21:17 < euoia> I'm curious, is there a node roadmap somewhere?
21:17 < phun-ky> *run to the coffee machine*
21:17 < RushPL> CoverSlide:  any idea what would be the opposite of native here? "npm install mongodb --mongodb:native"
21:18 < verysoftoiletppr> Hi 
21:18 < verysoftoiletppr> I'm new to node
21:18 < verysoftoiletppr> I'm tyrin to import modules with require('moduleName')
21:19 < verysoftoiletppr> but I get Error: Cannot find module 'moduleName'
21:19 < isaacbw> well, is moduleName installed
21:19 < cloudbender> saw that coming ...
21:19 < isaacbw> http://nodejs.org/api/modules.html
21:20 < verysoftoiletppr> isaacbw yes, I installed it globally
21:21 < verysoftoiletppr> however if I install locally, it finds the module
21:21 < isaacbw> verysoftoiletppr, 1) you shouldn't really install a module globally if it's being used as a library
21:21 < isaacbw> global installation is mostly for command line operations
21:21 < verysoftoiletppr> isaacbw I see
21:22 < verysoftoiletppr> isaacbw so, only install globally it if it is supposed to be a cmd line command?
21:22 < isaacbw> pretty much
21:22 < isaacbw> http://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_loading_from_the_global_folders
21:23 < isaacbw> but there's how you would do it if you wanted to
21:23 < etcetera> is anyone coming from ruby to node? and why?
21:23 < CoverSlide> also https://npmjs.org/doc/faq.html#I-installed-something-globally-but-I-can-t-require-it
21:24 < verysoftoiletppr> etcetera because node is better
21:25 < isaacbw> it's easier to manage development when the frontend and backend use the same language
21:26 < etcetera> isaacbw: where does ruby do better than node?
21:26 < CoverSlide> javascript is lightweight, better performance over ruby in most cases, smaller standard library, easy to write event-driven stuff
21:26 < RushPL> CoverSlide: updating node didn't help at all :(
21:26 < CoverSlide> RushPL: ok, i don't know then
21:26 < etcetera> in terms of both developer experience, and performance?
21:26 < etcetera> specifics would be great.
21:26 < isaacbw> and preference
21:26 < isaacbw> why
21:27 < isaacbw> it's just a choice people make for various reasons
21:27 < etcetera> What are those various reasons?
21:27 < RushPL> I think in node you can actually understand what it's going on :-)
21:27 < isaacbw> if you're trying to get help making your own decision, you need to just spend time with both and decide
21:27 < CoverSlide> RushPL: report an issue on mongodb/js-bson or mongodb/node-mongodb-native
21:27 < etcetera> I'm writing a blog post and trying to understand the consensus. 
21:27 < dminus> ruby can be an easier sell to mgmt than node
21:27 < RushPL> so you can do high level stuff without losing understanding
21:27 < dminus> thats not a technical merit though
21:28 < CoverSlide> it's kind of like the people who use sinatra over rails
21:28 < CoverSlide> sinatra assumes less
21:28 < CoverSlide> some people like a blanker canvas to work with
21:28 < CoverSlide> and getting ruby to do the low-level http stuff is a lot harder than with node's HTTPServer
21:29 < cloudbender> so true
21:31 < CoverSlide> also, if you've ever written event-based stuff with EventMachine or Twisted or POE, JavaScript's syntax is a bit easier to work with than those, plus the libraries that you depend on will all be non-blocking event-driven as well, as opposed to having an eventloop that does non-blocking stuff but having to rely on a database driver that blocks
21:34 < etcetera> so Ruby uses dedicated threads per request with existing frameworks like Rails?
21:35 < owen1> is there a way for readdirSync to only read files that start with 'test' ?
21:36 < CoverSlide> not entirely sure, haven't gone into the internals of things
21:38 < CoverSlide> owen1: use .filter ?
21:38 < owen1> i didn't know string has it. let me see
21:39 < CoverSlide> not string, Array.prototype.filter
21:39 < owen1> oh
21:41 < andrew12> ['test1.js', 'test2.js', 'notest3.js'].filter(function(f) { return f.indexOf('test') === 0; })
21:41 < andrew12> => [ 'test1.js', 'test2.js' ]
21:41 < niix> ugh twitter is down
21:41 < asturel> is there a function that check is the header already sent?
21:41 < asturel> or how can i avoid Error: Can't set headers after they are sent. ?
21:41 < CoverSlide> there's also the glob package
21:42 < owen1> CoverSlide: filter works! i'll look at the glob as well
21:42 < CoverSlide> asturel: you should have control over whether you sent headers already in your code
21:43 < CoverSlide> asturel: but if you really need it, there's the res._headerSent boolean
21:45 < polotek> asturel: this usually happens if you have middleware that is calling res.write() or piping before you're ready
21:45 < polotek> when you call res.write() the headers are flushed for you because you can't send more headers after that
21:45 < asturel> http://pastebin.com/mFtqWBGb
21:45 < asturel> it fails at line 25
21:45 < asturel> sometimes
21:46 < CoverSlide> what implementations do people tend to use? And what resources do people recommend for a CL beginner?[A[B
21:46 < CoverSlide> oops
21:47 < holzp> asturel, do you have the error trace?
21:48 < asturel> yeah
21:48 < asturel> http://pastebin.com/Y2E1jYWM app.js 115 -> pastebin 25
21:49 < holzp> oh, you sent the headers ahready
21:50 < holzp> somewhere in your response chain someone sent the headers for res already
21:52 < polotek> asturel: you don't seem to be aborting after an error. Just console.logging it and continuing
21:52 < holzp> this is tricky because of the async nature of the code
21:52 < holzp> but something in express alreade wrote the headers for your response out
21:53 < polotek> Either way, there could be any module in your middleware that is doing an early aborting and ending the response
21:53 < holzp> and since its failing sometimes probably its an  async thing
21:53 < holzp> well not aborting early but sending the headers down early
21:53 < holzp> this method: http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_response_writehead_statuscode_reasonphrase_headers
21:54 < holzp> somsone is calling it
21:54 < andrepadez> hi, i am using express and trying to use res.redirect(url) and i get "undefined. Redirecting to http://localhost:8080/owners/edit/50fdb4a57060eecf36000001" .... can someone help me please?
21:54 < asturel> maybe i need to write some proper auth :D
21:54 < holzp> it could be your auth stuff
21:54 < holzp> setting a cookie and writinghead before you get to it yourself
21:54 < asturel> yeah
21:54 < holzp> what other express/connect middleware are you using and in what order were they added?
21:55 < RushPL> CoverSlide: I deleted the build directory in bson
21:55 < RushPL> and it works ..
21:55 < CoverSlide> awesome
21:56 < rideh> Coverslide: while we were talking i fired up another linode and it's almost live
21:56 < rideh> i didnt use a stackscript though, did by hand
21:58 < verysoftoiletppr> anyone has experience with spooky.js? I'm trying to figure out what's the purpose of object named "child" being passed to new Spooky() https://github.com/WaterfallEngineering/SpookyJS#usage
22:00 < AAA_awright> asturel: I hope you're not storing passwords in a database in plaintext
22:00 < AAA_awright> Or keeping passwords in a cookie, for that matter
22:00 < rideh> AAA_awright: i hope someone gets donatos to wake up and stop storing in plaintext
22:00 < CoverSlide> I hope he is
22:00 < CoverSlide> >:)
22:02 < AAA_awright> rideh: Who?
22:02 < rideh> https://www.donatos.com/phoenix-web/menus_features/index.jsp
22:03 < AAA_awright> If this is on GitHub everyone in this channel right now needs to comment on a bug report
22:03 < asturel> AAA_awright why cookie?
22:03 < CoverSlide> donatos probably doesn't do their own web dev
22:03 < asturel> i mean how else do u do autologin?
22:04 < AAA_awright> >_<
22:04 < andrepadez> hi, i am trying to use res.redirect(url) and i get "undefined. Redirecting to http://localhost:8080/owners/edit/50fdb4a57060eecf36000001" .... can someone help me please?
22:04 < AAA_awright> asturel: You send the client a revokable session token which authenticates them, but you never ever store the password anywhere
22:04 < AAA_awright> Not in a cookie, not in the database
22:04 < CoverSlide> there is no issue reporting for crappy third-party web design shops
22:05 < CoverSlide> the only thing they respond to is a massive security breach
22:05 < asturel> if u dont store thw pw how do u know auth ?:D
22:05 < AAA_awright> *you
22:05 < AAA_awright> asturel: That's what a Key Derivation Function is for
22:06 < asturel> anyway i had to use passwords
22:06 < AAA_awright> You can use passwords, just don't store them
22:06 < asturel> then how do i keep them?
22:06 < AAA_awright> With a key derivation function
22:06 < shihan> append ... in plain text somewhere in there
22:06 < holzp> what I like doing to new programmers is overwhelm them with the flaws of their initial design, its helpful
22:07 < asturel> yeah with that u still store the pw
22:07 < CoverSlide> haha they didn't even bother to change the tomcat favicon
22:07 < CoverSlide> how shitty
22:07 < AAA_awright> asturel: If you don't know what that is get someone experienced to help you, because security is too big a deal to get wrong. Even if you're not doing anything of grave importance, people often re-use their passwords for things that are
22:07 < rideh> CoverSlide: worst site i've seen
22:07 < rideh> CoverSlide: for a relatively successful business that is
22:08 < asturel> AAA_awright i used only md5
22:08 < asturel> may i'll switch to sha256 but kdf... :D
22:08 < AAA_awright> CoverSlide: On that donatos website? I see their favicon
22:08 < holzp> asturel, when you get to the point where you really need to care just use OAuth and let people login with other accounts and dont worry about logins and passwords
22:08 < AAA_awright> asturel: And don't use MD5, for anything. If someone asks you to use MD5, trust them *less*
22:08 < CoverSlide> oh hmm ...
22:09 < AAA_awright> Because they're trying to give the impression of security where there is none
22:09 < asturel> holzp this site is for a gameserver
22:09 < CoverSlide> i don't know how i saw that
22:09 < holzp> right, high scores and such
22:09 < asturel> so i have to use pws :D
22:09 < asturel> since it connected to the gamedb
22:09 < holzp> you can get around that though
22:10 < holzp> people login with their other accounts then then can authenticate their user game account 
22:10 < asturel> anyway i dont get why is cookie so wrong
22:10 < CoverSlide> oh ok their find a store thing it shows the tomcat. 
22:10 < holzp> then you just link them up
22:10 < holzp> that one time
22:10 < holzp> thats one way to do it
22:11 < AAA_awright> asturel: You can use passwords without storing them anywhere
22:11 < asturel> since they cant decode the cookie pw
22:11 < AAA_awright> If you store passwords anywhere, you risk people seeing them. Obviously, that's BAD
22:11 < asturel> when u say 'store passwords' u mean plaintext?
22:11 < AAA_awright> Yes
22:11 < asturel> oh
22:11 < asturel> i dont do that..
22:12 < isaacbw> use sha256, too
22:12 < isaacbw> sha1 is too easy to crack
22:12 < AAA_awright> A hash function shouldn't be used by itself
22:12 < asturel> basicly i used salt+md5
22:12 < AAA_awright> If you need to check the integrity of a message, you need to use an HMAC
22:12 < AAA_awright> If you need to generate a key or other hash from a low-security source, use a Key Derivation Function
22:13 < AAA_awright> asturel: You're checking if cookie exists in the database...
22:13 < rideh> if we really want to get down to it, unless you have them giving blood samples its not secure, dont do it!
22:13 < isaacbw> AAA_awright, why isn't the hash function useful by itself?
22:13 < asturel> AAA_awright store cookie in database.. what?:D
22:13 < AAA_awright> isaacbw: Because length-extension attacks...
22:13 < CoverSlide> and voiceprint authentication
22:14 < CoverSlide> i mean they could just cut you and steal your blood
22:14 < isaacbw> AAA_awright, it would take a long time to crack sha256
22:14 < CoverSlide> not if you're China
22:14 < CoverSlide> are you ???
22:14 < AAA_awright> isaacbw: Doesn't matter. If I know HASH(K), then I can also calculate HASH(CONCAT(K, extra)) without knowing K
22:15 < AAA_awright> isaacbw: That means if you use a plain hash algorithm, I can append data to your signed documents, and make it look like you signed it
22:15 < isaacbw> I see
22:15 < AAA_awright> Obviously, that's bad
22:15 < AAA_awright> So use HMAC-SHA-256, or use SHA-512 and cut the output in half
22:16 < AAA_awright> asturel: You're getting the value of a cookie and checking to see if that literal value is someone's password
22:17 < AAA_awright> asturel: The only correct way to do it is to send them a session identifier, and grant that session permissions that you can later revoke
22:18 < AAA_awright> If you can't keep a server state, you may use an HMAC and sign the cookie saying "I the server grant the ability to browse as this user for this duration of time"
22:19 < AAA_awright> But that's easy to get wrong... I've made mistakes just implementing that, that were in my code for months
22:20 < AAA_awright> isaacbw: Just like you shouldn't use a block cipher directly, without a Block Cipher Mode, hash algorithms need a layer on top to operate with, depending on your use, either an HMAC or a KDV. Very rarely do you need to use a hash directly.
22:21 < asturel> u will be suprised how many site uses plaintext pw :D
22:21 < asturel> when i do pw recovery and they just send my pw.. :D
22:22 < AAA_awright> I should say MAC, HMAC being the MAC of choice (though you can also use a hash function with at least 512 bits of output and cut it in half), and for KDF I recommend PBKDF2
22:22 < AAA_awright> asturel: That's wrong
22:22 < AAA_awright> asturel: Also what's with the ":D" and the "u"s
22:22 < shihan> there are a number of hosting companies out there that love to email you your details when you sign up, including the password... that just blows me away really
22:22 < AAA_awright> This is IRC, man
22:23 < asturel> so s/u/bro/g ?
22:23 < AAA_awright> A one-time login password is alright, but longer than that is wrong
22:23 < AAA_awright> And of course, password reset tokens should be treated with the same care as passwords, make sure they use a good hash, etc
22:23 < AAA_awright> aren't stored in the database.

22:24 < jocafa> gah, my isp is having severe issues today
22:28 < andrepadez> hi, can someone help me with an express problem in "res.redirect()"?
22:28 < cloudbender> AAA_awright any thoughts about mozilla's 'persona' effort ?
22:28 < wibby> npm install gives me "Error: npm doesn't work with node v0.8.18". my package file is nothing but the one on http://expressjs.com/guide.html
22:29 < CoverSlide> andrepadez: show us the code you wrote and we'll find out what you did wrong
22:29 < AAA_awright> CoverSlide: Is that where you have to use your email address? idk how much I like that, it seems to be even more hassle than OpenID or similar
22:29 < AAA_awright> er, cloudbender
22:30 < wibby> It also says "Required: node@0.4 || 0.5" which I find rather hard to believe
22:30 < AAA_awright> cloudbender: I'm a fan of WebID personally
22:30 < cloudbender> k
22:30 < AAA_awright> Which uses TLS client certificates
22:30 < cloudbender> copy
22:32 < andrepadez> CoverSlide:  res.redirect(appConfig.application.url[appConfig.env] + model.config.href +'/edit/' + result._id);
22:33 < andrepadez> appConfig.application.url[appConfig.env] + model.config.href +'/edit/' + result._id resolves to http://localhost:8080/owners/edit/50fdb4a57060eecf36000001"
22:33 < andrepadez> and i get "undefined. Redirecting to http://localhost:8080/owners/edit/50fdb4a57060eecf36000001"
22:38 < wibby> in fact, all npm commands give me "npm doesn't work with node v0.8.18". I just compiled and installed it, did I do anything wrong?
22:39 < isaacbw> did you update npm as well
22:40 < amunra> so i have this little piece of code that creates a form to upload a file. http://pastebin.com/kMWvCGAB my question is though, how can i upload the file without having to go on the browser to select the file to upload? can i already preset the file destination and have it upload the file by itself? sorry i'm still learning.
22:41 < ben_alman> does anyone know of a general data validation library? like a schema or dtd but for arbitrary data
22:41 < isaacbw> I don't think so amunra 
22:41 < wibby> isaacbw: i think i did? doesn't node 0.8 come with npm?
22:41 < isaacbw> that could lead to security issues
22:42 < isaacbw> what with the browser being a sandbox and all
22:43 < amunra> isaacbw: is there a different method besides using a multipart form that i can upload a file to node js with? someone told me to take a look at http.request and express but i'm a little lost
22:44 < isaacbw> amunra, maybe look at this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/XMLHttpRequest/FormData/Using_FormData_Objects
22:44 < isaacbw> it would still be form data, but you could upload it without a page refresh
22:45 < isaacbw> or http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/uploader/
22:45 < isaacbw> http://geekswithblogs.net/rashid/archive/2007/08/01/Create-An-Ajax-Style-File-Upload.aspx
22:45 < isaacbw> the first one is the most modern
22:45 < isaacbw> and since we're node.js users, we're all hip and modern
22:46 < wibby> fixed it, /usr/local/bin/npm pointed to a wrong version
22:46 < isaacbw> wibby, what OS are you on
22:46 < _ior> amunra, i've been using the hidden iframe method for frontend with a combination of formidable on the backend
22:46 < wibby> isaacbw: Debian, but I just fixed it
22:47 < isaacbw> wibby, I bet you could get repo packages for the latest version and not worry about that
22:47 < _ior> amunra, if you're okay with writing to disk, the formidable default methods make it very simple to plug and play
22:47 < _ior> (however if you want to be streamy with the data you may have to play around with encoding types, and that can be poorly documented)
22:59 < isaacbw> ima cook some ratatouille
22:59 < isaacbw> this is gonna be the shit
23:02 < rcombs> does using streamspeed on an http.clientRequest correctly measure the actual speed of the connection?
23:02 < rcombs> ( https://npmjs.org/package/streamspeed )
23:03 < rcombs> if not, how would you recommend doing a speed test?
23:13 -!- mode/#Node.js [+o piscisaureus_] by ChanServ
23:42 < CrawfordComeaux> best boilerplate using express, mongoose, connect and socket.io....GO!
23:42 < CoverSlide> ima cook this bitch some ratatouille. bitches love ratatouille
23:55 < CoverSlide> if you're using a boilerplate, you failed at life
23:57 < jocafa> harsh
