this repo posts [the node.js irc channel logs](http://static.izs.me/irclogs/node.js/)
in a way that individual irc messages are indexed by google.

the list of messages and corresponding links are listed [here](http://he-said-she-said.github.io).

there are something like 650,000 individual messages, so those are posted at unique
url's of the following form:


```text
http://he-said-she-said.github.io/docs/<year>/<month>/<day>/<hours>_<minutes>_<seonds>_<irc handle>.txt
```

for example:

```text
http://he-said-she-said.github.io/docs/2013/5/9/0_0_1_lamalex.txt
```

these can be searched with something like [this](https://encrypted.google.com/#hl=en&q=security%20site%3Ahe-said-she-said.github.io%2Fdocs):
